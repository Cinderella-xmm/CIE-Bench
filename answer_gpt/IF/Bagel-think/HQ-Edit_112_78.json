      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a cylindrical container with a transparent body resembling glass, featuring intricate embossed patterns around its sides.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a lid with a decorative finial design, which is characteristic of a candle holder's snuffer.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A reflective marble base is visible at the bottom of the object in Image B, replacing any previous fabric surface. This shift from the detailed lace tablecloth in Image A to marble in Image B is evidenced by the distinct marble texture and gloss visible in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a nameplate attached to the side of the container, but the text reads 'Eauxld Envie,' rather than 'Elegance Aroma.' The presence of a nameplate in Image B contrasts with the absence of one on the teapot in Image A, reinforcing the product transformation. However, the specific text does not match the phrase in the question.",
