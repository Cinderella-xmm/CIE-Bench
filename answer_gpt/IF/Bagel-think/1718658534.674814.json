      "question": "Is the figurine made of a glossy, smooth ceramic material instead of knitted yarn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine exhibits a glossy and reflective surface which is characteristic of ceramic materials, especially those with a smooth finish. The rich color and reflective quality support the conclusion that it is not made from yarn but rather of a more solid and polished material. In contrast, Image A shows a knitted yarn construction with evident texture typical of fabric materials.",

      "question": "Is the figurine's color a vibrant terracotta tone (a rich reddish-brown)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the figurine in a vibrant reddish-brown which aligns well with what is known as terracotta tones. This color is a warm earth tone often associated with clay or ceramic decorations. Observing these characteristics confirms the understanding that the figurine in Image B has a vibrant terracotta tone.",

      "question": "Are there visible intricate floral engravings on the surface of the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On Image B, the figurine features detailed floral engravings that are prominently visible on its body. These engraved patterns are part of the surface design, enhancing the ornamental aspect of the ceramic material. Conversely, Image A has no engravings, indicating a plain yarn texture. This comparison shows that Image B has this detailed design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the eyes resemble small polished amber stones in color, texture, and appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents eyes that appear to have the color and translucency of polished amber, which are deeper and richer in hue. Their glossy finish contributes to the perception of polished stone. Image A, on the other hand, shows simple button-like eyes typical for knitted toys, without the amber-like characteristics. Hence, the eyes in Image B do resemble polished amber stones.",

      "question": "Is the figurine placed on a simple wooden tabletop with a minimalist background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B shows the figurine sitting on a wooden surface that is simple in design, along with a minimalist, softly blurred backdrop. This setup emphasizes the foreground object without distracting elements, which is typical in minimalist arrangements. Image A instead has a plain gray background without a visible tabletop, affirming the difference.",
