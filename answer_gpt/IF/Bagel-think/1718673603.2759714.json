      "question": "Are all structural elements of the Japanese house rendered as colored glass panels bounded by black lead lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Japanese house is depicted with clear sections divided by black lines, resembling a stained glass effect. Each panel of glass is bound by black lead lines, which is characteristic of stained glass art, where the pieces of colored glass are held together by lead came. This visual information firmly indicates that the structural elements of the house are intended to appear as colored glass panels.",

      "question": "Are the red trees replaced with stylized floral motifs made of red and green segmented glass pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows red trees that are fragmented into stained glass styling. The trees are not explicitly replaced with floral motifs but instead maintain their arboreal form while being comprised of segmented glass pieces in shades of red and some green, which serves as foliage. This segmentation into glass pieces is part of the stained glass style and retains the original reference to foliage rather than floral motifs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the large red moon rendered using multiple overlapping or concentric gradient circles in shades of red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large moon is depicted using stained glass segments rather than a smooth gradient or overlapping circles. The stained glass effect relies on the use of distinct segments of color to create images rather than the gradual shading or layering used to depict gradients. Therefore, the moon is not shown with overlapping or concentric gradient circles but rather with color blocks typical of stained glass art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all major elements (house, trees, moon) clearly outlined with thick, black, continuous lines resembling lead came in stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes thick, black, continuous lines to outline the house, trees, and moon, similar to the lead came technique used in stained glass artwork to separate pieces of colored glass. This method of outlining is consistent across all major elements in the image, solidifying the style's resemblance to stained glass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall scene maintain the original composition (house centered, trees flanking, moon above, water in foreground) while all elements are styled as stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By analyzing Image B, it is apparent that the overall composition remains consistent with the original image: the house is centered, flanked by trees on either side, the moon is situated above, and there is water in the foreground. All these components have been converted to a stained glass style, but their positioning and relative layout have not changed, preserving the original composition.",
