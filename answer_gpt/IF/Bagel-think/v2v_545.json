      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sparrow depicted in a 3D-rendered form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sparrow with smooth, rounded edges and even textures, characteristics of 3D rendering often found in animated models. The bird's features do not exhibit the organic variance typical in real-world textures and form, thus indicating a 3D-rendered style.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit the animation style characteristic of Pixar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the sparrow and chair with polished, uniform surfaces and simplified detailings common in the 3D animation style seen in Pixar movies. Though it doesn't exactly replicate the Pixar aesthetic, it shares various elements like clean textures and stylized realism suggesting a Pixar-like influence.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the sparrow perched on the wooden chair in a realistic manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sparrow seated on the chair naturally, maintaining correct proportions, and the pose aligns with how a real sparrow might perch. This combination of realistic features with stylized textures suggests a believable stance, absent any exaggerated dimensions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals polished textures on both the chair and the sparrow. The surfaces are smooth, with ample light reflection suggesting a high degree of polish, but the detail is more generalized indicating it focuses on simplicity rather than intricacy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses warm and solid colors like the brown of the chair and the varied tones of the sparrow's plumage. These colors are vibrant and blend harmoniously, enhancing the overall liveliness of the image without overwhelming intensity.",
