      "question": "Are the cardinal and blue jay depicted as 3D anthropomorphic figurines with human-like features and sculptural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal and blue jay are presented as 3D figurines, resembling sculptures within a shadow box. They have a realistic bird appearance, without human-like features. These figurines are detailed and textured to resemble their natural counterparts and are not anthropomorphic, as they do not exhibit human traits, expressions, or behaviors. Thus, referring to them as anthropomorphic would be incorrect.",
