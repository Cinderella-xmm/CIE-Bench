        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gnome's environment is modified with added product elements.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original woven basket from Image A is complemented with flat, rectangular seed packets which are labeled with illustrative designs and wording.
