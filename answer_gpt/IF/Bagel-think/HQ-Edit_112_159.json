      "question": "Is the car and coastal road enclosed within a transparent glass display case with visible edges and reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car and coastal road are indeed enclosed within a transparent structure, which resembles a display case. This is evident from the clear edges and reflections that are visible along the boundaries of the structure. These visual cues suggest that the scene is enclosed in glass or a similar material, quite commonly used in display cases to protect and showcase items.",

      "question": "Does the car exhibit metallic red coloring with visible gradient hues across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car exhibits a glossy, metallic red finish. The surface of the car shows variations in lighting and shading, creating visible gradient hues. These gradients are typical of metallic finishes where reflections and changes in light can cause the color to appear different in various areas, confirming the presence of metallic red coloring with gradient hues.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible dynamic curves and sharp detail lines present on the car’s bodywork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car's bodywork features visible dynamic curves and sharp detail lines. These details are prominent as they contribute to the car's sleek design, giving it an aerodynamic and visually appealing appearance. Such curves and lines are characteristic of sports or performance vehicles, enhancing both aesthetics and functionality.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the road and cliffs appear to be constructed from layered resin, showing visible stratification and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road and cliffs do not exhibit the appearance of being constructed from layered resin. While they are detailed and have depth, the texture and visual aspect are more indicative of a photograph or digital rendering of a natural scene rather than something constructed with resin showcasing stratification.",

      "question": "Are micro gravel textures visibly embedded in the road and cliff surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the road and surrounding landscape do not show visible textures that mimic embedded micro gravel. The image appears more polished and smooth, typical of a digital illustration rather than one where textures like gravel are evident.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is there a sunset sky panel placed at the top of the display case, forming part of the diorama’s upper boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of a separate sunset sky panel placed at the top of the display case. While the backdrop and setting include a sunset scene, it forms a continuous part of the diorama and does not serve as an independent top boundary panel of the display case.",
