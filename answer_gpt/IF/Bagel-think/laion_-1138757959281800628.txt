    "Question": "Q3: Are the sunbathers and surrounding trees visibly miniaturized in size relative to the building and pool?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sunbathers and trees appear disproportionally small compared to the building and pool, suggesting a miniaturized effect. The visual cues point towards a scale perception commonly observed in model-like representations where smaller accessories emphasize the size of primary objects, consistent with stylization techniques. This general approach would suggest the existence of miniaturization. Comparing with Image A, where proportions seem normal, Image B's objects indeed seem smaller.",
