      "question": "Is there a collectible packaging box visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear depiction of a packaging box with contents inside, which is characteristic of collectible packaging. The presence of a boxed arrangement with figures and accessories inside visually confirms the typical appearance of a collectible packaging box found in the toy industry.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the packaging box rendered in an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An isometric perspective would show the box from an angle where three sides (top, front, and side) are visible simultaneously, typically providing the appearance of depth. In Image B, the packaging box is visible from a front-facing angle which does not demonstrate this perspective.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"DUAL TRANSFORMER HEROES\" visible on the packaging box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text on the packaging box in Image B is 'DUR-FARGES,' which is prominently displayed. The question asks about a different text 'DUAL TRANSFORMER HEROES,' which is not present on the box.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are chibi-style versions of the car and robot present inside the packaging box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi-style refers to a stylized, cute representation with exaggerated features. In Image B, inside the packaging box, there is a depiction of the car and robot alongside the reference to chibi figures. However, the displayed figures do not exhibit typical chibi characteristics, as they seem to be regular models instead.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the chibi figures inside the box rendered in vibrant metallic red and black colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures inside Image B's packaging box are likely to be stylized with a predominant red and black color palette resembling a metallic sheen. However, these figures themselves do not encapsulate the chibi-style, as they appear to be regular figures instead.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the mini tool set, interchangeable helmets, and gear base visible inside the packaging box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, besides the described car and robot figures, there are visible accessories that could include wheels or tools, but no interchangeable helmets or a gear base indicated in the question are clearly visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the full-sized car and robot figures displayed outside the packaging box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the full-sized car and robot figures are positioned outside the packaging box. They are depicted entirely separate from the boxed arrangement, confirming their presence outside.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures outside the box in Image B resemble toys with typical toy-like textures and design rather than realistic textures or lifelike appearances. Their stylization does not reflect high realism usually associated with life-like renderings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are the figures placed in a polished showcase environment with reflective surfaces or professional lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting does not exhibit elements like polished showcase environments, reflective surfaces, or professional lighting commonly found in high-end displays. The figures appear in a more basic setup without these enhanced display features.",
