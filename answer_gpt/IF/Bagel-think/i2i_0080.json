      "question": "Does the image include a depiction of the dog from its left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the dog facing towards the right side of the frame, which indicates the depiction is from its left side. Observing the dog's body position, with its head turned away from the viewer's left, supports the conclusion that it's the left side view.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dog illustrated from its back view within the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the dog is depicted in profile from the side view as indicated by the visible features such as the side of the head, ears, and body. There is no back view that typically shows only the rear features of an animal without the side details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both the left side and back views of the dog combined into a single image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a clear left side view without incorporating any back view elements. The visibility of the dog's head, front legs, and tail positioned to one side indicates only the side view is depicted without combination with a back view.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dog shown on the bed in both the left side and back views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog is illustrated on the bed from the left side view in Image B. Since there is no back view or a depiction combining both views, the answer to this question is based solely on the left side view.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bed and bedsheet appear consistently in both views of the dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B only displays a single view of the dog from the left side. Thus, the consistency of the bed and bedsheet cannot be validated between two different views as only one is provided.",
