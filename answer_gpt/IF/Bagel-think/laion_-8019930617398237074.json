      "question": "Has the overall image been transformed into a postcard-style composition with a romantic aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a design consistent with traditional postcard elements: artistic coloring, a composition like a vintage card, and decorative themes. These details, especially romantic motifs like floral patterns and watercolor backgrounds, contribute to the overall romantic aesthetic typical of postcards.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are asymmetrical floral patterns visible in the image, particularly on one side of the gown or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a notable floral pattern that appears on one side of the gown and continues into the design of the background. Asymmetry is apparent as the pattern is not uniform across the entire image but concentrated more on one side, commonly associated with artistic and romantic designs.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a visible pastel-colored lace overlay applied to the image, particularly on the dress or surrounding area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes soft, pastel hues as part of its background and dress design. However, the term 'lace overlay' is not entirely fitting as the visible design features more of a watercolor effect rather than a lace effect.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hands are indeed positioned as if holding a bouquet, which is visible and consistent with a romantic aesthetic. This gesture is typical in bridal or romantic imagery, where bouquets are often featured prominently.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],

      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the postcard visually enclosed within a delicate paper sleeve, such as a light-colored, textured frame or envelope-like border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
