        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the couple sitting on the bench appears to have been altered to have a mosaic or fragmented crystal appearance. The contours of their bodies now have an iridescent quality resembling crystal or glass, creating a distinct silhouette from the original image. This suggests that their backs have indeed been designed as crystal silhouettes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouettes in Image B retain a general human form and posture reminiscent of the original figures in Image A.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The couple's silhouettes in Image B have been modified to display properties similar to crystal or glass. These materials are known for their reflective and sometimes transparent qualities. The edited silhouettes appear to capture and reflect light, indicating their crystal-like nature reflects this change.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment around the couple, including the bench, tree, and grass, appears to be identical to that in Image A. The light and shadows, as well as the composition of the park, remain consistent, indicating that only the couple's appearance has been modified.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B features a couple with crystal silhouettes, creating a romantic and elegant visual. The use of light, crystal-like texture, and the affectionate pose are elements that resonate with Valentine's Day themes, which often celebrate love and beauty.
