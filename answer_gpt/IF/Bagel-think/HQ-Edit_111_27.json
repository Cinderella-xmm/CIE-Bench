      "question": "Does the geisha's figure appear as a stained glass artwork with distinct lead-like outlines separating colored sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure of the geisha is characterized by bold, black outlines that are typical of stained glass art. These outlines create distinct separations between brightly colored sections, giving the appearance of stained glass panels, where each color is constrained within its section by lead-like lines.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the kimono patterns composed of flowing, curvilinear organic designs such as vines or flowers, rendered in vivid jewel tones (e.g., deep reds, blues, greens)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono of the geisha does not feature flowing, organic designs typical of vines or flowers. Instead, the colors are separated into solid blocks due to the stained glass effect, and there are no intricate patterns like vines or flowers that one would expect to see in traditional kimono art rendered with jewel tones. Therefore, Image B lacks these curvilinear organic designs.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms depicted as glass-like elements with segmented petals, dark outlines, and translucent coloring typical of stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms have a segmented appearance with dark outlines, consistent with the style of stained glass art. They have a glassy quality where each petal is distinct and outlined, enhancing the effect of stained glass where light can filter through. This depiction matches the characteristics expected in stained glass art.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the traditional hand fan been replaced with a peacock-style fan featuring eye-patterned feathers and iridescent, multi-colored surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the original fan structure seen in Image A, which is fan-shaped and not replaced with any peacock-like fan. The fan does not have eye-patterned feathers or exhibit iridescent, multi-colored surfaces typical of a peacock fan. Instead, it maintains the original segmented style consistent with stained glass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background composed of curving, interwoven lines and shaded areas forming an abstract mosaic pattern consistent with Art Nouveau design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a grid-like pattern with strong vertical and horizontal lines, similar to the frame structures seen in stained glass, rather than the organic, interwoven, and curving lines typical of Art Nouveau designs. The design is more linear and segmented without the abstract mosaic pattern associated with Art Nouveau.",
