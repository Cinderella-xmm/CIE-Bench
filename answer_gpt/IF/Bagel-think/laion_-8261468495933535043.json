      "question": "Are the sausages, salad, and egg completely replaced by glass tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages, salad, and egg are visibly composed of tiles, giving the appearance of a mosaic. This suggests that the original food items have been artistically transformed using a tile pattern overlay, emulating the look of a mosaic art piece rather than actual glass tiles. Therefore, while the appearance is of tiles, they are used to simulate the objects and not physically replaced with glass tiles.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages have been rendered using tiles in shades that resemble warm terracotta tones, which are typically red, orange, and brown hues. This choice of color effectively captures the warmth commonly associated with cooked sausages.",

        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area representing the egg displays tiles predominantly in sunny yellow tones for the yolk, while the surrounding egg white is composed of contrasting white tiles. This mosaic layout is intended to mimic the visual appearance of a sunny-side-up egg.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the tiles for the sausages appear larger and less detailed compared to those used for the lettuce, which are smaller and allow for a more intricate pattern to capture the textures and nuances of leafy greens.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a mosaic composition involving various food items arranged on a plate. The arrangement is not strictly symmetrical as the sausages, salad, and egg are positioned differently on the plate, and the background is a plain ceramic surface, which is traditional for serving. The layout prioritizes artistic presentation over symmetry.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is designed to be artistically cohesive, presenting a vibrant mosaic rendition of food items on a plate. The use of various tile colors and patterns simulates the appearance and enhances artistic creativity, aligning well with mosaic art. It is worth noting that the term 'glass tiles' might be more metaphorical here as they're not real but represent the idea of mosaic artistry.",
