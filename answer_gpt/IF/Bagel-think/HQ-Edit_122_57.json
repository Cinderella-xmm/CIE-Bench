      "question": "Is the vase now composed of clear, faceted crystal material that mimics the original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is depicted as a clear, faceted crystal structure. This is evident from the transparent and reflective qualities of the material, which are characteristic of crystal. However, unlike the originally ornate and painted ceramic vase in Image A, the crystal vase in Image B is devoid of the intricate design elements and appears to be simpler in form overall. Thus, the vase has indeed been reimagined as a crystal piece.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the decorative panels on the vase replaced with etched abstract floral patterns in crystal, rather than painted figures or scenes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the vase as being minimalistic and lacking painted figures or scenes. Instead, it features no discernible etched floral patterns that would suggest a replacement of decorative panels. This contrasts with Image A which has detailed painted figures on the ceramic surface. The abstraction in Image Bâ€™s design indicates that the decorative aspect has shifted towards a simpler crystal style, but there are no specific etched patterns visible.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all the flowers been replaced with pastel-colored, translucent, intricately carved crystal blossoms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement contains flowers that appear to be made from a translucent material, presenting a pastel color palette seen in crystal art. This outright replaces the organic colorful variety from Image A with a carved crystal form as deduced from their translucent, light-dispersing qualities, suggesting a significant design alteration towards ornamental crystal artistry.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the vase placed on a minimalist, flat, reflective mirrored pedestal that shows a clear reflection of the vase and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the vase on a flat pedestal which appears to be a reflective surface, as seen by the clarity and mirror-like properties underneath. This pedestal replaces the ornate tabletop of Image A, indicative of a more contemporary, minimalist approach with a mirrored finish that aligns perfectly with modern design aesthetics.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crystal vase maintain the same overall shape, size, and structural features (such as handles and foot) as the original ornate vase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the vase is not maintained in the same shape nor does it possess the structural features like the ornate handles or decorative foot observed in Image A. The crystal vase is more simplified and rounded compared to the embellished original vase, losing specific structural characteristics during the transformation to a crystal piece.",
