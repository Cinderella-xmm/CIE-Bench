      "question": "Is the cup and saucer combined into a single, oval-shaped object resembling a mythical phoenix egg?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object atop the saucer is not an ordinary cup. It resembles an ornate, egg-like shape with what appears to be feathers and jewel-like elements, which could poetically be depicted as a mythical phoenix egg. The visual cues and the transformation from a typical cup to this ornate object suggests this mythical representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original floral patterns on the cup seem to have been replaced by designs that are more intricate and feather-like, with elongated curved lines resembling feathers rather than floral motifs. This suggests a transformation from floral to feather-like patterns.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle in Image B has been drastically altered from the simple loop handle in Image A. It is now more elaborate, mimicking the structure of a wing with feathered details, which enhances its ornate and mythical appearance, consistent with the phoenix theme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The saucer's rim in Image B still retains the floral pattern found in Image A, and no distinct textures that resemble a nest or jewel-like accents are visible on this part of the image. Thus, it does not resemble a decorative nest.",
