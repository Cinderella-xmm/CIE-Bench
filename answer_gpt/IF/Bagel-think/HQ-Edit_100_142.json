    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image display visible, textured brushstrokes across the entire composition, consistent with Impressionist painting techniques?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visible, textured brushstrokes are present throughout the composition. This is evident in the exaggerated and dynamic patterns in the subject's clothing and background, similar to techniques used in Impressionist paintings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the scene lit with warm, golden-hour lighting suggestive of dusk, with soft shadows and a glowing horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features very bright and vivid colors with a strong yellow palette. While it suggests warmth, it is more extreme in color saturation compared to typical golden-hour lighting. The lighting in Image B lacks the subtlety and soft shadows typically associated with dusk or golden-hour lighting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the patterns and colors of the subject’s clothing rendered with thick, visible brushstrokes that exaggerate their vibrancy and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s clothing displays thick, visible brushstrokes that enhance the vibrancy and texture of the patterns and colors. This contributes to a bold and dynamic visual style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of soft, blended warm golden hues with no distinct details, creating a hazy, atmospheric effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background is characterized by vibrant, warm hues and dynamic brushstrokes rather than soft, blended colors. The lack of distinct detail aligns somewhat with a hazy effect, but the intensity of colors doesn't convey a fully soft or atmospheric feel typical of Impressionist paintings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the drum surface show layered, textured paint application that gives it a three-dimensional, tactile appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drum surface displays clear brushstroke textures that suggest depth and layering, contributing to a three-dimensional and tactile effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the grass and trees in the background stylized with flowing or angular forms that visually mirror the rhythmic motion of the drummer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B doesn't specifically mirror the rhythmic motion of the drummer through stylized forms. While the brushstrokes are dynamic, they don't emulate patterns or rhythm consistent with the motion of drumming.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
