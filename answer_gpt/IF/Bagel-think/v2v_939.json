      "question": "Is the character depicted in a cute chibi-style 3D design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a character with a simplified and stylized form, emphasizing a larger head and smaller body proportions, consistent with the cute and exaggerated features typical of the chibi-style character design. This involves using cartoon-like facial attributes and rounded shapes, often found in 3D designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the chibi character placed in front of the same wall and drainpipe as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background wall and drainpipe are visually similar to those in Image A in terms of color, texture, and position, indicating that the chibi character stands in front of the same setting originally depicted. The logical reasoning includes picturing the setting's unchanged characteristics relative to the original image's alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi character hold an oversized and brightly colored umbrella?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is positioned underneath a prominent umbrella, with vivid colors covering a significant portion above the character's head relative to its body size. This oversized appearance is subject to the chibi-style proportions where items appear larger. Bright colors are evident in the visible red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple sections.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there playful raindrops surrounding the chibi character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B introduces elements that resemble raindrops, stylistically amplified to appear scattered around the scene. These raindrops add a whimsical touch and resemble illustrations often used to enhance the playful elements in chibi-style designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the environment been subtly enhanced to make the rain and reflections appear more vivid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the enhancements in the visual effects, such as more pronounced reflections and textured raindrops, suggest a purposefully livelier representation of rainfall compared to Image A's realism. This observation comes from understanding visual effects techniques that create an exaggerated sense of realism and vivacity in cartoon-style designs.",
