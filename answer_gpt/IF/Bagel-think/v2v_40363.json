        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the artwork is presented in a mosaic style.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors appear bright and vivid. The red heart balloon and other features such as the child's silhouette show strong and saturated colors.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) exhibits characteristics typical of ceramic mosaic tile work, where the tiles often have a glossy finish that can catch light and reflect it. The varying shades and reflections in the image suggest the presence of a glossy finish, which is consistent with ceramic tile artwork.",
