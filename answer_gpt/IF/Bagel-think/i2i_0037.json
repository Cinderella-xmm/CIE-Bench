      "question": "Does the image have a white border frame surrounding it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct surrounding white border that is evident at the edges around the main visual content. This type of border is commonly associated with styles such as those of Polaroid photographs, which enhances its retro or vintage appeal. Observing this characteristic is straightforward as it's a prominent feature of the image's presentation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a handwritten caption at the bottom of the image that reads “Banana Cream Dream 2024”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B indeed contains a handwritten-style caption at the bottom. However, upon closer inspection, the text reads \"Banana Cream\" rather than \"Banana Cream Dream 2024,\" although the number \"2028\" is present beneath ‘Banana Cream.’ Thus, while there is a caption present, it does not match the exact text specified in the question.",

      "question": "Does the image exhibit a light brown vintage filter that gives the appearance of a film-style photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visuals have been altered with a filter that reduces the vibrancy and adds a slight sepia or brown tone to the overall image. This effect is commonly utilized to evoke nostalgia or a vintage aesthetic often associated with old film photographs. The desaturation and brownish tint in Image B support this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the image presented in a Polaroid style with the combination of the white border frame and vintage filter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains both a white border frame and the application of a vintage filter, helping it resemble a Polaroid-style image. Polaroid photos are characteristic for having such borders, often in addition to a caption area, and often exhibit such retro color tones typical of older photography techniques. Thus combined, the attributes in Image B concisely reflect the Polaroid style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the original dessert appearance been preserved without any changes apart from the added frame, caption, and filter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, Image B applies certain post-processing effects such as a vintage filter and Polaroid-style border. Yet, these changes are overlaid onto the original image without altering the fundamental appearance of the dessert itself. The dessert’s appearance, including elements like bananas and whipped cream, remains unchanged from its initial visual in Image A, aside from the filter application.",
