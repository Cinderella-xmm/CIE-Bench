    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the medieval structure as a colossal stone golem with a humanoid form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure has been transformed to resemble a humanoid form with distinct limbs and features, characteristic of a golem. The edited portions show arms, torso, and a head, replacing what was previously a simple architectural feature. This transformation into a humanoid figure is consistent with the form of a golem.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the archways visibly transformed into articulated limbs resembling arms or legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the archways can be seen integrated into the humanoid structure as elements forming what appears to be legs, contrasting Image A where the arches only serve as architectural features without additional context. The transformation of arches into limbs in the edited image suggests an anthropomorphic reinterpretation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the battlements at the top of the structure resemble a crown-like shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top section with battlements is visually altered to create a resemblance to a crown, particularly through their positioning and the added prominence as part of the humanoid figure. This contrasts with Image A where battlements serve purely as fortification elements without resembling a crown.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are glowing ancient glyphs visible across the surface of the structure, replacing the original wall texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features noticeable glowing glyphs across the surface of the edited structure, which are distinguishable from the original masonry texture seen in Image A. These glyphs convey a mystical or ancient quality that appears superimposed onto the structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the stone golem silhouetted against the sky with a mystical aura emanating from its shadowed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golem-like figure appears prominently with glowing elements creating a mystical aura around parts of its silhouette. These elements are unique to the edited image and diverge from the non-animated, static stone structure silhouette seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the small human figure been replaced by a luminous, ethereal wisp-like entity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figure remains unchanged from Image A, appearing with solid form and outline alongside the dog. There is no transformation into an ethereal or wisp-like presence in the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible ethereal effects such as soft glows, light particles, or magical ambiance added to the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains ethereal effects exemplified by glowing glyphs and elements on the structure, contributing to a magical ambiance. These additions, including soft glows, distinguish Image B's enhanced scene from the unaltered setting in Image A.",
