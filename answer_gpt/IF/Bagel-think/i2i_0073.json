      "question": "Has the reflection in the mirror been replaced with a nighttime city skyline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection appears to display a nighttime city skyline, which is characterized by the presence of tall buildings with lights, a dark sky, and a water reflection, all common features of a cityscape photo at night. This is distinctly different from a typical mirror reflection one would expect above a sink. This analysis indicates a replacement of the original reflection with the city skyline.",

      "question": "Does the new reflection in the mirror enhance visual depth compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the plain mirror would have normally reflected the bathroom space but does not contribute any additional visual depth because it only reflects what's in front of it. In Image B, the nighttime city skyline introduces an illusion of an infinite space extending beyond the mirror, creating an enhanced visual depth compared to the original. The addition of a cityscape suggests an expansive area beyond what is actually there, adding a perception of depth.",

      "question": "Is the mirror's position and frame identical to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By closely examining both images, Image B shows that the mirror's position and frame are consistent with the original depicted in Image A. There appear to be no alterations in the size, shape, or placement of the mirror within the bathroom setting, only its content (reflection) has been changed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the new reflection include elements indicative of a nighttime setting, such as a dark sky and lit buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection in Image B showcases a city skyline against a dark backdrop with illuminated buildings, which are characteristic elements of a nighttime setting. These visual cues, such as the dark blue night sky and the artificial lighting on the buildings, clearly indicate that the reflection now presents a nighttime scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing Image B with Image A, it is evident that the sink, countertop, and bathroom accessories have not been altered and remain unchanged. The marble pattern, the placement of the soap dispensers, the plant, and the faucet are visually identical in both images.",
