    {

      "question": "Are the stork's feathers replaced with metallic plates, such as riveted or segmented metal surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon close inspection of the stork, it can be observed that the feathers appear to be replaced with metallic plates. These resemble segmented metal surfaces rather than the natural feathers visible in a real stork. The sheen and texture suggest a metallic structure, indicating an intentional design alteration from biological to mechanical.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the nest materials composed entirely of cogs, gears, and mechanical parts instead of natural twigs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nest in Image B is constructed entirely from cogs, gears, and mechanical parts, rather than the natural twigs present in a typical stork's nest. This signifies a shift from a naturally occurring material to a mechanically constructed nest, echoing the steampunk aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are copper-colored pipes visibly integrated along the roofline of the wooden house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, there are observable copper-colored elements integrated into the roofline of the house, particularly in the form of piping that aligns with the steampunk theme. These pipes are not present in typical house designs, accentuating a deliberate style choice for an industrial appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stork have visible mechanical joints at key limb connections (e.g., legs, neck, wings)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When examining Image B, there's no clear indication of mechanical joints at the key limb areas of the stork, such as its legs or neck. Even though the general appearance reflects a mechanical aspect, visible mechanical joints aren't prominently defined in the depicted bird.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene rendered in a Steampunk style, with consistent use of mechanical components, metallic textures, and industrial design across both the stork and the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire scene in Image B is presented with a steampunk aesthetic, characterized by the use of gears, metallic textures, and industrial design elements. The stork has metallic feathers, the nest is made of mechanical parts, and there are industrial components like gears and pipes integrated into the house structure, exemplifying a coherent steampunk style.",
