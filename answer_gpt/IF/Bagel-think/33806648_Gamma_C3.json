      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the rock arch as a recognizable stone guardian creature with anthropomorphic or guardian-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rock arch has been visually altered to include a bright, abstract pattern that includes luminous vein-like lines and an orb. However, there are no specific features or forms recognizable as anthropomorphic or guardian-like, such as facial features, limbs, or other characteristics associated with guardian creatures. The alterations appear more abstract than representing a stone guardian creature.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible crystalline structures growing along the curved edges of the arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an edited pattern with abstract lines extending from a central luminous point. However, these lines do not resemble or indicate the presence of crystalline structures growing along the arch; they are more like abstract branching patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there luminous, vein-like lines running across the surface of the arch that follow naturalistic branching patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features bright, abstract lines that appear to emanate from a central glowing area within the arch. These lines have a vein-like appearance due to their branching patterns and glow, fitting the description of luminous vein-like lines.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the original arch outline been replaced with skeletal, wing-like protrusions extending from the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rock arch maintains its original outline, and there are no skeletal, wing-like protrusions attached to the structure. The added elements are abstract patterns overlaid on the arch rather than structural changes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there clearly visible runic symbols engraved or etched onto the inner surface of the arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any specific runic symbols or engravings that are characteristic of symbolic or script-like markings. The alterations are abstract additions rather than any distinct symbols or etchings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a glowing orb positioned centrally within the arch, acting as a source of radiance and energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a glowing, circular element positioned centrally in the arch, which resembles an orb. It emits bright light and seems to act as a focal point for the surrounding luminous lines, fitting the description of a source of radiance and energy.",
