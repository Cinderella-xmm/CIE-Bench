    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the black bottle cap been replaced with a transparent or translucent glass stopper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a black bottle cap, there is a golden cap on top of the green container. This suggests that the original black cap has been replaced, but it is not transparent or translucent. Therefore, while there is a replacement, it is not a glass stopper.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are thin, dark-colored reeds visible protruding from the top of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows thin, dark-colored reeds extending from the top of the green container, resembling those typically used in fragrance diffusers to disperse scent. This visual cue indicates the presence of such reeds.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the label display an art deco design with geometric patterns, symmetrical elements, or stylized fonts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label exhibits floral illustrations rather than geometric patterns or symmetrical elements typical of art deco designs. The font style is not distinctly stylized in the manner associated with art deco. Thus, the label does not fit the definition of an art deco design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label and the container display a prominent emerald green color with gold accents, especially in the floral designs and text, which signifies a replacement of the original gold label with emerald green and gold elements.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features illustrations of flowers and botanical elements on the container, visible in the gold designs against the green background. This indicates the presence of such illustrations on the label.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the bottle been transformed into a functional-looking luxury fragrance diffuser with all associated components (stopper, reeds, redesigned label)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original whisky bottle appearance has been modified to resemble a luxury fragrance diffuser. Features include a gold cap (not a stopper), thin reeds emerging from the top, and a redesigned label with botanical elements. These components collectively indicate the transformation into a diffuser.",
