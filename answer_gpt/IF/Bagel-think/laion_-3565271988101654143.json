      "question": "Does the smartphone screen display a sci-fi mission control interface instead of financial charts and stock data?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone screen shows futuristic elements like glowing icons and possibly a control interface, as opposed to the financial charts visible in Image A. This indicates a sci-fi mission control interface replaced the original content. The swap from a real-world financial display to a sci-fi style interface is evident through the visual cues of neon blue and iconography resembling advanced futuristic operations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the smartphone and laptop screens incorporate neon blue colors, maintaining the thematic elements from Image A, where blue was also prominently used. The replacement of the content in Image B did not alter the overall dominance of blue hues, suggesting the edited theme continues to use blue as a core color, enhancing a futuristic appearance which is consistent with the sci-fi aesthetic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases digital elements on the smartphone that could suggest holography or virtual design, but there are no explicit visual cues indicating floating 3D objects extending beyond the confines of the screen. The neon blue interface features suggest futuristic touchscreen interactions, yet without clear holographic emissions or separate widgets, they remain within conventional screen bounds.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image in Image B does not display clear extensions outside the physical screen of the smartphone. While the design is futuristic, creating a depth illusion mainly via glowing icons, it does not visibly extend into a projected holographic form beyond the smartphone’s surface.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no biometrically-related visual elements are present on the hand holding the smartphone. The focus remains on the screen’s contents, which are changed to futuristic elements, and does not incorporate any overlays or graphical features suggesting biometric detection or scanning on the hand itself.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the laptop screen with abstract visuals resembling a futuristic cityscape. In contrast, Image A prominently features data charts and world maps, indicating a complete thematic shift to futuristic scenery in the edited image, which is consistent with sci-fi city depictions.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The futuristic skyline in Image B appears clear and detailed, showing stylized city elements without noticeable pixelation or blur. The clarity of these digital elements suggests the image maintains high resolution and quality within the constraints of the edited sci-fi theme, presenting a crisply rendered futuristic environment.",
