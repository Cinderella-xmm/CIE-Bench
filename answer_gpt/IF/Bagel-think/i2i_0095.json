      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable word 'Shine' that is visible on the mirror surface, which wasn't present.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Shine' in Image B is located at the central area of the mirror. This can be judged by observing its placement relative to the frame of the mirror, visually appearing equidistant from the top and sides. This positioning indicates intentional central alignment, a common practice for aesthetic purposes in design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Shine' not only appears in the mirror but also exhibits a noticeable glow, suggesting a backlit effect. This visual effect is derived from the increased brightness around the letters, which gives them an illuminated appearance distinct from the rest of the mirror surface.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The font used for 'Shine' in Image B is single-lined and sans-serif, typically associated with modern and minimal design. The glowing effect and simple color scheme complement the minimalistic setting of the bathroom, aligning with the unobtrusive and sleek style commonly seen in such interiors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The incorporation of 'Shine' in Image B maintains the original design's minimalistic theme, fitting within the mirror's space without overwhelming other elements. Its placement and understated glow integrate seamlessly into the overall neutral and modern aesthetic, supporting the balance rather than disrupting it.",
