    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the motorcycle been transformed into a collectible-style figure with simplified or stylized proportions suitable for display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is depicted with exaggerated features typical of a collectible figure. The proportions appear more cartoon-like and stylized compared to the lifelike proportions in Image A. These visual cues and the setting in what appears to be a display box suggest that the object is indeed a collectible-style figure.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the collectible figure placed inside a box rendered in isometric projection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the box at an angle where the dimensions and perspective align with characteristics of isometric projection. This method typically lacks perspective distortion and is used to provide an easily perceivable three-dimensionality in design presentations, which the image visually supports.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the motorcycle feature glowing neon accents, hover wheels, and a visible digital interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motorcycle in Image B includes neon accents, visible as glowing lines and patches that are not present in Image A. These accents are stylized to give a futuristic look. Additionally, features such as hover-like qualities and digital interface elements can be inferred from the neon and sci-fi design elements present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text \"FUTURE RIDER\" clearly visible and correctly spelled on the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text beneath the display reads 'FIRURE,' which is neither 'FUTURE' nor 'RIDER' spelled correctly. This suggests that the intended text is either misspelled or intentionally altered into a stylized form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a transparent section on the box that reveals the collectible figure inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collectible motorcycle is visible through the front of a transparent section in the box, which is a common feature for displaying collectible figures. This allows the figure to be seen without opening the box.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a second depiction of the motorcycle next to the box that displays ultra-realistic textures and metallic finishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only one depiction of the stylized motorcycle within the display box. This image does not include another representation of the motorcycle, and comparison with Image A is irrelevant here as it refers strictly to the content within the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
