    "Question": "Q2: Is there a handwritten caption at the bottom of the image that reads “Banana Cream Dream 2024”?",
    "explanation": "Image B indeed contains a handwritten-style caption at the bottom. However, upon closer inspection, the text reads \"Banana Cream\" rather than \"Banana Cream Dream 2024,\" although the number \"2028\" is present beneath ‘Banana Cream.’ Thus, while there is a caption present, it does not match the exact text specified in the question.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the image exhibit a light brown vintage filter that gives the appearance of a film-style photograph?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visuals have been altered with a filter that reduces the vibrancy and adds a slight sepia or brown tone to the overall image. This effect is commonly utilized to evoke nostalgia or a vintage aesthetic often associated with old film photographs. The desaturation and brownish tint in Image B support this observation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the image presented in a Polaroid style with the combination of the white border frame and vintage filter?",
