    "Question": "Q1: Has the woman been converted into an adorable 3D chibi-style character?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character has more stylized features, including a larger head and a smaller body, which are common traits of a 3D chibi-style character. This is a transformation from the original, more realistically proportioned character in Image A. The change in style is evident from the exaggerated proportions and cartoonish appearance.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the character posing confidently in front of the echidna?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character stands with hands on the hips and a forward stance, which are visual cues suggesting a confident pose. This mirrors common confident body language, showing self-assuredness. When compared to Image A, the pose remains similarly confident.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the environment still realistic?",
