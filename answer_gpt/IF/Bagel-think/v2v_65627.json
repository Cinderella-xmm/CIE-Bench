      "question": "Is the elephant's body rendered in a soft grey color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the elephant's body is depicted in a soft grey color. This conclusion is drawn from the visual analysis of gray tones, which impart a softer, more uniform appearance, typical of many cartoon representations. The use of a singular, consistent grey color on the body elements supports the description of 'soft grey,' which is often associated with gentleness and neutrality in color symbolism.",

      "question": "Are the inner ears of the elephant large and pink?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's inner ears are clearly depicted as large and pink. The visual cues show two substantial round areas inside each ear that are distinctly colored in a soft shade of pink, emphasizing the characteristic of large inner ears often seen in stylized elephant drawings. These ears contrast with the remainder of the ear's structure, underscoring the prominence of the pink sections.",

      "question": "Does the elephant wear a small yellow hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts the elephant with a small yellow hat atop its head. This is identified through the visual observation of a compact yellow element positioned on the elephant's head, which is unmistakably shaped like a hat. The yellow color stands out against the grey body, making this accessory easily recognizable.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a bright red and yellow ruffled collar around the elephant's neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the appearance of the edited image, the collar around the elephant's neck lacks the bright red and yellow colors typically associated with circus attire. Instead, the collar is uniformly golden-yellow and rounded, suggesting a different style or aesthetic. This visual conclusion is derived from the lack of the dual-colors described and the simplicity of the neck accessory.",

      "question": "Is the elephant illuminated by a warm, soft spotlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the elephant appears to be highlighted by a warm, soft spotlight. This is evident from the lighting effect that creates a noticeable bright area focusing on the elephant, suggesting the use of stage lighting to draw attention. The surrounding shadows and illumination patterns reinforce the spotlight effect, common in theatrical performances to highlight main subjects.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stage in the edited image is presented with wooden planks characterized by texture and color variations typical of wood, but it lacks specific marks of weathering such as wear marks, discolorations, or damage. It instead appears clean and polished, indicating a freshly maintained surface rather than an aged or worn appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backdrop in Image B consists of a curtain colored in a deep blue with scattered star patterns, resembling a typical theatrical curtain with decorative elements. The visual cues provided show small white stars placed against the dark background, familiar both from star-themed decor and velvet textile patterns used in imaginative settings to create a cosmic effect.",
