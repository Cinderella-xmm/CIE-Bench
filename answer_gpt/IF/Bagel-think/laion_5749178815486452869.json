      "question": "Is the green field depicted as a floating island disconnected from any ground or horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green field appears to connect seamlessly with a horizon, which is indicated by the presence of the oversized apple and the continuation of the land and sky. Common sense suggests that a floating island typically shows distinct separations from surrounding areas, completely lacking any ground connections. In Image A, the original design has a curved horizon with a tree and moon in the background, suggesting the field is grounded and not floating. Therefore, Image B does not depict the field as a floating island.",

      "question": "Are the yellow and red flowers significantly more vibrant and saturated in color compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows yellow and red flowers that appear vibrant. In Image A, the flowers are depicted as vibrant against the green grass, suggesting they're lively. Comparing both images, there is no notable increase in vibrancy or saturation of the flower colors in Image B compared to Image A.",

      "question": "Has the moon been replaced with an oversized apple in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an oversized apple is positioned in the sky, replacing where the moon originally was. This giant apple's prominent presence and its visual placement suggest a deliberate replacement as both have a circular form. Image A shows a moon, indicating that the moon has indeed been replaced by an apple in Image B.",

      "question": "Have the bee and butterfly been replaced with stylized, playful, non-realistic motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bee and butterfly retain realistic forms similar to their depiction in Image A. Both images show these creatures with appropriate shapes such as the wings and body for the butterfly and bee. There is no evidence of stylization or playful modifications in Image B indicating their shift to non-realistic motifs. Thus, the depiction remains consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the tree been replaced with a hollow geometric structure (e.g., cube, pyramid, or sphere) with visible interior or transparent parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is replaced by an oversized apple, which serves as a key feature in the edit. There is no indication of a geometric structure such as a cube, pyramid, or sphere with any visible interiors or transparency as the apple is solid. Image A originally features a tree against the horizon, so in Image B, the change corresponds to the apple, and not a geometric structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the starry night sky with visible stars and cosmic depth is present and continues to be dominant in the background. The visual cues such as the placement of stars and cosmic colors are consistent with Image A, where the sky provides a cosmic backdrop. The presence remains unchanged across both images.",
