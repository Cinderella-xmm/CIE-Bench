      "question": "Has the original pyramid been converted into five adorable chibi-style Russian nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls. These dolls are unrelated to pyramids in structure, shape, or design. The original image depicts a pyramid structure, while the edited image contains dolls, showing a transformation from a single pyramid structure to multiple dolls.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls feature pyramid-inspired designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the dolls have colorful designs with patterns resembling clothing, particularly with diamond-shaped motifs. They do not have any elements that suggest pyramid-inspired designs, like geometric lines resembling steps or triangular shapes typical of a pyramid structure. Therefore, the design of the dolls is independent of pyramid structures.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls arranged in descending size order?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are arranged from left to right, starting with the largest and descending to the smallest. This sequential arrangement is typical for nesting dolls, where they are displayed to show the decreasing size of each subsequent doll. This indicates a clear descending size order.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a set of nesting dolls placed on a flat wooden surface that appears smooth and polished. The grain and finish suggest it is a wooden table. The surface appears neat and well-crafted, which can be described as sophisticated.",

      "question": "Does the edited image have a horizontal 3:2 aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without pixel counting of Image B, it appears rectangular and has greater width than height, suggesting an aspect ratio common to photography such as 3:2. While without detailed pixel count, visually, the image aligns with the 3:2 aspect ratio seen often in such settings.",
