      "question": "Are the patterned surfaces of the handbag replaced with sleek geometric silver and turquoise motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handbag features turquoise color with silver outlines giving a sleek and geometric appearance. The motifs are the Louis Vuitton monogram patterns but enhanced with sharp silver edges that contrast against the turquoise background, providing a modern geometric look. This differs from Image A, where the bag has a traditional brown monogram pattern. Considering these observations, Image B demonstrates the replacement with silver and turquoise motifs.",

      "question": "Do the leather straps feature metallic accents such as silver trim, hardware, or reflective finishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the leather straps do not appear to have any clear metallic accents. While the bag has a metallic finish overall, the straps retain a leather-like appearance without any notable silver trim or reflective finishes. Image A shows similar leather straps without metallic features, confirming that the stylistic change did not extend to metallic accents on the straps in Image B.",

      "question": "Are there intricate machine-age engravings visible along the edges of the handbag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the border of the handbag, particularly the top edge, reveals intricate patterns resembling engravings. These patterns have an industrial or machine-age aesthetic, with a complex, metallic look. Contrasting with Image A, where the edges are plain and simple, the presence in Image B suggests the addition of intricate engravings.",

      "question": "Does the overall design exhibit characteristics of Art Deco style, including geometric symmetry, metallic finishes, and refined elegance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays characteristics typical of Art Deco style. The use of geometric patterns, bold symmetry, and metallic elements contribute to a refined and elegant aesthetic. The turquoise color paired with silver accents exemplifies the luxurious aspects of Art Deco design. Image A lacks these elements, showcasing the contrast with the simple monogram pattern, strengthening the association of Image B with the Art Deco style.",

      "question": "Has the structural form and proportions of the handbag been preserved despite the stylistic changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, both handbags maintain a similar size and shape, with the same pocket placement and structure. The proportions are consistent, indicating that while stylistic changes are evident, they did not alter the fundamental structure or proportions of the bag. Thus, the structural form is preserved across both images despite design modifications.",
