      "question": "Does the image exhibit a soft, watercolor-like texture with blended pastel colors throughout the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are soft and pastel-like, primarily in shades of pink and light blue. These colors give the scene a watercolor and dreamy quality, typical of fantasy illustrations. Additionally, the way colors transition smoothly into one another, combined with soft edges, reinforces the watercolor effect.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there distinct areas of light pink and pale yellow coloration visible on the squirrelâ€™s fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The squirrel in Image B features light pink fur with parts of it shaded to bring out a soft texture. Pale yellow is not prominently visible, but the overall pastel tones accentuate the fantasy element of the depiction. Hence, while pink is distinct, yellow is not highlighted as much.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel indeed has small, delicate wings that resemble those of a fairy or dragonfly, designed with a transparent appearance featuring patterns and colors that align with fantasy themes. This addition transforms the squirrel into a mythical creature within the scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel is shown holding an acorn with a distinct glow, somewhat gem-like, in its hands, but not all acorns are replaced entirely with such objects. Other acorns around it appear more traditional and less modified or replaced.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

However, the exact phrase 'The Jewel Gatherer of Whispering Woods' is either not present or is not clearly legible based on the visual cues due to the stylized font, which is hard to interpret precisely.",
