    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall image framed or designed to resemble a product label with defined edges and layout consistent with a beverage packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of bold, prominent typography, colorful graphics, and structured layout gives the impression of a product label or advertisement. The design features such as the use of vivid colors and text suggest the aesthetics found in beverage packaging design, contributing to a framed look. This indicates a deliberate styling consistent with label design, possibly intended to evoke a sense of energy or refreshment often associated with products like sports drinks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible, stylized streaks of sand in the background that convey motion and act as graphic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features artistic, colorful swirls and streaks that resemble graphic representations of sand or dust. These elements are used to convey a sense of motion and dynamism, typical in designs associated with activities like motocross riding. These streaks are more stylistic in appearance than realistic, indicating a deliberate graphic choice.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the motocross rider depicted as a simplified, high-contrast silhouette with minimal detail, emphasizing form over texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the motocross rider as a simple, high-contrast blue silhouette. This stylization lacks detailed texture or features, emphasizing the form and action over realistic depiction. The choice of a monochrome silhouette is a common design technique to focus on the dynamism and shape rather than intricate detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text \"RaceFuel\" displayed in bold, prominent typography somewhere within the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible text reading \"RaceFuel.\" The visible text includes \"SLEE\" in prominent typography and other graphics, but \"RaceFuel\" specifically does not appear. This suggests an orientation towards different thematic or marketing expressions within the image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a track outline visible in the image, rendered in bright, vivid colors (e.g., red, yellow, blue) and positioned as an overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a track outline in a monochrome grayish-white color near the top of the image. There are bright and vivid colors elsewhere in the image, but the track outline itself is not rendered in varied colors like red, yellow, or blue. Instead, it maintains a simpler color palette, distinct from the vibrant streaks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a speedometer icon located at the bottom of the image, showing a needle pointing to the maximum speed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a speedometer icon at the bottom of the image or anywhere else. The image focuses more on the silhouette, text, and motion graphics above the lower section, negating the presence of a speed-related gauge like a speedometer positioned at the bottom.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the combined visual elements—silhouette, streaks, typography, track, and speedometer—collectively communicate a narrative of power and speed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the image lacks a speedometer, the other elements such as the highly stylized rider silhouette, dynamic sand streaks, bold typography, and track motif contribute to an overall theme of power and speed. Despite the absence of a speedometer, the image successfully creates a narrative centered around energy, movement, and the adrenaline associated with motocross racing. These elements work together to communicate an overarching story of speed and excitement.",
