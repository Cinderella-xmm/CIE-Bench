      "question": "Is the teapot enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is clearly visible under a large transparent cover. The dome shape and transparency suggest it is glass, allowing light to pass through clearly while protecting the teapot from external elements. This is evidenced by the light reflections on the surface of the dome. Therefore, combining visual cues with conceptual knowledge of glass domes leads to the conclusion that the teapot is indeed enclosed within a transparent glass dome.",

      "question": "Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is positioned on a raised base within the glass dome. Although the base appears glossy and has a dark color, there are no distinct reflections of the teapot or other objects, which would typically be visible on a mirrored surface. Thus, combining the visual cues with world knowledge about the appearance and characteristics of mirrored surfaces leads to the conclusion that the base is not reflective as a mirrored base would be.",

      "question": "Are there small porcelain cups arranged in a circle around the base of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows multiple small white cups surrounding the teapot, positioned evenly with equal spacing, forming a circular arrangement around the teapot's base inside the glass dome. These cups match common shapes and colors of porcelain cups. Thus, combining this observation with the understanding of typical arrangements leads to the conclusion that porcelain cups are arranged in a circle around the teapot's base.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there additional tiny, detailed engravings visible on the elevated surfaces of the teapot, amplifying its existing patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot's surface decoration appears intricate with elevated detailing. Observing the ornate engravings on the teapot reveals complex patterns, suggesting enhancements, or amplification of existing designs due to their prominence and detail. Comparing with general knowledge of ornamentation in metalwork, this leads to the conclusion that the teapot features detailed engravings, amplifying its patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible faux steam spirals rising upward from the teapot, forming curved, wispy trails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any visual representations that resemble steam spirals or any elements rising from the teapot. Searching for transparent or wispy trails iconically associated with steam above a teapot finds the area above the teapot devoid of any such feature. Therefore, given the absence of visual cues indicative of steam, the conclusion is that no faux steam spirals are visible.",
