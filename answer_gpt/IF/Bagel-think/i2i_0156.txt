    "Question": "Q1: Do the book pages extend out of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pages of the book are carefully analyzed for any signs of extension beyond the original composition. The visual inspection shows that the book sits entirely within the frame, and no pages appear to be extending beyond it. This is concluded by observing the complete visibility of the book with no interruptions at the edges of the image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a subtle curved shadow on the extended pages?",
    "explanation": "By examining Image B, it is clear there is no existence of extended pages for a shadow to be present. Thus, there cannot be any subtle curved shadow on non-existent extended pages. The shadows present are cast by the natural curvature and placement of the book on the table, rather than by any addition.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the editing convey the impression that the book is unfolding toward the viewer?",
    "explanation": "The evaluation of Image B suggests that the book is open with both pages in view, lying naturally on a surface. The alignment of the book in the image indicates the book is static, with no visual cues implying an active motion of unfolding toward the viewer. The perception of a book unfolding typically would require wider angles or exaggerated curve presentations, which are absent here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the extended pages visually consistent with the original book pages?",
    "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows no indication of visually extended pages from the book. As such, assessing visual consistency between extended and original pages is not possible since there are no observable extensions. The pages seen maintain visual cohesion with the bounds of the physical book.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a seamless transition between the original and extended parts of the book pages?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pages of the book do not exhibit any extended parts, rendering the analysis of a transition between original and extended regions moot. There is no evidence of a transition, seamless or otherwise, because the pages shown are integrally part of the book and confined within the frame.",
    "answer": "No"
