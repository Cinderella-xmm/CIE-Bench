      "question": "Does the character retain the original shell structure and turtle attributes, reimagined in a cute, chibi-style design with long legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character maintains the traditional turtle shell structure and turtle-like features, yet it has been creatively reimagined with a chibi-style form, which is characterized by a larger head and shorter limbs, defying the 'long legs' aspect of the question. The depiction does not include long legs, as they are short and proportionate to a chibi-style character.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the character dressed in stylish designer clothing, wearing small glasses on the head, and carrying a sketchbook or tablet secured behind the shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character in fashionable attire, akin to designer clothing, complete with a blue coat and a golden scarf. However, the character is wearing large round glasses, rather than small ones on the head. It is holding a sign or clipboard that can be interpreted as a sketchpad or document next to its arm, not secured behind the shell.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the character have tiny, chic accessories like a scarf or a small designer bag to complement the look?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can see that the character is accessorized with a scarf, which is often considered a chic accessory. Additionally, there's a depiction of small crafted items like a bag shown beside it, enhancing the character's chic appearance.",

      "question": "Is the background a solid color that harmonizes with the character’s overall color scheme, with no gradients or textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a solid light color, which provides a clean and uncluttered backdrop that complements the character’s design. The absence of gradients or textures in the background aids in focusing the viewer's attention on the character itself.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image have an aspect ratio of 9:16, with \"OOTD\" as top text, the full-body character on the left, and individual clothing pieces/accessories on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does mention 'OOTD' at the top, and it shows the full-body character positioned on the left. However, without the ability to measure the aspect ratio precisely from the given information, it is unclear if it strictly adheres to a 9:16 ratio. Additionally, individual clothing pieces and accessories are shown on the right side, matching the description.",
