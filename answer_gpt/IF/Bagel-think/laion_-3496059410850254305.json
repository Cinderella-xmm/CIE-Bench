      "question": "Has the guitar body been transformed into an armored torso with clear armor-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar body has been stylized with dynamic elements such as illustrative lines that add a sense of motion and energy, but the overall structure and appearance do not resemble an armored torso with armor-like features. The appearance remains more in line with a guitar's form, enhanced with artistic flair rather than transforming into something resembling armor.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the guitar body exhibit a metallic, deep mahogany finish with visible reflective qualities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar body retains a wooden pattern, suggesting a traditional wood finish rather than a metallic surface. There are no significant signs of reflectiveness or metallic appearance evident in the image. Its finish maintains a natural wood texture and does not appear as metallic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are dynamic illustrative lines present around the character to suggest motion or energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are evident dynamic illustrative lines around the guitar, particularly on the edges and extending from the body and headstock. These lines are stylized in blue and black, suggestive of motion or energy, capturing a sense of dynamism and enhancing the visual impact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the guitar strings been transformed into thick, muscle-like strands wrapping around the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the guitar strings in their traditional form without transformation into muscle-like strands or wrap-around features. The strings maintain their linear structure and do not resemble muscle strands or anything akin to wrapping around the guitar body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a luminous cape flowing from the neck with sound wave motifs and a bright emblem on the headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while dynamic lines are present around the guitar, they do not form a cape flowing from the neck; neither are there clear motifs of sound waves nor a bright emblem distinct on the headstock. The embellishments appear to enhance the guitar visually but do not constitute a cape or symbolic emblem as described.",

      "question": "Is the overall shape of the guitar still recognizable, including the headstock, neck, and body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shape of the guitar remains largely recognizable. Despite the added artistic elements, the basic structure of the guitar—including the headstock, neck, and body—is visible and identifiable. The modifications do not obscure the key features that contribute to the guitar’s typical shape.",
