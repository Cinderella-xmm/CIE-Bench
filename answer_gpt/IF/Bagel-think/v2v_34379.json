      "question": "Are the vegetables in the dish visibly smaller than they were in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables appear to have altered shapes and inconsistent coloration, suggesting that they have been resized or distorted in some way. When comparing this with Image A, the vegetables in Image B appear unusual in texture and form, as though they have been shrunken without maintaining their proportionate integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the space between the vegetables increased due to their shrinkage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, it is evident that the vegetables have an altered arrangement, and there appear to be odd shadow effects and overlapping which suggest artificial resizing or manipulation. In Image A, the vegetables are closely packed and orderly laid out. The supposed shrinkage in Image B creates the impression of more space between them.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vegetables maintain their original shapes and colors despite being smaller?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables exhibit a lack of texture, odd blurring, and discoloration. Upon comparison with Image A, where the vegetables display natural colors and textures, it is clear that Image B not only shrank the vegetables but also distorted their shape and changed their color.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the size of the dish holding the vegetables unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows dishes that are consistently the same size as those in Image A. The dimensions of the dishes have not been altered, maintaining the same form and size between the two images. No manipulations to the dish dimensions are apparent between Image A and B.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have any new elements been added or existing elements removed besides shrinking the vegetables?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "A comparison between Image A and B shows that the primary element altered is the resizing and distortion of the vegetables. There are no noticeable additions or removals of other elements within the compositions of the images aside from these alterations.",
