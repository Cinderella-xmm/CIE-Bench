      "question": "Is the entire forest lake scene enclosed within a visible spherical glass orb?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly shown to be inside a spherical structure with a shiny, reflective surface typical of glass, suggesting it is enclosed within a glass orb.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the ducks been replaced with 3D models that have a glossy, reflective surface finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ducks in Image B appear to have a glossy, smooth texture, indicative of 3D models with a reflective finish. This differs from Image A, where the ducks seem more naturally integrated into the scene without such a glossy appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the water with a highly polished, clear appearance, similar to resin art, which suggests layers and transparency that enhance the visual depth, unlike the more natural water of Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are small, stylized figures of animals placed on the scene's edge among rocks, which are distinct from the natural scene in Image A. These figurines appear intentionally crafted and positioned, indicative of miniature decor.",
