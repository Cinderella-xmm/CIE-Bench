      "question": "Has the entire scene been reimagined as a vintage stationery set packaging design rather than a realistic library interior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene depicts a vintage stationery set comprising a decorative box, writing pad, quill, and ink bottle, clearly diverging from the realistic library interior evident in Image A. The visual cues such as the ornate box, packaging design, and the presence of stationery items suggest the transformation from a library to a stationery set packaging. This indicates a shift from a real place to a product design theme.",

      "question": "Is the ornate desk styled as a decorative box base with visible embossed wood textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornate desk from Image A is transformed into a decorative box with intricate designs and a texture that resembles embossed wood. This reflection of design and material suggests a stylized representation based on the original desk structure but in a different context and purpose. It demonstrates the creative adaptation into a packaging design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the open book been replaced with a writing pad made of antique-style paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stack of aged paper on top of the decorative box that bears the characteristics of a writing pad, shifting from the large open book found in Image A. This transformation aligns with the theme of the vintage stationery set, indicating the replacement using antique-style paper for aesthetic consistency in packaging.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the quill depicted as a gold foil embossed logo on the packaging or box surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The quill in Image B appears as an actual physical component of the box set rather than mere decorative embossing or a logo. Hence, based on visual interpretation, the quill remains tangible and not represented as a gold foil embossed logo.",

      "question": "Is there a small ink bottle placed on top of the desk or packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a small ink bottle positioned atop the decorative box, fitting the theme of a vintage stationery set. This addition is a departure from the original image, which lacks such an object on the desk. The presence of the ink bottle is coherent with the setup of a writing package.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are discernible letters and details printed on the writing pad, indicating branding, which contrasts with the book in Image A where specific brand marking is absent. These details contribute to the packaging design by enhancing brand visibility.",
