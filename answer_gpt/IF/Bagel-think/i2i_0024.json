      "question": "Has the person been transformed into a flat illustration-style tennis-themed chibi sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is depicted as a simplified, cartoonish character known as a 'chibi,' which is characterized by an exaggerated and cute aesthetic. This transformation features bold outlines, simplified features, and a focus on creating a playful representation. The use of exaggerated body proportions and a more straightforward design is indicative of a chibi sticker style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the person depicted in the same original pose as in image A?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character's pose with a raised fist is visually similar to the pose in Image A. However, upon closer examination, there are differences in the hand posture and the inclusion of other elements like an additional hand gesture in the sticker. These modifications suggest a different pose or interpretation of the original stance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi sticker retain a red dress and a white hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is indeed depicted wearing a red dress and a white hat, similar to the attire in Image A. The colors and the general style of clothing are maintained, showcasing consistency in the visual theme between the two images.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tennis racket simplified into a black-lined filled shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a tennis racket at all; instead, it features simplified, cartoonish elements like the chibi character and accompanying sticker symbols. The absence of a racket means it cannot be simplified into any shape, black-lined or otherwise.",

    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features two matching stickers, one of a tennis ball and another of a raised finger gesture. However, a sticker with red clay court lines is not present. Only the first two elements are visible, indicating the absence of a comprehensive set of matching stickers.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each sticker, including the chibi character, surrounding hand symbol, and the tennis ball, is outlined with a white border and is set against a transparent background, typical of sticker designs to allow for smooth placement on various surfaces.",
