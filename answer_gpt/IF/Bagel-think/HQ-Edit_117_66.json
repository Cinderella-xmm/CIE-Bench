      "question": "Is the ornate book now represented as a collection of interlocking wooden puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornate book that was present in Image A is now depicted as a framed object without the hinges and spine, giving the appearance of discrete parts within the frame. When combining this visual cue with world knowledge about puzzle pieces, it resembles a set of interlocking wooden sections. This transition from a singular book to a more segmented appearance supports the interpretation of it being a puzzle.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dragon patterns stained with darker wood tones compared to the rest of the puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon patterns in Image B are depicted in a shade that appears slightly deeper than the surrounding areas. Combining visual cues with common knowledge about wood staining, it's reasonable to conclude that the dragon patterns use darker tones to provide contrast.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the compass area rendered in lighter wood tones than the dragon patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the compass area has a color slightly less intense than the darker dragon patterns. By analyzing wood finishes in general, lighter wood tones are often used to subtly highlight without overshadowing darker elements. This observation suggests that the compass is rendered in lighter tones.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wood grain texture clearly visible on the surface of the puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the surfaces of the puzzle-like pieces are smooth but do not exhibit distinct wood grain textures that are immediately visible or pronounced. World knowledge tells us that typical wood grain would be more textured and varied in appearance if significant, leading to the conclusion that these grains are not prominently detailed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all puzzle pieces have smooth, well-defined edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the pieces as having smooth edges without irregularities or distortions. Such characteristics are common in puzzle pieces meant for fitting together neatly. Thus, observations confirm that the edges are indeed well-defined.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the puzzle pieces arranged on a plain, minimalist wooden surface without extraneous items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the scene atop a wooden surface void of additional items that were present in Image A. This minimalist arrangement highlights the puzzle pieces solely against the wood backdrop, adhering to the concept of minimalistic design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the contrasting wood tones sufficient to emphasize the detailed carvings and design elements such as the dragons and compass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the differences in wood tones between the dragon patterns, the compass, and their surroundings are marked clearly enough to accentuate the ornate carvings and overall design. World knowledge of art suggests that such contrasts can enhance the visibility of complex designs.",
