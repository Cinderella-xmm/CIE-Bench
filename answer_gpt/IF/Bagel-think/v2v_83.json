      "question": "Does the skater and skateboard have a 3D cartoon aesthetic with soft lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater and skateboard have a slightly stylized, smooth appearance commonly found in 3D cartoons. The lighting appears soft and even, without harsh shadows, which supports the aesthetic commonly used in 3D cartoon imagery. This suggests a transition from a more realistic depiction to a cartoon-like style.",

      "question": "Are skill stats or bars included on the character card?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the card features certain text elements at the bottom, like 'Bala:', which hints at characteristics or attributes but does not visually represent them as skill stats or bars. A typical character card with skill stats would have numerical values or graphical elements proportionally representing skills.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the card clearly has a title banner at the top with text and a nameplate at the bottom, which is typical of trading or character cards. These elements make the image appear like a card designed to present a character or item.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is altered to feature a series of buildings typical of an urban scene, along with a largely clear sky. This signifies a change from Image A where only a blue sky and clouds are visible. The presence of this urban scenery creates a metropolitan context.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard retains its colorful design with a spectrum of bright, warm, and dynamic colors like orange, yellow, and blue. These colors harmonize with the skater's clothing and the card's background, creating a visually cohesive and vibrant color palette, complementing the dynamic skateboard design.",
