      "question": "Is the edited image divided into two distinct panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are clear lines dividing the content into separate sections that resemble panels. There are two major divisions within the comic strip, suggesting it is split into distinct sections for storytelling.",

      "question": "Is the vape device in Panel 1 rendered in a detailed and realistic manner, showing it in use?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vape device in Panel 1 is rendered in a simple, cartoonish style rather than a detailed, realistic manner. The style is more abstract and illustrative, typical of comic art, rather than photo-realistic, as can be seen in the exaggerated line work and simplified features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text bubbles in Panel 1 contain phrases consistent with comic style dialogue, but none of them include the exact phrase mentioned. They contain similar thematic elements but are phrased differently.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 1 does not feature any background elements that directly depict a laboratory setting. The focus is more on the characters and the device, with no specific elements suggesting innovation or a lab ambiance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 features a cross-section diagram showing parts of the device, but the labels are not clear or legible in identifying specific components like coil, liquid, battery, and airflow. The diagram lacks the clarity or specificity in labeling these parts.",

      "explanation": "The text provided in Panel 2 does not include the exact phrase. It contains text bubbles and expressions but differs in wording from the specified phrase.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is all text in the comic strip rendered in a handwritten-style font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text throughout the comic strip is illustrated in a casual, handwritten-style font typical of comic art, which gives it a personal and informal feel.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparison between Image A and Image B shows that the vape device in the comic strip retains similar visual elements such as a black cap and the concept of transparency, though rendered in a cartoon style. The essential features are present, maintaining a consistent appearance despite stylistic differences.",
