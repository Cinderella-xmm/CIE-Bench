      "question": "Is the image now presented in the context of a museum exhibit corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the dog sculpture is placed inside a glass case typically found in museum exhibits. The presentation environment and lighting further suggest a controlled, formal display akin to those seen in museums. By contrast, Image A depicts a real dog resting on a couch in a domestic setting, which lacks any museum-like attributes.",

      "question": "Is the dog shown inside a glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is clearly inside a glass display case, evident from the glass walls and the lighting setup focusing on the object within the enclosed space. Comparatively, Image A shows an unconfined dog on a couch without any enclosure visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the light focused on the dog's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting emanates from above, typical of museum display cases, which naturally focuses light on the enclosed object, highlighting the main features of the sculpture, including the face. Image A does not feature such focused lighting; instead, it has uniform ambient lighting without specific facial highlighting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a label beneath the dog sculpture. The positioning and style are consistent with informative display labels in museums providing detailed information about the exhibit. Image A lacks any such labels or information displays.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is transformed into a sculpture with notably different characteristics from Image A, which presents a real dog. The sculpture has the same facial pattern but differs in posture and material, signifying a change in appearance. Image A's dog remains organic and lifelike.",
