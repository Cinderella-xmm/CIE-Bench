      "question": "Does the packaging resemble a Funko Pop figure box in design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a box that closely resembles the design of a Funko Pop figure packaging. The box features the familiar Pop! branding style on the top left corner, a graphic representation of the character on the front, and a window allowing visibility of the figure inside. These elements are signature aspects of Funko Pop packaging, which are easily recognizable through common visual knowledge of collectible toys.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text \"HEALING ESSENTIALS\" visible on the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Careful observation of Image B reveals that the text on the packaging includes 'HEMET ANEALIVE' and other stylized representations that resemble text typically, but the specific phrase 'HEALING ESSENTIALS' is not visibly present. This conclusion comes from reading and interpreting the displayed text elements, which do not match the provided phrase.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the packaging illustrated from an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the packaging from a frontal perspective with slight angling that could suggest a three-dimensional view, giving more depth and spatial presence to the box design seen between the window and exterior elements. However, it does not strictly meet the criteria of an isometric perspective, which would involve more geometric angles typically, presenting equal dimensions of depth, height, and width.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bandage inside the packaging have a chibi-style representation with oversized stitching and a cartoonish adhesive area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure inside the packaging in Image B is presented in a chibi style, characterized by exaggerated features such as a small body and oversized head. The bandage-like part of the figure indeed has exaggerated and cartoonish styling, which is consistent with chibi-style aesthetics. Observing these elements aligns with the common design features of chibi-style art, where details like stitching and adhesive patches might be exaggerated for expressive purposes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a realistic version of the bandage displayed outside the packaging, showing intricate details like fabric texture and adhesive surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does depict a bandage outside the packaging, but it is not shown with intricate details such as fabric texture or adhesive surface. The representation outside the box is the same chibi figure, maintaining its stylized, simplified features rather than presenting a realistic view of a bandage with detailed textures. This realization comes from the analysis of the visible elements and assessing them against known realistic textures and details.",
