    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image now an educational infographic with a clear title \"Currencies of the World\" displayed at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title at the top reads 'CAVICURAVIES WITHEAL,' which does not correspond to 'Currencies of the World.' The lettering and arrangement suggest an abstract or unrelated theme, not an educational infographic about global currencies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the design use a clean, modern aesthetic with minimal visual clutter and balanced layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a schematic drawing that gives a somewhat orderly appearance. However, it has random symbols and flags without clear context, suggesting a cluttered design rather than a clean, modern aesthetic. The title and symbols don't align clearly with the concept of minimalism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there distinct labeled sections titled “USD,” “QAR,” and “INR” corresponding to the visible banknotes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include labels such as 'USD,' 'QAR,' or 'INR.' Instead, it features abstract symbols and flags with no clear reference to specific currencies or corresponding banknotes, making it impossible to align these elements with the mentioned currencies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the wallet been replaced with a schematic blueprint-style drawing featuring clean lines and minimalist form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wallet from Image A has been replaced by a schematic representation, which includes lines that resemble a blueprint style. This matches the minimalist form and clean line criteria typical for a schematic drawing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there annotations placed next to each currency slot in the blueprint, identifying or describing the currency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks annotations or text that explicitly identify or describe any currency next to the sections or slots in the schematic drawing. The symbols and flags present aren't clear annotations for currencies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a chart or graph included in the image that displays exchange rate data among USD, QAR, and INR?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no part of Image B that resembles a chart or graph providing exchange rate data or any other financial data involving USD, QAR, and INR. The image lacks structure or elements typically associated with such data presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there icons present that represent the economies of the USA, Qatar, and India respectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains various symbols and flags, but they do not clearly represent icons specific to the economies of the USA, Qatar, and India. The flags and symbols appear arbitrary without depicting specific economic traits or references.",
