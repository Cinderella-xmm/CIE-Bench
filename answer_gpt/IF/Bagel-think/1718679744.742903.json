      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the crocodile depicted with flat, solid color regions and exaggerated features characteristic of pop art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile is illustrated using flat, solid color areas devoid of gradient or textural shading typical of realistic representations. The exaggerated colors and the stylization of traits such as the vibrant sunglasses and hat fit well within the pop art aesthetic. This genre is known for its bold outlines, vivid color palette, and simplified forms, emphasizing graphic elements over realistic detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the edges of the crocodile, hat, and sunglasses defined by bold, continuous black outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each element, including the crocodile body, its scales, the hat, and sunglasses, are characterized by strong, unbroken black lines. These outlines delineate each feature clearly against one another and the background, consistent with graphic or cartoon styling rather than photo-realistic detail, which rarely uses pure black outlines.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the hat and sunglasses rendered in highly saturated, vivid neon colors (e.g., electric pink, lime green, hot orange)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the crocodile adorned in a hat and sunglasses colored with intense and bright hues like electric pink and neon yellow, creating a striking, eye-catching contrast typical in the use of neon colors. These colors are beyond naturalistic tones and lean towards the artificial saturation often associated with pop art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the crocodile’s scales been replaced with a consistent, repeating geometric pattern (e.g., squares, rectangles, or dots)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details of the crocodile’s scales are presented as a consistent and repetitive geometric pattern that encompasses the entire body. Each section follows a clear, even distribution of shapes, differing from a naturalistic texture with a variety of scales differing in size and shape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit high color contrast between the crocodile, hat, sunglasses, and background, with minimal shading and a stylized, graphic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features high contrasting colors where the bright neon-toned accessories stand out starkly against both the crocodile and the flat, solid-colored background. The absence of detailed shading contributes to a graphic, stylized representation consistent with minimalistic and bold pop-art illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the crocodile still in the same pose and position as in the original image, with the hat on its head and sunglasses over its eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing both images, it can be seen that the pose and position of the crocodile in Image B remain identical to those seen in Image A. The hat remains on its head, and the sunglasses rest over its eyes in the same manner, despite the alterations in artistic style and color schemes.",
