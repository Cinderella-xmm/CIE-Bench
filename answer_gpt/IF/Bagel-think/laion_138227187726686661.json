    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bedspread composed of multicolored LEGO-style blocks arranged in a patchwork pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bedspread clearly shows a design that mimics LEGO-style blocks. The blocks are visible as small, interconnected pieces that form the surface of the bedspread, reminiscent of a patchwork pattern through the arrangement of multiple colors. This appearance differs from the typical fabric texture, suggesting the design mimics a LEGO-block aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sports balls on the quilt represented by circular arrangements of LEGO-style tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sports balls do not appear to be represented by any specific circular arrangements of tiles. Instead, the entire bedspread is made of LEGO-style blocks without any discernible ball shapes. Therefore, there are no clear representations of sports balls seen as individual or circular arrangements on the quilt.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the pillow been replaced with a cube-shaped object constructed from stacked LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pillow in Image B appears as a structure formed from multicolored LEGO-style bricks, giving it a blocky, rectangular appearance. This contrasts with a conventional pillow which would typically be soft and fabric-covered. Thus, it matches the description of a cube-shaped object made from LEGO bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bed resting on a plain white surface with a visible LEGO baseplate texture (grid of raised studs)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the bed shows a pattern that resembles a LEGO baseplate texture, characterized by a grid of raised studs. This suggests the base is styled to imitate the look of a LEGO base, rather than a plain white surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire background of the image a smooth, uninterrupted white surface with no visible walls, windows, or furniture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is not entirely a smooth white surface; the left side of the room, including a blue wall, a lamp, and a framed picture, is clearly visible. The transformation to LEGO-style elements is mainly applied to the bed area, so the rest of the environment remains untouched.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bed frame or mattress appear to be constructed from LEGO bricks or styled to resemble LEGO material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No (unless explicitly stated; default assumption is only the baseplate is LEGO)",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the bedding and pillow have been transformed into LEGO-style creations, the bed frame itself remains as the original black wooden structure seen in Image A. Therefore, the frame has not been altered to appear as though made from LEGO bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any non-LEGO objects such as a real soccer ball, lamp, or framed picture present in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B still contains visible non-LEGO elements, such as the lamp on the nightstand, the framed picture on the wall, and other furnishings that are not transformed into a LEGO format, much like in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
