      "question": "Are the stickers arranged in a neat 3x3 grid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are nine individual sticker illustrations shown, and they are positioned in 3 rows with 3 stickers each, creating a structured 3x3 grid layout. A grid is often a pattern of regularly spaced horizontal and vertical lines that create a series of square or rectangular modules.",

      "question": "Is the background of the stickers transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stickers are shown with a white background surrounding each character. Typically, in digital sticker sheets prepared for printing or display, transparency is depicted by a checkerboard pattern, which is not visible here. Instead, each sticker has a visible solid white background.",

      "question": "Do all stickers maintain a square, 1:1 aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each sticker in Image B appears as a rectangular shape, not a perfect square. A 1:1 aspect ratio means that the height and width are equal, forming a square. However, due to the visible white outline around each sticker illustration, none of these stickers have equal sides.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stickers each depict different actions and emotions. For example, some stickers show activities like painting, eating, or thinking, with corresponding emotional expressions like happiness, contemplation, or excitement. These features reflect various themes associated with artistic moods.",

      "question": "Is there a uniform white outline around each sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each sticker in Image B has a consistent white border encasing the illustration, providing a uniform outline. This is a common stylistic choice for stickers, creating visual separation from other elements when they are cut out or applied to surfaces.",
