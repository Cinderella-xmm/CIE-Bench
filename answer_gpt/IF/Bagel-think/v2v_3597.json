      "question": "Has the contemporary shed been replaced with a vintage wooden washtub?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the washing apparatus used by the woman is a vintage wooden washtub with no mechanical components visible. Given the design and material, it's clear that the washtub is traditional. In comparison, Image A depicts a similar washtub, more detailed with mechanical components like gears, which suggests a more contemporary design. The visual cues in Image B omit these mechanical parts, focusing on a more rustic design.",

      "question": "Are the surrounding plants and lighting unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible plant next to the washtub in the background. In contrast, Image A does not display this plant in the same position. This addition or alteration suggests a change in the surroundings. Therefore, given the visual cues, the surroundings have been modified from Image A to Image B.",

      "question": "Is the washtub depicted as vintage and made of wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features a wooden washtub, which is consistent with a vintage style. This is derived from its traditional barrel-like shape, wooden texture, and absence of modern mechanical features that would suggest a contemporary design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is an additional plant next to the woman that was not present in Image A. This indicates that new plants have been added to the scenery in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The consistent sepia tone and shading between Image A and Image B suggest that lighting remained largely unchanged. Both images share a similar old-style illustration appearance with even lighting and shadows, indicating no discernible changes in lighting.",
