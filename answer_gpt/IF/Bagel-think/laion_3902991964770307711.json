      "question": "Are the three top portions of the candelabra replaced with transparent, tapered glass perfume caps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top portions of the candelabra appear to be cylindrical and metallic, not transparent or resembling glass perfume caps. Typically, glass objects are highly reflective and have a smooth texture, whereas the visual appearance here is consistent with metal. Therefore, based on visual observation combined with knowledge of material characteristics, the answer is: No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the curved arms connecting the top portions are indeed sleek and have a seamless appearance with a gold finish, which is clearly visible and distinct from standard metallic finishes. This conclusion is drawn by combining visual cues such as the uniform shine and smooth texture, which indicate a high-quality, finished metallic surface. Therefore, the answer is: Yes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the object in Image B is visible and has an intricate floral pattern, but no visible minimalist brand logo is present.
