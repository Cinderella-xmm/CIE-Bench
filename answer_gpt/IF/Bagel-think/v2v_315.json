      "question": "Has the woman been converted into an adorable 3D chibi-style character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character has more stylized features, including a larger head and a smaller body, which are common traits of a 3D chibi-style character. This is a transformation from the original, more realistically proportioned character in Image A. The change in style is evident from the exaggerated proportions and cartoonish appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the character posing confidently in front of the echidna?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character stands with hands on the hips and a forward stance, which are visual cues suggesting a confident pose. This mirrors common confident body language, showing self-assuredness. When compared to Image A, the pose remains similarly confident.",

      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Is the environment still realistic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment has shifted to a more toy-like, stylized background reflecting the 3D chibi aesthetic. The soft colors and simplified shapes contribute to a non-realistic appearance. Therefore, the environment is not realistic, changing from Image A where it was more surreal but still somewhat natural in color and form.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the warm, golden hues of the surreal landscape preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the warm, golden hues that were present in Image A. Despite the change in style to a chibi and less realistic environment, the color palette continues to reflect the original warm tones, maintaining an element of visual consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Does the character retain her confident pose while being in a 3D chibi style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the transformation into a 3D chibi character in Image B, the pose remains unchanged with hands on hips and a forward stance, indicative of confidence. This retains the character's original positioning from Image A even within the altered art style.",
