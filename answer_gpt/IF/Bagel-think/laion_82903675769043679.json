      "question": "Has the English manor-style house been replaced with a structure composed of fragmented, colorful geometric planes consistent with cubist art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure previously identified as an English manor-style house is no longer recognizable in its traditional form. Instead, it has been transformed into a series of colorful, geometric shapes that are characteristic of cubist art. This involves the use of different shapes, lines, and colors that convey a sense of abstract and fragmented form, which diverges from realistic representation into a more imaginative interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original brick surfaces of the house replaced with vibrant, non-uniform geometric planes rather than realistic masonry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual analysis of Image B indicates that the surfaces that would correspond to brickwork are now filled with colorful and non-uniform geometric shapes. These planes replace the traditional detail and texture associated with brick masonry with an abstract composition, devoid of realistic texture or uniformity, reinforcing a complete stylistic shift away from realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all individuals in the crowd been rendered as abstract, faceless, and scattered forms devoid of detailed features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the forms representing individuals are depicted as simplistic, abstract shapes lacking in detail such as facial features or clothing outlines. They stand in stark contrast to Image A where the crowd is realistic with distinguishable human characteristics, indicating they have been transformed into abstract, indistinct representations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the grass surface feature a visible checkered pattern overlaying the entire green area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On observing Image B, the grassy area does not exhibit a checkered pattern in the conventional sense. Instead, the areas typically comprising grass are transformed into varied geometric shapes and patterns differing from the traditional smooth expanse of green seen in Image A. Thus, no specific repetitive checkered pattern overlay is discernible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the water reflection been transformed into a series of prismatic, angular shards that distort and fragment the image of the house and surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection in Image B is a series of fragmented and colorful angular shapes that diverge from the smooth, coherent reflection seen in Image A. This indicates the presence of prismatic angles which distort the visuals of what would have been a clear reflection, corresponding to an abstract or artistic reinterpretation.",
