      "question": "Does the edited image show a single humanoid figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there is a humanoid figure appearing from within the fur of the cow, which is identified by its facial features superimposed onto the cow's body. However, there is also another human visible on the left guiding the cow, indicating that multiple figures are depicted in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cow's horns are prominently visible extending above the cow's head in the edited image (Image B). The humanoid figure's face is edited onto the cow's body, but the horns remain part of the cow's original structure.",

      "question": "Does the humanoid figure have fur resembling that of a cow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) has a humanoid face inserted into the area of the cow's body that is covered in fur. Therefore, the humanoid figure appears to be enclosed within the cow's body and thus surrounded by its fur.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original clothing is worn by the man who is guiding the cow in the image, visible on the left side. The humanoid figure, instead, is overlaid onto the cow's face within its fur, so it does not have any clothing of its own.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The man’s posture includes standing upright and holding the rope, while the humanoid figure inserted into the cow's body is simply a face inserted into the cow’s fur, without any posture or stance of its own.",
