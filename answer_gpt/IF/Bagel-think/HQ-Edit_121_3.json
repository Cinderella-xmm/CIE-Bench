      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the butterfly been transformed into a creature that visually resembles a floral being, with no recognizable insectoid body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature on the flower appears to have wings that resemble leaf and petal structures, and the body is transformed to look like elements of a flower rather than a typical insect's segmented body. This visual transformation suggests a shift from insectoid to more florally influenced design, with no recognizable insect body parts. Analysis of how the wings and body are depicted shows an emphasis on floral features, combining the leaf-like wings and a petal-like form in place of a segmented insect body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wings appear folded into distinct, vibrant petal-like structures instead of flat, membranous insect wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are designed to look like layered, petal-like structures, deviating from the flat, membranous form typical of insect wings. The visual design of the wings incorporates vibrant colors and rounded, layered shapes that are more akin to flower petals. The depiction uses visual cues like color and texture which help make the wings appear floral rather than membranous.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the butterfly's body now resemble a thin, upright flower stalk rather than an insectâ€™s segmented torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, the body of the creature looks more like it is part of a flower with a central stalk-like element rather than resembling the segmented body typical of an insect. The image suggests a transformation where the central body mimics the stem or elongated central part of a flower, reinforced by its thinness and alignment with the petal-like wings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original wing patterns replaced with detailed, naturalistic leaf designs across the entire surface of the wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B feature designs that visually mimic leaves with veins and curved forms, distinctly different from the symmetrical patterns typical of insect wings. The entirety of the wings is crafted to appear like integrated leaf structures, indicating a transformation from the original patterned wings. The presence of visually distinct leaf elements replaces any prior insect patterning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible tendril-like structures extending from the tips of the butterfly's antennae?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the antennae have forms that suggest tendril-like extensions, different from standard linear insect antennae. Tendril-like structures can be recognized by their curled or spiral shapes, often resembling plant tendrils. The depiction in Image B includes these characteristics, notably enhanced by the overall floral transformation of the creature.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small blossoms visibly attached to the edges of the wings and at the foot/lowest part of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outer portions of the wings exhibit floral characteristics, such as small blossom-like protrusions. Additionally, the lower section or foot area of the creature shows similar floral appendages, aligning with the transformed floral theme noted in other parts of the image.",

      "question": "Is the background identical to the original image, featuring the same meadow with pink coneflowers, golden grasses, and blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B share the same background elements: a meadow with pink coneflowers, golden grasses, and a blue sky. The background has not been altered between the two images. The floral field scene remains consistent in layout, flora, and color, confirming the visual symmetry between them.",
