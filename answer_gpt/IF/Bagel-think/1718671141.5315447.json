      "question": "Does the building now feature visible brass gears integrated into its exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are multiple visible gears integrated into the exterior of the building. These gears are prominently in brass color, occupying significant parts of the building’s facade. World knowledge indicates that gears are associated with mechanical designs often seen in steampunk-style architectures, and they are distinct elements in Image B not originally present in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there copper-colored funnel-shaped structures present on the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are several structures visible that resemble funnels or pipes, and they are distinctly copper-colored, fitting with the steampunk aesthetic. These are clearly attached to the building and are visible towards the top and along the sides of the structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the original glass dome been replaced with a dome featuring intricate metalwork patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original glass dome from Image A has been transformed in Image B to include intricate metalwork elements. The dome loses the smooth glass appearance and instead showcases metal patterns, aligning with the mechanical and gear themes present throughout Image B.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the moon in the sky replaced by one or more giant clock faces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon remains in the sky, but giant clock faces are integrated into the building’s design. The clocks themselves are part of the building’s structure, and although they introduce a new element to the scene, they do not replace the moon.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are rivets visibly present on the clock faces and/or the building's exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Close inspection of Image B reveals that rivets are visibly present on both the clock faces and various parts of the building's exterior. This supports the steampunk-inspired transformation, where rivets are commonly used in constructions to emphasize a mechanical, industrial design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there visible steam or vapor emitting from parts of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the steampunk transformation, there is no visible steam or vapor emitting from any parts of the building. The transformation includes gears, clocks, and metallic structures, but no steam or vapor effects are depicted in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the reflection of the transformed building clearly visible in the water below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection of the transformed building in Image B is clearly visible in the water below. This is consistent with the positioning and clarity of the reflection observed in Image A, although the reflected content is different due to the transformation.",
