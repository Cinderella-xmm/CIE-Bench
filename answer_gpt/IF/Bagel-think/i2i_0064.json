      "question": "Has the cat been fitted with glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is visibly wearing glasses. This is evident from the additional frames over the cat's eyes, which is not typical for cats and suggests digital editing to create a humorous or anthropomorphized appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is positioned in a relaxed manner, sitting back on a sofa with its limbs positioned in a way that mimics a human lounging. This unusual posture for a cat indicates an intentional edit to create a humorous effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat holding a remote control, suggesting an anthropomorphic alteration. Additionally, a television is visible in the background, not distinctly in the foreground, but enough to suggest the presence of the TV and the setting of a living room.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B depicts elements typically found in a living room, such as a TV, windows, and home decor. This setting replaces what could have previously been a different background, suggesting a deliberate change to evoke a domestic scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat maintains its fur pattern and the red bell collar is visible, indicating some aspects of its original form have been preserved. However, the posture has changed significantly to a more human-like position, reflecting an alteration in at least its posture due to digital editing.",
