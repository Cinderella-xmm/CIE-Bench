    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire bottle constructed entirely from LEGO bricks, with no realistic glass or plastic elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle appears to be constructed entirely from LEGO bricks. The visual cues suggest that the structure is made from interlocking LEGO pieces, giving it a blocky, constructed appearance without any elements that resemble realistic glass or plastic. Common sense indicates that LEGO constructions would replace typical materials with their signature bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the body and sides of the bottle built using translucent green LEGO bricks?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the bottle with a translucent green appearance, resembling translucent LEGO bricks. The visual effect hints at the translucent nature typical of LEGO pieces, combining a familiar green shade seen in LEGO sets. The image shows consistent translucency and green color, aligning with common LEGO brick aesthetics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the label area composed of multicolored LEGO blocks representing the original design elements (logo, text, colors)?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the label area features traditional design elements like logos and text directly printed onto the bottle and not represented through LEGO blocks. The brand elements are consistent with normal labels printed on commercial products, rather than constructed from LEGO bricks, hence not indicative of multicolored blocks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the cap made from smooth, circular blue LEGO bricks and does it maintain a cylindrical shape?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the cap as smooth and blue, resembling LEGO brick texture, typically cylindrical as expected for bottle caps. It maintains a cylindrical shape aligned with LEGO constructs, where pieces form predictable shapes like cylinders when stacked appropriately.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO bottle placed on a minimalist white shelf against a neutral or white background?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO bottle clearly resting on a white surface that appears to be a shelf against a neutral background. This setting suggests a minimalist design often associated with simple shelving units, allowing focus on the bottle itself.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all brand texts (e.g., 'Bacardi,' 'Mojito,' 'Classic Cocktails') visibly rendered in blocky LEGO-style lettering and legible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brand texts like 'Bacardi' and 'Mojito' are legible and maintain the original lettering style, printed directly onto the bottle as seen on typical product labels. They are not represented in the blocky lettering style of LEGO bricks. Therefore, the text is not in LEGO-style lettering.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the LEGO bottle display clear sculptural features such as defined edges, depth, and 3D form to emphasize its construction?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays distinct sculptural features, showcasing defined edges, depth, and a 3D form typical of LEGO construction. These elements emphasize the constructed nature, with familiar LEGO characteristics present, such as interlocking bricks forming the bottle's structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
