        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sidewalk appears to be covered in white flakes. This visual cue combined with world knowledge suggests that the ground could be covered in snow, as snow manifests as flaky, white material, typically seen in winter conditions.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the radish character is wearing a scarf, visibly wrapped around its neck. No hat is visible on the character. World knowledge tells us that scarves are commonly worn in colder, winter weather to keep warm.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is not visually depicted wearing anything resembling a winter jacket over its body. It retains the same appearance as in warmer conditions. Therefore, based on observation, the dog is not dressed in a winter jacket.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains several winter-themed elements: snow-covered ground, falling snowflakes, and the radish character wearing a scarfâ€”all typical indicators of a winter scene. Combining these visual and thematic cues with world knowledge about winter landscapes suggests that the scene represents a winter landscape.",
