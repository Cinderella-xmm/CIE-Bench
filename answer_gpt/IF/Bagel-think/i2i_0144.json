      "question": "Has a small flag reading “Fresh” been added on top of the sandwich?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual inspection shows a small flag with the word 'Fresh' written on it inserted on top of the sandwich. The presence of this flag is a distinct addition that is not part of typical sandwich components. Common sense tells us that such flags are often used for decoration or to convey a message. Therefore, the conclusion drawn from these observations is that the flag is indeed newly added.",

      "question": "Have the tomato slices been replaced with grilled pineapple slices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows slices that have the visual characteristics of pineapple, distinguished by a lighter color and potential grill marks. Furthermore, pineapples often have a texture and appearance that differs from tomatoes, as seen here. In Image A, there were red tomato slices present. Therefore, the slices in Image B are indeed a replacement of tomatoes with grilled pineapple slices.",

      "question": "Are the layers of lettuce and meat unchanged except for the addition of the flag and substitution of the tomato?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the lettuce and meat retain a similar appearance in terms of arrangement and quantity to what is typically expected in a sandwich, matching the layers in Image A with consistency in color and texture. Therefore, except for the noted changes (the flag and substitution), these components remain unchanged.",

      "question": "Do the pineapple slices appear grilled, showing char marks or a browned exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows pineapple slices that exhibit typical grilling characteristics, such as noticeable char marks, usually appearing as browned lines on the pineapple surface. Grilling often imparts these visual cues. Using world knowledge about grilling effects, the conclusion can be drawn that these slices are indeed grilled.",

      "question": "Does the flag sit properly on top of the sandwich without disrupting its composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flag is positioned on top of the sandwich in a manner that doesn't appear to alter the overall structure significantly. It seems neatly placed and does not affect the balance of the sandwich layers. Given the placement and its function as a decorative piece, the flag is appropriately seated without disrupting the sandwich's composition.",
