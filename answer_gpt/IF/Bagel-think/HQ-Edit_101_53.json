    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pug depicted as a carved wooden sculpture rather than a living dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a pug that has been transformed into a sculpture with a distinct, glossy wooden texture. The visual cues such as the uniform wood grain texture, polished surface, and sculpted appearance indicate that it is not a living dog, but a carved representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the fur been replaced with smooth, polished wood grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original texture of animal fur is typically soft and varied, while in Image B, the pug's 'fur' is represented by a smooth, polished wood grain texture. This is evident from the consistent lines and shine associated with wood polishing, indicating a crafted, not natural, texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors of the sculpture consistent with walnut tones, maintaining the original pug's color pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sculpture in rich brown and black tones typical of walnut wood. These colors appear to mimic the color pattern of a pug, with the darker areas corresponding to the pug's face and lighter brown for the body.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and features represented by etched or carved lines rather than soft skin folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pug's facial features are highlighted by carved lines that create the illusion of wrinkles, as opposed to the soft, pliable skin wrinkles of a real pug. This method is typical for capturing detail in wood sculptures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden pug placed on a simple black base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B is a simple black circular platform, providing a clear distinction between the pug sculpture and the supporting surface. This base contrasts with the wooden sculpture, suggesting a display or decorative purpose.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the black base provide a stark contrast to the rich wood texture of the sculpture, emphasizing its craftsmanship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black base in Image B contrasts with the lighter and warmer tones of the wood grain, helping to highlight the detailed craftsmanship and the overall form of the sculpture. This visual contrast is common in such displays to draw attention to the art piece itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
