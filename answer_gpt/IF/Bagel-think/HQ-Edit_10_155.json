      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the ornate lantern enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lantern stands freely on top of a surface, and there is no visible transparent glass dome enclosing it. The visual cues show the lantern directly sitting on a table-like structure without any cover, which suggests that it is not enclosed within a glass dome.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the original tile designs been replaced with scaled-down, vibrant ceramic street pavements forming a ground surface beneath the lantern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the lantern is transformed into a miniature scene resembling a tiled ground. The large mosaic pattern in Image A is replaced with smaller square tiles depicted as part of a street scene, indicating the change to vibrant ceramic street pavements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small textile merchants with colorful fabric canopies positioned around the base of the lantern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe small market stalls with colorful fabric canopies surrounding the base of the lantern, resembling textile merchants that are commonly seen in marketplaces or bazaars. The existence of these stalls with canopies around the lantern clearly indicates their presence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there tiny palm trees integrated into the scene around the base of the lantern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed tiny palm trees visible around the base of the lantern. These small trees contribute to creating a market or street scene atmosphere, often associated with warm, exotic locations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base of the glass dome feature a weathered, rustic town square surface with aged textures and irregular patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base is not enclosed by a glass dome and doesn't exhibit a weathered, rustic square appearance with aged textures. Rather, it's a tiled pavement street scene element, and lacks the qualities of being weathered or rustic with aging effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the entire scene composed of a coherent miniature medina environment with all specified elements (glass dome, ceramic pavements, merchants, palm trees, rustic base) arranged to create an exotic and charming atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While many elements such as ceramic pavements, merchants, and palm trees are present, there's no glass dome and the base isn't rustic. The scene is indeed miniature and exotic with an exotic market atmosphere, but not entirely with all specified elements involved.",
