      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bear that is depicted in a cartoonish and stylized manner with exaggerated features, such as large eyes and a more rounded shape. The fur is represented with simple lines rather than intricate, realistic details. This style is common in animated or chibi character designs, which prioritize a simplified and cute appearance over realistic details.",

      "question": "Does the bear figure have emotive eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear has large, exaggerated eyes that are characteristic of cartoon or anime styles, often designed to convey emotions effectively. The large eyes have a shiny appearance, which is typically used to illustrate a range of emotions in animated characters, making them feel more expressive.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bear figure resting on a wooden surface that resembles a desk or tabletop commonly found in indoor settings. The surrounding environment, including blurred background elements like a computer, suggests an office or study room setting, reinforcing the likelihood of a desk.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack is designed to match the cartoonish style of the bear figure. It lacks the realistic textures and details such as visible zippers or fabric textures one would expect in a scaled-down realistic model. Instead, it shares the simplified and stylized design that aligns with the bear's chibi style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a distinct stylized and animated look, not a natural or casual vibe that would be captured by a smartphone in a real-life setting. The entire scene is crafted intentionally for an animated or cartoon-like effect, lacking the nuances of lighting and detail that a casual photo might exhibit.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a bear figure that strictly adheres to Japanese anime or chibi style, which emphasizes simplicity and cuteness over realistic textures. The bear's design in Image B consists of large eyes, smooth surfaces, and simplified features, lacking the textured detail that would characterize lifelike renditions.",
