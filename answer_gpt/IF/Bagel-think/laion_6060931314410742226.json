      "question": "Is the rose bush rendered as a mosaic mural composed of distinct tile-like segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rose bushes appear to be digitally edited to resemble a mosaic style, where the flowers and leaves are divided into smaller segments like tiles. This can be inferred from the visible partitioning and a repetitive pattern reminiscent of mosaic art. The individual elements within the bush are distinctly sectioned, supporting the notion of a mosaic mural.",

      "question": "Are all flowers outlined with bold, distinct borders resembling ceramic tile edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers have outlines that are visually bold and prominent, mimicking the edges seen in ceramic tiles. These borders distinctly separate each flower from its neighbor, giving the impression of tiles arranged in a pattern. This stylistic choice enhances the perception of the mosaic effect, differentiating it from the smooth outlines typical of real flowers.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the petals and leaves depicted in shades of pearl (soft white/off-white) and jade (greenish tones), replacing their original colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the petals and leaves in altered hues. The petals show shades of soft white and creamy tones akin to pearl, while the leaves adopt rich turquoise and greenish tones resembling jade. This is a departure from natural flower coloring and is achieved through color manipulation, supporting a more stylized visual impression.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the red brick building been abstracted using terracotta tile shades (warm earthy tones) instead of realistic red bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building's facade is depicted using warm earthy tones that suggest terracotta tiling. This alteration renders the bricks in a stylized form, deviating from the original realistic red brick appearance seen in Image A. The color scheme is more uniform and artistic, resembling terracotta shades used in various ceramic artworks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are architectural features of the building (such as arches or window frames) incorporated into the mosaic pattern as stylized elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The architectural features in Image B, such as arches and window frames, are visually adapted within the mosaic artwork. These elements pop out as stylized, maintaining their form but aligning with the mosaic theme applied across the whole image. The effect is a unified pattern where architectural intricacies are included within the mosaic, displaying a creative and artistic rendition.",
