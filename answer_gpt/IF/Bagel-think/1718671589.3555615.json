        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dome in Image B appears rounded and is light brown, matching the hue and gloss typically associated with a cinnamon sugar glaze.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows and doors of the building are outlined with white detailing that resembles decorative icing patterns seen on gingerbread houses.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are depicted as bright, orange-brown structures with a shiny appearance. This suggests they are designed to look like candy sculptures, as the texture and tone resemble candied elements with sugar coatings. Such detailing is not typical of natural trees, indicating they were replaced with artistic candy representations.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base on which the structure and surrounding elements stand is distinctly white with grey vein-like patterns typical of marble. The perfectly polished look matches the description of a marble slab, differing from any natural ground. Such a structured pedestal is typical in the presentation of decorative edible architecture.",
