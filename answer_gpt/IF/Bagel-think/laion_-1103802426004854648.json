      "question": "Is the seahorse made entirely of glass material instead of plush fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, the texture of the seahorse appears smooth and shiny, resembling glass rather than plush fabric, which typically has a soft, matte appearance. The visual cues indicate it is meant to have a glass-like material. However, the shape and features are consistent with a seahorse toy usually made of fabric.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the body of the seahorse have a translucent pink glass appearance with visible subtle bubble textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the seahorse with a whitish appearance rather than translucent pink glass. The visual cues of subtle bubble textures typical of blown glass are not evident. Instead, the surface appears to be uniformly colored, suggesting a smooth finish without the texture or transparency associated with glass.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the belly section made of opaque yellow glass with an etched music note design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual cues in Image B indicate that the belly is shiny and smooth, suggesting a glass-like appearance. The music note design appears to be part of the surface, which aligns with the characteristics of something etched on glass. Thus, the belly has qualities typical of opaque yellow glass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ribbons on the head and fins made of lavender-colored glass instead of fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ribbons retain their detailed folds and texture indicative of fabric, although they have a sheen that could be interpreted as glass. Considering common characteristics of glass objects, the fabric-like appearance suggests they are not altered to look like glass.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly shows the seahorse positioned on a black base with a glossy finish, typical of display stands intended for showcasing collectible or decorative items, reflecting light, which indicates a reflective surface.",
