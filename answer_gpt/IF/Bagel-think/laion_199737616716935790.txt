    "Question": "Q1: Is the motorcycle composed entirely of black and blue LEGO-style bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is built entirely using black and blue LEGO-style bricks. The visual cues are clear as every component of the motorcycle, including the body, seat, and wheels are made up of these colorful bricks without any other color visible. This aligns with a design choice to stick to a two-tone scheme often seen in LEGO models.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the LEGO model retain the angular design features of the original motorcycle?",
    "explanation": "The motorcycle in Image B is constructed using LEGO-style bricks, which inherently produce angular shapes due to the rectangular and squared nature of the bricks. These bricks allow the creation of geometric and angular designs, resembling the style of the motorcycle in Image A, though limited by the blocky LEGO design. Thus, the fundamental angularity is retained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the wheel rims replaced with intricate cog patterns typical of LEGO mechanical parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wheel rims of the LEGO motorcycle have a detailed pattern which resembles a cog or gear-like design, commonly found in LEGO sets that include mechanical aspects or moving parts. This intricate design stands out compared to typical plain LEGO wheels, indicating a specialized piece was used.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the original decals represented as colorful printed tiles on the LEGO model?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle lacks the original decals found in Image A, which would be represented as colorful printed tiles if converted to a LEGO model. The LEGO version focuses only on using plain blue and black bricks without any detailed printing or decals. Thus, the original decals are not represented in the LEGO version.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO model placed on a smooth gray baseplate with directional arrows?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the LEGO motorcycle resting on a smooth gray baseplate. There are visible white arrows printed on the baseplate on either side of the model. The arrows suggest it is possibly part of a display feature, enhancing the presentation of the model in a specific direction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the blue and black stripes follow the same dynamic flow and positioning as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blue and black pattern formed by the LEGO bricks does not follow the exact dynamic flow and positioning as seen in the original motorcycle in Image A. In a LEGO model, especially due to the constraints of brick shapes, replicating the precise curves and flows of decals is challenging. As such, while blue and black colors are used, their flow and placement differ.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the LEGO model displayed within a clean, enclosed display case?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO motorcycle model enclosed within a clear display case. The case appears clean and serves to protect the model while also allowing for unobstructed viewing from all angles. This is a common practice for showcasing detailed or valuable LEGO models, ensuring they are well-preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"
