      "question": "Is the dancer depicted in a 3D chibi-style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual characteristics that signify a 3D chibi-style include exaggeratedly large head and eyes, with small body dimensions typical of this style. The figure's proportions and simplified features align well with common representations of chibi artwork, which often aim for a playful and exaggerated cute aesthetic combined with 3D modeling techniques.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dancer frozen mid-pose, accurately capturing their graceful movements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the dancer in a static position that resembles a ballet pose. The raised leg and the extended arm suggest motion even while being static, a common technique in art and animation to imply elegance and fluidity. While not in motion because itâ€™s a single frame, the depiction does suggest a snapshot of a graceful ballet move.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dancer positioned stepping through a glowing elliptical portal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the dancer standing within a glowing structure that resembles a portal. The elliptical shape and the manner in which the dancer is integrated with the background visually imply movement through this space, suggesting interaction with a portal-like element.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the portal's framework feature radiant hues of blue and purple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portal surrounding the dancer clearly exhibits a gradient of blue and purple hues, contributing to a radiant effect. These vibrant colors are visually discernible and suggest the stylistic intention to create a magical or futuristic atmosphere.",

      "question": "Is the dancer extending their hand toward the viewer in a welcoming gesture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is depicted with an arm extended forward with fingers pointing outward, which can be interpreted as a welcoming and engaging gesture toward the viewer, conveying a sense of invitation or outreach commonly used to interact with the audience.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the composition of Image B, its rectangular shape does not clearly fall within the 2:3 aspect ratio on visual inspection alone. This type of ratio typically requires specific measurements; based purely on visible proportions, the ratio seems closer to a square or alternative ratio.",
