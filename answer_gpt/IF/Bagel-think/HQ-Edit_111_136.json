      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animals in the background appear to be realistic savannah wildlife, specifically antelope, rather than mythical creatures like griffins, centaurs, or sphinxes. This preserves the connection to an African landscape rather than a mythical setting.",

The cloud formation remains more natural, matching that of a realistic sky.",
