      "question": "Are the four figures transformed into fish-shaped forms with visible fins and tails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are four fish-shaped items, each with distinctive fish features such as fins and tails. These features are prominent and visible on each figure, indicating a transformation into fish-shaped forms. The visual cues of fins and tails on each item in Image B clearly show this change. Without needing Image A, common sense tells us such features belong to fish-shaped forms.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the figures appear to be made of soft fabric instead of rigid plastic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts figures that have a soft, plush-like texture, which is typically associated with fabric materials. The appearance of softness, likely due to the colored and patterned surfaces, suggests they are made from fabric. In contrast, Image A shows figures with a solid, hard texture typical of rigid plastic. By comparing the textures from both images, it is clear Image B's figures are made of soft fabric.",

      "question": "Are the figures covered in vibrant patterns using blue, green, red, and yellow colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are indeed covered in bright and vibrant patterns. The use of bold and contrasting colors like blue, green, red, and yellow is evident across the four fish figures. These colors and patterns are visually striking and cover each figure completely, making them stand out. These attributes are aligned with the description given.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fins and tails of the fish figures exaggerated in size and shape compared to the original warrior limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fins and tails on the fish figures are quite large and prominent, which can be perceived as exaggerated compared to typical fish features. By referring back to Image A, the original warrior figures did not have such features at all, and their limbs were shaped very differently. Thus, the fins and tails in Image B are not only new additions but exaggerated in comparison to the original limbs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the plush figures arranged on a sandy-textured fabric surface that resembles an underwater scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears to have a sandy texture or weave that may be reminiscent of an underwater or natural setting. However, without detailed props or more explicit underwater cues like bubbles or seaweed, it is challenging to definitively conclude it resembles an underwater scene solely based on the fabric texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the fish-shaped plush toys retain the dynamic, action-oriented poses of the original warrior figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fish-shaped plush toys in Image B do not display variations in pose similar to the dynamic and action-oriented stances seen in Image A, where the warrior figures displayed distinct and energetic postures. Instead, the fish plushies have a more uniform and static appearance typical of plush toys, lacking the same dynamic presence.",
