      "question": "Are the pyramid's steps visibly transformed into segmented, armored body parts resembling a mythical creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pyramid's steps appear to retain their structural form, characterized by their tiered nature, but there is added luminescent decoration and flow that give the appearance of scales or foliage, rather than segmented, armored body parts. This design contributes to a fantastical appearance but does not definitively transform the steps into segmented, armored body parts resembling those of a mythical creature.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the original entrance of the pyramid replaced with a mystical eye featuring an iris and pupil, positioned centrally at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable change at the top of the pyramid where a glowing circular element is present, suggestive of an eye on top of the pyramid. However, the entrance itself does not seem to be replaced with an eye-like feature that includes an iris and pupil. Instead, the eye-like glow is positioned above rather than integrated into the structure itself.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the surrounding jungle been transformed into detailed, interconnected vine-like scale patterns covering the ground and vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jungle surrounding the pyramid is illuminated with glowing lights that resemble abstract, ethereal forms. While there are luminescent features and seemingly interconnected patterns, this alteration does not convert the jungle into detailed vine-like scales but adds a fantastical ambiance instead.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the base of the creature display visible ancient stone patterns such as glyphs, carvings, or geometric designs consistent with the templeâ€™s style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the pyramid does not show any significant addition of stone patterns, glyphs, or carvings that would enhance or change the existing ancient style visible in the original Image A. It maintains the appearance consistent with the architecture of the original image, thus no new patterns relevant to ancient carvings are introduced.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there glowing plants or flowers around the creature that resemble or are inspired by architectural features of the pyramid, such as stepped forms or symbolic carvings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are glowing elements surrounding the pyramid, which seem distributed in a decorative manner. While these elements create a magical atmosphere, they do not specifically resemble architectural features like stepped forms or carvings inspired by the pyramid's structure. They appear more abstract rather than being inspired directly by architectural designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the entire structure transformed into a cohesive, mythical guardian creature with all elements (armor, eye, scales, base, flora) harmoniously integrated to create a strong fantastical impression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the various fantastical elements are added to the pyramid including glowing features, luminescent decorations, and an overall ethereal presence that creates a strong fantastical impression. The integration of these elements, such as glowing lights around the structure and eye-like imagery, contributes to the appearance of a cohesive mythical creature, creating an impression of a legendary guardian.",
