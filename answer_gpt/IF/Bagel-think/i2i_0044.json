      "question": "Is the sandwich depicted in a thick-painted cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich is depicted with bold outlines and simplified color fills, indicating a thick-painted cartoon style. This style involves using exaggerated lines and vivid colors to create a more stylized and non-realistic representation of objects. The common characteristic of this style is the emphasis on bold lines and simplified shapes, which help convey a visually distinct and illustrative look compared to photographic realism.",

      "question": "Are the layers of the sandwich cross-section clearly emphasized with distinct textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich's layers are represented with simple block colors and outlines rather than detailed textures. The cartoon style focuses on shape and form rather than intricate details, so the layers are not emphasized with distinct textures as they might be in a photographic representation or a more detailed illustration.",

      "question": "Has the lettuce been simplified into smeared green shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lettuce is portrayed as simplified, smooth green shapes without any detailed textures or intricate cuts. This approach aligns with a cartoon style that often uses broad strokes and simple shapes to depict objects, rather than detailed rendering found in realistic images. The green shapes on top of the sandwich lack the nuanced texture typical of lettuce.",

      "question": "Are there sauce decorations added around the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are additional decorations around the plate that resemble sauce or embellishments in a stylized format. These elements are drawn as abstract shapes or lines that could represent sauce decorations, which are commonly used in artistic and cartoon depictions to enhance visual aesthetics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Modern Western restaurant menu aesthetics often focus on realistic images that accurately depict food items, emphasizing appetizing detail and clarity. Image B is in a cartoon style which is more illustrative than realistic. While cartoon art can be trendy, the exaggerated and simplified depiction in Image B does not align with typical modern Western restaurant menu aesthetics that aim for realism and mouth-watering detail.",
