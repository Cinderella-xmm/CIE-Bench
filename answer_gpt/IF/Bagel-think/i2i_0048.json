        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors appear more vivid and the distinction between the dark and light regions in the zebras' stripes as well as the grassy ground seems more pronounced compared to typical scenes of natural settings. The increased separation often indicates that the contrast has been enhanced. Therefore, relying on visual cues and knowledge of image processing techniques, we can infer that the contrast has indeed been elevated.",

      "question": "Is there visible improvement in the sharpness of zebras and the grassy ground in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines of the zebras appear slightly more defined, which suggests that sharpness may have been improved. However, the grassy ground seems to have more noise rather than clarity, which indicates that sharpness might not have improved consistently across the image. Thus, balanced reasoning suggests that the visible improvement in sharpness is ambiguous.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the natural textures of the zebras' stripes and the grassland detailed and clear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows increased color contrast, but upon examining the details, the zebrasâ€™ stripes and the grassland do not exhibit clarity in texture; instead, they appear to be less refined and noisy due to the image processing. Natural textures typically include fine details and nuances in pattern, which seem to have been compromised here, leading to the conclusion that they are not detailed and clear.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene still depicts zebras in a grassland setting with no evident inclusion of urban elements. There is no presence of buildings, vehicles, or people that represent the dynamics of city life. Therefore, based on the visual observation, no urban elements have been added.",

      "question": "Has the original composition of the zebras in the grassland been preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the alterations made to the contrast and other visual qualities in Image B, the positioning and arrangement of the zebras and the expanse of grassland remain consistent with Image A. This suggests that the core composition of the image is unchanged, aside from the contrast and detail variations.",
