        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is visible text added to the bottom right corner of the image, which appears to be a poem or phrase. By examining the layout and understanding typical placements of text additions, it can be inferred that the text represents some type of poetic or expressive language, commonly used to enhance or add thematic depth to an image, indicating the presence of a poem.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the poem exactly read: “A beam of morning light, a soft whisper, an unnamed yellow bird perching on a branch”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the inscription on Image B, it is apparent that the text does not match the given phrase. The text in Image B reads differently and does not mention 'a beam of morning light, a soft whisper, an unnamed yellow bird perching on a branch.' Therefore, based on visual inspection, the poem does not match the provided wording.",

      "question": "Is the poem placed at the bottom section of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is located towards the bottom right of the image. Generally, phrases or poems on images are strategically placed to avoid interfering with key visual subjects, thus the placement bottom aligns with common practices for legibility and aesthetic positioning without obstructing the central focus of the bird. Therefore, the poem is indeed positioned at the bottom section.",

      "question": "Has the image quality been maintained after adding the poem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the addition of the text does not appear to degrade the image quality significantly. The details of the bird and the branch remain clear, and the background maintains its soft focus and color gradient. Despite the text overlay, the image retains its visual integrity and aesthetic value, ultimately maintaining its quality.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The font used for the poem in Image B is stylistic and somewhat decorative, which aligns with the artistic and serene tone of the image depicting a yellow bird in soft lighting. Such font styles are often chosen to enhance the artistic expression of visual content, suggesting that the font complements the artistic tone of the whole imagery.",
