    "Question": "Q1: Is the word 'Fresh' located at the bottom left of the image?",
    "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, 'Fresh' is positioned towards the top left. Typically, the bottom left would be closer to the lower edge of the image. Therefore, the position is not at the bottom left. Image A does not contain the text element 'Fresh,' so the comparison confirms the given location in Image B is incorrect if considering 'bottom left.'",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the word 'Sweet' located at the top right of the image?",
    "explanation": "By examining Image B, 'Sweet' is seemingly placed near the upper part of the image but towards the center, not specifically at the top right corner. In Image A, there is no text element for comparison, supporting the discerned location of 'Sweet' in Image B, which is not exactly at the top right.",
    "answer": "No"
