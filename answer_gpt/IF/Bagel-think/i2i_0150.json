      "question": "Has the forest background been replaced with a city balcony railing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to show elements typical of a cityscape setting, such as blurred urban buildings and what looks like a balcony railing. These urban features contrast with the natural forest background seen in Image A, which contains trees and greenery. The structures in the edited image suggest a replacement from a forest to an urban environment.",

      "question": "Is the bird positioned on the sunlit balcony as instructed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is perched on what seems to be a railing that is part of a balcony or urban setting, as indicated by the architectural features in the background. The lighting on the bird does suggest a sunlit condition, similar to how sunlight might hit a balcony railing, making it plausible that the positioning aligns with a balcony setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a blurred city skyline visible in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B shows blurred outlines of tall structures resembling buildings typically found in a city. This blurring effect is characteristic of a background city skyline, which is often out of focus in such images to draw attention to the main subject.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bird maintain its original position relative to the new balcony railing background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the bird is sitting on a branch that aligns with the same angle and positioning relative to its perch. Despite the change in background from a forest to an urban balcony railing setting, the bird itself has not been repositioned or reoriented, maintaining its original posture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall lighting of the image match the sunlit balcony setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears to be bright and consistent with sunlight that would be expected on a balcony. The bird and its surroundings are well-lit, resembling the lighting conditions typically found in open balcony areas during daylight, suggesting that the overall lighting corresponds with such an environment.",
