      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual presentation of the birds resembles stylized anime figures with distinctive features such as large, cartoon-style eyes and exaggeratedly soft feather textures. These characteristics are commonly found in anime-style art where realism is combined with artistic exaggeration, creating a fantasy-like effect. World knowledge of anime art style helps identify these cues indicating transformation into anime-style figures.",

      "question": "Are the anime-style bird models placed on a desktop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, the birds are depicted on a simple background with a subtle gradient likely resembling a stylized or artistic backdrop rather than a physical setting like a desktop. This artistic choice does not suggest an environment typical of a desktop but rather an illustrative or graphic approach. Common scene settings in image artworks are often designed to emphasize the subjects without detailing a real-world setting.",

      "question": "Is the image captured from a casual snapshot perspective, similar to a mobile phone photo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows finely composed bird models with artistic enhancements that would not typically be captured in a casual photograph. This contrasts with casual snapshots that usually have candid compositions and informal subjects captured without artistic modification. Image B displays purposely posed elements indicative of digital art rather than photographic spontaneity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the anime-style interpretation alters some details, the essential bird postures, coloration, and general shape are preserved. The exaggerated features align with anime art conventions but maintain recognizable aspects of the birds' natural form. This indicates a faithful reimagining within the stylized artistic process.",
