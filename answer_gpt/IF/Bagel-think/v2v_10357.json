      "question": "Does the teddy bear have a faceted low-poly appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear displays a low-poly style characterized by flat surfaces and sharp angles, commonly used in low-resolution 3D graphics or modeling, distinguished by geometric facets. This contrasts with the fluffy, textured appearance of the teddy bear in Image A, which is more realistic and smooth.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the motorcycle have a faceted low-poly appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle features a faceted low-poly appearance with distinct geometric shapes and flat surfaces, similar to the teddy bear. This style simplifies the complex curves and details of a motorcycle, unlike the detailed and rounded design in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the scenic background rendered in a low-poly style while still being recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background retains recognizable features such as the distinct rock formation, yet it's rendered in a simplified, low-poly style. This involves fewer details and geometric shapes that make the scene identifiable but not highly detailed like the realistic background in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the teddy bear retained its original pose and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the teddy bear is positioned similarly on the motorcycle, with its arms extended towards the handlebars. Despite differences in rendering style, the pose and position are consistent across Image A and Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motorcycle in Image B is in the same position as Image A, with the design elements simplified to fit the low-poly aesthetic. The pose on the ground and the perspective remain consistent, even though the texture and surface details differ due to stylistic changes.",
