      "question": "Are bold, graphic lines used to delineate the outline and major features of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is illustrated with thick, black lines that define the shape and major features, typical of graphic art styles that focus on strong outlines. The visual cues indicate a stylized representation rather than photorealistic imagery, which aligns well with artistic depictions featuring bold outlines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sunglasses depicted in a flat, vibrant orange color without gradients or shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses are shown in a simple, uniform orange color that lacks any gradient or shading effects. This suggests a stylistic choice emphasizing flatness and vibrancy, often seen in graphic designs to make elements stand out clearly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the beach background composed of simplified, abstract color blocks rather than realistic scenery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background where the traditional depiction of a beach is replaced with broad swaths of color that do not mimic realistic beach scenery. This abstract representation using color blocks is more aligned with a stylized or non-representational approach, focusing on creative visual expression.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both the harness and the shadow under the cat replaced with gradient fills?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the harness and shadow beneath the cat are depicted with flat colors rather than gradient fills. The harness follows the same graphic style seen throughout the image with simple color choices, and the shadow design does not suggest gradients, which are typically used to indicate depth or dimension in more realistic imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are red, blue, and yellow prominently used as flat, high-contrast colors throughout the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features red, blue, and yellow as flat colors, creating a high-contrast and vibrant visual that is typical for pop art or graphic art styles. These colors are used in broad strokes, contributing to the image's dynamic and bold aesthetic without gradients.",
