      "question": "Is the teapot enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is clearly situated under a transparent glass dome, visible by the distinct curved shape of the glass surrounding it. This common display method is utilized to protect and showcase valuable or delicate items, reinforcing the visual observation with world knowledge.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the teapot positioned on a vintage-style wooden base with a visible soft velvet lining underneath?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base under the dome in Image B appears to be wooden, given its brown color and texture that resembles wood. Additionally, there is a soft, plush texture visible below the teapot, resembling a velvet lining, which is often used for decorative purposes to enhance the perceived value and aesthetic appeal of displayed objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there tiny flowering plants and ferns visibly growing from the spout and lid of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible plants growing directly from the spout or lid of the teapot. Instead, plants are seen within the dome environment but not attached to the teapot itself. This observation is supported by visually inspecting the teapot specifically for any growths directly on it.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small butterflies visible, hovering near the floral engravings on the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Butterflies can be seen within the dome, nearby the teapot but not explicitly hovering close to the floral engravings on the teapot. The presence of butterflies within the enclosure implies they are near due to the confined space but not specifically interacting with the engravings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image use primarily subtle earth-toned colors (e.g., browns, greens, soft grays) throughout the scene, avoiding bright or metallic highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes a palette dominated by browns, greens from the plant elements, and the grays from the metallic surface of the teapot. While these are subtle earth tones, the metallic highlights on the teapot may still appear prominent but do not dominate the color scheme, which is overall warm and subdued.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the teapot's floral engravings and decorative elements remain prominent and intact. The detailing showcases flowers and intricate patterns that are consistent with what is typically seen in ornate teapots, showing no significant alterations or obstructions obscuring them.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B covers the entire setup, including the teapot, wooden base, plants, and butterflies. Understanding the purpose of such domes, typically used for full enclosure and protection of its contents, further confirms that there are no apparent openings in this display.",
