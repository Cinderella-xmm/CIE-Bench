      "question": "Does the edited image show the smartwatch transformed into a full cybernetic wrist dragon with dragon-like anatomy integrated into the wrist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartwatch does not appear to be transformed into a full cybernetic wrist dragon. Although its design has been altered significantly to resemble a more technologically advanced or artistic representation, it does not display dragon-like anatomy, such as distinct dragon features like a tail, wings, or reptilian shape covering the wrist. The design is more akin to an artistic or tech-enhanced version of a smartwatch rather than a full transformation into a dragon anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the watch face replaced with a radiant, multi-layered holographic dragon eye featuring glowing elements and depth effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch face is replaced with a design featuring a large eye that includes vibrant colors and glowing elements, creating a sense of depth and radiance. This is visually similar to a holographic effect and could be interpreted as a dragon eye due to its ornate and fantasy-like appearance, fitting the description provided.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original silicone band and its contours replaced with a series of interlocking, metallic silver scales that cover the wrist portion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the smartwatch's band significantly altered from the original silicone band. The replacement resembles a metallic design, but it does not consist of interlocking scales. Instead, it features intricate patterns and a series of metallic details, which do not explicitly mimic scales. The alteration is more stylistic than a direct transformation into scales covering the wrist.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the digital crown been replaced with a glowing, spherical neural node emitting light or energy pulses, resembling a biotech interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital crown is modified to fit the metallic and cyber-enhanced aesthetic; however, it does not visibly emit light or pulses. It still retains its basic shape as a circular element but has been given a metallic appearance rather than transformed into a glowing neural node with biotech implications.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the original app icons on the watch face replaced with glowing, rune-like control sigils that emit light and reflect a tech-magic aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The watch face in Image B has been altered to display a large, eye-like feature instead of showing individual app icons or control sigils. This design choice does not resemble rune-like control sigils or specific tech-magic aesthetic elements. The focus on the eye design dominates the face and lacks traditional icon replacements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image display a dynamic form with visual cues such as energy flow, motion lines, or an active posture that conveys movement and life?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B provides a static image of a highly stylized watch design. Although the presence of an eye and the intricate metallic patterns suggest a theme of enhanced aesthetic, they do not convey dynamic form or active movement. There are no visible energy flows, motion lines, or posture changes that would indicate movement or life in the design itself.",
