        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a character or creature that seems to be inspired by the bubble tea design. This is evident from the bubble tea cup shape, facial features, and style resembling a whimsical character. The color palette includes purple and yellow, reminiscent of elements in bubble tea, and textures such as the pearls on the cup. These design choices indicate a depiction of a creature, albeit not in a typical animal or humanoid form, but integrated as part of the cup design.",
