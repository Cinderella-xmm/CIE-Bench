      "question": "Is the entire scene reimagined as a conceptual tea brand packaging design, where the original tea setup serves as part of the product presentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a distinct packaging design featuring a teapot and a prominent stylized text 'Riul Comprônhe.' The design elements suggest a concept for tea brand packaging, possibly incorporating artistic and thematic details into the product's representation. This gives the impression that the original tea setup, which included a traditional tea layout, has been abstracted and used for branding purposes.",

      "question": "Is the central table redesigned to resemble a tea box lid with visible engraved leaf patterns on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no direct depiction of a central table from Image A in Image B. Instead, Image B presents a stylized, embellished tea packaging with a raised design surrounding a teapot illustration. The design includes leaf motifs, but it doesn’t resemble a central table or a tea box lid. Thus, the comparison finds no redesigned central table.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original tea cups replaced with illustrated representations of sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled paper, or plant-based plastics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain illustrations or representations of tea cups or any specific references to sustainable materials like bamboo, recycled paper, or plant-based plastics replacing them. Instead, Image B focuses on the tea packaging itself, without showing individual tea-serving components.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible tag displaying the text \"Zen Autumn Tea\" written in elegant calligraphy style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text present is 'Riul Comprônhe,' written in a cursive style that could be considered elegant, but it does not say 'Zen Autumn Tea.' There is no tag with the specified text, indicating that this element is absent in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the teapot enclosed within a leaf-shaped silhouette and rendered with subtle earthy textures such as wood grain or soil tones to suggest organic origin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is indeed enclosed within a leaf-shaped cutout and features a leaf motif on it, suggesting an organic theme. The texture appears earthy, supporting the idea of a natural, organic origin. This aligns with the question regarding how the teapot is presented in an earthy, organic context.",
