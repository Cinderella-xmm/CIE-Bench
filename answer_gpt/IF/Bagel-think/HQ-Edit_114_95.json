      "question": "Has the Eiffel Tower been replaced with a bottle-shaped object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure in the center is a tall, slender object with a narrow neck and a wider base, resembling a perfume bottle. The object stands upright and replaces the Eiffel Tower in the landscape. The silhouette and overall shape strongly suggest a bottle rather than the distinctively latticed and tapering framework of the Eiffel Tower. Thus, combining visual cues with common sense identification of bottle shapes confirms that a bottle-shaped object replaces the Eiffel Tower in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the structure have a transparent or glass-like appearance with embossed lattice patterns resembling the Eiffel Tower's framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object replacing the Eiffel Tower has a surface that appears to be transparent or glass-like, as light seems to reflect and refract on it in a way characteristic of glass. Additionally, upon close observation, an intricate pattern is visible on the surface, which resembles the lattice framework of the Eiffel Tower. The patterns are subtly embossed, mimicking the structural design of the original tower. This indicates the presence of a glass-like appearance with lattice patterns.",

      "question": "Is there a gold-colored, metallic-looking base supporting the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the object in Image B appears to be metallic and has a distinct gold color. This is observable through the shiny surface and its reflective properties, typical of metallic objects, particularly those plated in gold. The base supports the main structure of the bottle, consistent with design norms for luxury perfume bottles where such a metallic base is common.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a faint depiction of a Parisian skyline visible on the surface of the glass bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent appearance of the bottle allows for the background to be seen through it. However, there is no distinct, faint depiction of the Parisian skyline visible directly on the surface of the bottle to suggest that such an image has been consciously applied or etched onto it. The skyline visible in the image is part of the background behind the bottle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small, simple, and modern logo located at the neck of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neck of the bottle features a design element that is minimalistic and contemporary in appearance. The logo is identified as the central design on the neck area of the bottle, following common design practices for branding on perfume bottles where the logo placement is critical. This matches the description of a small, simple, and modern logo.",
