      "question": "Does the lens mount area feature a large, intricate mechanical eye with glowing amber irises?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lens mount area is occupied by a mechanical eye with large amber irises. The eye is styled in a manner that suggests intricate design and mechanical details, which helps in identifying the presence of a mechanical eye rather than a typical lens. This is confirmed by the amber color which is distinct from any standard camera lens components.",
