      "question": "Is the cat's body now composed of a fluffy, mist-like substance with a sky-blue hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the cat appears to have transformed from its original solid form into a more cloud-like, fluffy substance. The coloration in the edited image is a sky-blue hue, which resembles mist or a light, airy cloud. This transformation is visually distinct and gives the appearance of a softer, non-solid form typical of mist or clouds.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the knitted cap been replaced with a swirling cumulus cloud cluster on top of the cat's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area that had a knitted cap in Image A is now replaced by a cluster of swirling cumulus clouds. The visuals show a transition from the original textured blue knitted hat to cloud formations that are puffy and have a natural swirl, indicating the presence of cumulus clouds instead of the knit cap.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible cloud-like patterns woven into the cat’s misty body, such as soft streaks or wisps resembling fog or cirrus clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the cat's body as having integrated cloud-like patterns distinctly. The body has elements like soft streaks or wisps that align with the appearance of clouds or fog, enhancing the visual of a misty, ethereal presence. The presence of such textures creates the illusion of cirrus or similar cloud structures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the cat have small, translucent wings with faint, swirling cloud patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual details indicate the presence of small, perhaps delicate-looking wings, adorned with faint swirling patterns typical of cloud formations. These features visually imply the softness and airy quality characteristic of translucent wings, representing a whimsical or fantastical element in the cat’s design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cat’s eyes decorated with gentle, swirling patterns resembling breezes or vapor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) does not depict any swirling patterns or additional decorations around the cat's eyes that would resemble breezes or vapor. The focus of changes appears to be on the body transformation rather than facial features, leaving the feline's eyes in their natural state.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible vapor trails extending along the cat’s body, particularly from its tail or limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual depiction primarily transforms the entire body into a cloud-like mass rather than showing specific vapor trails emanating from particular parts like the tail or limbs. The aesthetic effect covers the entire form rather than extending trails, which indicates a cohesive cloud-like transformation rather than individual vapor trails.",
