      "question": "Have the visible cracks and broken areas on the clock tower been restored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible cracks remain on the tower. Based on the visual evidence, cracks and broken sections are still apparent. When considering a restoration process, one would typically see the consolidation of fragmented parts and removal of cracks. However, Image B shows no visible changes indicative of restoration in terms of removing or repairing the damage. Hence, the conclusion is that the cracks are not restored.",

      "question": "Are there any gaps or missing parts left unfilled on the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, gaps and missing parts are observable, especially in the midsection below the clock face. Analyzing the tower structure, portions appear internally exposed with large holes. Restoration would imply filling and repairing these gaps to achieve a seamless appearance, which hasn't occurred according to the image. Therefore, the visible gaps indicate they remain unfilled.",

      "question": "Do the restored parts match the original texture and color of the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any visible evidence of restoration; the same original texture and color is present throughout as seen with detailed cracking and uniform light coloring typical of untreated stone. Restoration would involve elements like matching the original texture and color to maintain visual coherence with possible restoration interventions. This is absent, indicating a lack of such restorative effort.",

      "question": "Does the restored clock tower maintain the original architectural style and details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural style and details of the clock tower remain consistent with the original. Restoration often ensures preservation or enhancement without altering the architectural integrity. The current structural characteristics in Image B showcase consistent detailing with no added restoration modifications affecting style adherence.",

      "question": "Is the clock face intact and legible after the restoration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the described damaging effects on the tower structure, Image B illustrates that the clock face remains intact and legible, exhibiting well-distinguished roman numerals and hands. Restoration or preservation effort would maintain such features for functional readability, which is evidenced by the maintained clarity of the clock face.",
