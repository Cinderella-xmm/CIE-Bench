      "question": "Has the map and the pins been transformed into a ceramic mosaic tile artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the visual cues, the patterns that depict the map resemble the appearance of traditional mosaic tiles. Mosaics typically consist of small, colored pieces of glass or ceramic fitted together to create a pattern or picture. The layout of Image B shows a complex arrangement of small geometric shapes that mimic a mosaic style. This suggests a transformation from a flat map to a textured artwork characteristic of mosaic tiles.",

      "question": "Does the mosaic artwork display bold patterns and rich textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features patterns composed of many small pieces, each with distinct colors and shapes, typical of mosaic artwork. The mosaic's texture is perceived through these shapes, indicating depth and complexity, thus creating bold patterns. The contrast between various color tiles further emphasizes richness in texture, a common trait in mosaic art.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the original layout and positioning of the map and pins been maintained in the mosaic artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, Image A and Image B, the positions of the pins are consistent in relation to one another and the general route depicted remains similar. While the medium and aesthetic presentation have changed, the spatial arrangement of the depicted path and pins align with the original positioning.",

      "question": "Does the mosaic artwork convey a lively appearance through vibrant colors and dynamic designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mosaic in Image B is characterized by a variety of bright colors and intricate designs created by the placement of different colored tiles. These elements contribute to a dynamic and lively visual experience that is distinct from the more subdued color palette typically found on a paper map. Thus, the mosaic appears vibrant and animated.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the map and pins appear to be made of ceramic tiles rather than their original materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the map and the pins display characteristics similar to ceramic tile materials: a textured and shiny surface for tiles and similarly colored and shaped tiles forming the representation of pins. This transformation from paper (Image A) to a ceramic material effect is evident in the details of the artwork.",
