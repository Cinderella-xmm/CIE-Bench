      "question": "Is the background showing an African savanna scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is characterized by an open, grassy landscape with scattered bush-like vegetation, which is often associated with a savanna environment. The horizon is flat, and there's a wide open sky visible, which aligns with the typical description of a savanna. Knowledge of savanna landscapes, particularly those in Africa, usually includes these features.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the image set against a dark, night-time sky indicative of nighttime?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is dark with the visibility of stars and a celestial pathway, suggesting a night-time setting. The darkened sky coupled with the starry backdrop is a strong visual indicator of nighttime. This perception is based on general world knowledge where such attributes are universally recognized as night time characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the Milky Way clearly visible in the sky above the savanna?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bright broad band of light spanning the sky with dense star clusters is visible, which is typical of the depiction of the Milky Way galaxy in night-time astrophotography. This band is known for its luminous intensity and detailed star topology, characteristics present in this image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are multiple stars visible alongside the Milky Way in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows numerous individual stars scattered across the dark sky surrounding the bright band that represents the Milky Way. This supports the idea that multiple stars are visible, which is typical when observing the Milky Way, as its density highlights numerous stars.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the train and railway tracks appear seamlessly integrated into the savanna background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible contrast between the train and railway tracks against the surrounding savanna landscape. The train and tracks originate from the original image, which shows a railway setting, not a savanna. This incongruity between elements suggests that they do not appear seamlessly integrated, as the tracks cut sharply through the terrain without evidence of natural blending.",
