      "question": "Is the unicorn's body rendered with a smooth, glazed, creamy white ceramic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn looks like a sculpture with a glossy, smooth surface which resembles ceramic material. The creamy white color and the reflective quality of the surface are typical characteristics of ceramic objects. Therefore, combining these visual cues with common knowledge about ceramics leads to the conclusion that the body is indeed rendered with a ceramic-like surface.",

      "question": "Are the mane and tail replaced with delicate, curl-shaped porcelain elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mane and tail in Image B exhibit a curly and structured form typical of stylized sculptures, likely resembling porcelain elements. The glossy surface and intricate curls are indicative of artfully crafted porcelain details, which contrasts with the flowing texture of hair. Therefore, the observation combined with knowledge of porcelain design suggests the mane and tail are replaced by porcelain-like elements.",

      "question": "Is the unicornâ€™s horn a polished metallic spiral?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horn displays a shiny, metallic quality and has a spiral design. Polished metallic surfaces tend to be reflective and smooth, and the spiral pattern is clearly visible. Therefore, based on these observations, the horn is indeed rendered as a polished metallic spiral.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a minimalist gallery setting with neutral tones and no forest elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a neutral-toned background characterized by smooth walls typical of a gallery setting. This contrasts sharply with the dense, dark forest setting in Image A. The absence of natural elements and presence of an indoor setting point to a minimalist gallery environment. Therefore, the unicorn is depicted within a gallery setting in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the unicorn stand on a gently textured stone base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The unicorn in Image B is positioned on a base that appears to be a stone block with visible texture details typical of stone surfaces. This contrasts with Image A where the unicorn stands on natural forest ground. The material and crafting of the base in Image B suggest it is made of stone. Thus, based on these visual cues, the unicorn does indeed stand on a gently textured stone base.",
