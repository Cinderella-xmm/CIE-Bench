      "question": "Has the Nebraska Huskers lettering been reshaped to resemble dried corn husks or golden wheat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lettering of 'Nebraska Huskers' is styled in a font surrounded by motifs resembling corn, which suggests that the lettering itself is designed to evoke the appearance of dried corn husks or golden wheat. This conclusion is drawn from observing the shape and color of the elements around and integrated with the text, which are associated with agricultural produce.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there delicate embroidered motifs of miniature corn cobs and autumn leaves around the gathered waistline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the motifs of corn cobs and autumn leaves are prominently placed around the top section of the dress, above the waistline, rather than around it. This conclusion is based on the visible position of these designs, and embroidered motifs typically add texture, which isn't apparent around the waistline area.",

      "question": "Has the red fabric been deepened to a rich crimson?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a darker shade of red compared to Image A's bright red. This shade can be described as crimson due to its deeper, slightly purplish hue. This reasoning is based on the common understanding of color shades where crimson is known to be richer and darker than standard reds.",

      "question": "Are the gingham accents on the cuffs and back bow still crisp and festive?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the gingham pattern is not present; instead, the cuffs and bow are solid colored without any plaid design. The absence of the gingham pattern indicates a departure from visually crisp and festive accents typically associated with gingham. This judgment is informed by the visual cue of pattern absence.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the gingham accents on the cuffs and back bow remained unchanged in pattern and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the gingham pattern has been removed from the cuffs and bow, changing to a solid dark color. Comparing to Image A, where the gingham pattern is evident, this indicates a change in both pattern and color style. This decision is made by identifying and contrasting the visual cues in both images.",
