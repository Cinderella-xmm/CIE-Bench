      "question": "Is the surface of the bed covered in patchwork fur made from the colors red, gray, navy, and white, resembling animal fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bed's surface is not covered in patchwork fur of the specified colors. Instead, it is covered with a design resembling a tree trunk with green leaves and what appears to be elements like red ears and a tail, suggesting a fantasy or woodland creature theme. The original colors red, gray, navy, and white from Image A's plain geometric comforter design is not present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pillows reshaped into pointed or rounded ears and trimmed with soft-looking leaves along their edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one can observe that parts of the bedding display features resembling ears that are pointed and red, sticking up from the blanket area rather than specifically the pillows. These appear to be purely decorative and are not typical pillow shapes with soft-looking green leaves used as embellishments. In Image A, there are no such features.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the black bed frame been replaced with thin, branch-like legs that resemble natural tree limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the bed frame remains consistent with Image A, which is a standard black bed frame. There is no transformation into tree limb-like structures, and it maintains its human-made, geometric appearance rather than a naturalistic, branch-like theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a bushy, plush red tail extending from the bottom edge of the comforter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the bottom of the comforter, there is a visual element that resembles a bushy, plush red tail extending from the bed. This addition is not present in Image A, which consists only of a neatly laid-out comforter without any such embellishments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the patchwork fur on the bed use only the colors red, gray, navy, and white as seen in the original blanket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a comforter with a completely different theme and color scheme compared to Image A. The comforter's design features natural elements such as green leaves and brown-like colors resembling tree bark, unlike the original red, gray, navy, and white geometric pattern. This indicates that there is no adherence to the original blanket's color scheme.",
