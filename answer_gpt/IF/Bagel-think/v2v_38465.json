      "question": "Are the surfers replaced with pandas holding surfboards?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heads of the people in the image have been replaced with panda heads, making them appear as humans with panda heads rather than full pandas. This alteration gives the illusion that the subjects are pandas, but it is not a full transformation. Therefore, they are not completely replaced by pandas.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sunset and beach setting kept intact without any changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the sunset and beach setting appear vivid, with an orange hue reflecting on the water and sand, matching the natural expectation of a beach sunset. The lighting and ambiance remain consistent with what would be expected from a sunset on a beach, indicating no changes have been made to these elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the pandas positioned similarly to the original surfers, facing the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures with panda heads are standing in the same position as in Image A, with their backs to the camera, facing the sunset, each holding a surfboard on their sides. This indicates that their position and orientation remain unchanged.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pandas holding surfboards in their paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are human bodies with panda heads, so they are holding the surfboards with their human hands, not paws. This human-like behavior is consistent with their visible arms and positioning.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images show the same surfboards, with one being solid yellow and the other having stripes of red, orange, and blue. There are no changes in the colors or design of the surfboards between Image A and Image B.",
