      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is designed to mimic an ancient map with an aged parchment look and sepia tones, commonly seen in depictions of pirate-themed maps.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the treasure chest appears to be a central photographic or digital rendering rather than an ink sketch. The lines are not indicative of sketch techniques such as hatching or cross-hatching, which would be present in ink sketches. Instead, the chest has a realistic finish, using shading and color, not typical of an ink drawing.",
