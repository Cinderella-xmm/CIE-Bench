      "question": "Is the main body of the teapot made of clear glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot's main body appears to be transparent, indicated by the visibility of elements behind the teapot through its body. Glass, particularly clear glass, is known for such transparency properties. Thus, it suggests that the main body is indeed made of clear glass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the body of the teapot transparent, allowing visibility through it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the teapot's body as transparent, permitting visibility through it, as evident by the clarity through which one can see light and reflections cast from behind the teapot. Transparency is a characteristic of clear glass, indicating that the body is transparent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there frosted floral patterns on the surface of the teapot that resemble the original engraved rose and leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teapot in Image B showcases floral patterns on its surface. These have a visual frosted appearance, suggesting a design etched or applied onto the glass akin to frosting. The patterns resemble the original engraved rose and leaves from Image A in terms of design theme.",

      "question": "Are the handle and spout made of tinted amber glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle and spout of the teapot exhibit an amber-colored tint and are translucent, common properties of tinted glass. This coloration and transparency suggest that these parts are made of amber-tinted glass.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored surface showing a clear reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface beneath the teapot in Image B is clearly reflective, as seen by the distinct and sharp reflection of the teapot visible below it. This level of reflection is characteristic of mirrored surfaces, confirming the presence of a reflective mirrored surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparison, the floral patterns on Image B maintain a detailed design akin to original engravings in Image A. Both feature intricate rose and floral motifs, although the medium of frosted glass differs from metallic engravings, the design remains consistent.",
