      "question": "Is the title 'The Evolution of Strength through Time' present and clearly visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing the second image, it is evident that there is no title such as 'The Evolution of Strength through Time' visible at any part of the image. Titles in illustrations often appear at the top or bottom, but this image instead has individual labels associated with each depiction rather than a unified title.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there three distinct representations of the character corresponding to Antiquity, Feudal Era, and Modern Era?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in the second image showcases four distinct representations of a character with varying attire suggesting different periods. Individuals depicted include those labeled with '1', '3', '161', and 'ANSTT HOMAT'. While it may seem to represent different eras, it appears there are more than three depictions and no clear labels specifying only Antiquity, Feudal Era, and Modern Era.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the Antiquity version of the character include mythological armor characteristic of Ancient Greek warriors or wrestlers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction labeled '1' in the second image shows a character wearing a skirt-like garment and holding a staff. The attire and lack of armor associated with Ancient Greek mythological warriors or wrestlers suggest a simpler depiction rather than one featuring elaborate or mythological armor typical of Ancient Greek warriors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the Feudal Era version of the character wear heavy plate armor and hold a large sword?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the character labeled 'FEUVALN APLAUPFRGRAUEDI' features a breastplate and is armed with a staff-like weapon instead of plate armor and a large sword indicative of the Feudal Era. This attire offers only partial resemblance to traditionally heavy armor used in medieval times.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the Modern Era version of the character wear athletic gear and have a barbell across the shoulders in a weightlifting pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character labeled 'THOO INCZ PPARCEL' is depicted in athletic gear and holding a barbell, indicating representation of the Modern Era with a weightlifting pose. Athletic gear is characteristic of modern sports attire, reinforced by the presence of the barbell used for weight training.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the characterâ€™s head, including facial features and expression, identical across all three historical depictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the second image, the face of each character depiction is not visible as it is blurred or obscured, preventing any comparison of facial features or expressions. Hence, identical features cannot be confirmed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the attire and posture in each era depicted with sufficient detail to distinguish them as representative of their respective time periods?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining the second image, the characters are depicted with specific attire and equipment hinting at different historical time periods. However, the ambiguous labels and mixed attire styles make it challenging to distinctly tie each figure to a clearly represented era based on traditional and accurate representations. Therefore, they fall short of being sufficiently detailed for clear historical distinction.",
