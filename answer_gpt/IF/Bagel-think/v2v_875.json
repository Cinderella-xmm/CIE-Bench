      "question": "Is the palm tree and cactus positioned within the frame of a Polaroid photograph being held by a human hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a hand holding a Polaroid-style frame, inside which there are images of a palm tree and parts of a cactus. The setup suggests that the hand is interacting with the photo as a separate object, while the contents are arranged within it. This setup aligns with a Polaroid photograph being held, as the white frame and distinct border signify such a style.",

      "question": "Has the cactus been transformed into a 3D chibi-style character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus has a facial expression typical of chibi-style characters, characterized by exaggerated facial features like large, expressive eyes. While the cactus maintains its natural form to some extent, the integration of these features clearly indicates a transformation into a stylized chibi character.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cactus appear to be stepping out of the Polaroid frame, breaking into the real-world 3D space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus is depicted not fully contained within the Polaroid frame. It appears to extend beyond the white border, suggesting an interaction or transition from the 2D plane of the photograph into the 3D real-world space. This gives the impression that the cactus is stepping out of the frame.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image create a whimsical and surreal effect through the combination of the Polaroid frame, the chibi cactus, and the real-world interaction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image employs a playful combination of elements: a Polaroid frame in a person's hand, a chibi-style cactus appearing from within and beyond the frame, and a palm tree. This interplay of 2D and 3D effects produces a whimsical, surreal atmosphere by creating an imaginative scene that blends photography, character design, and real-world presence.",

      "question": "Is the palm tree still present and unchanged in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm tree is visible within the Polaroid frame held by a hand. While its representation as a photographic element is intact, it appears to be a simplified or illustrative version, as opposed to the realistic depiction in Image A. Therefore, although present in Image B, it has undergone stylistic changes indicative of a different representation.",
