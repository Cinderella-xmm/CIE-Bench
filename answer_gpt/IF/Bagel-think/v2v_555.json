        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual demonstrates two spherical glass structures on top of round bases, filled with snow-like material and featuring model replicas within them. These visual features are classic characteristics of a snow globe, especially as there is a snow effect visible.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
