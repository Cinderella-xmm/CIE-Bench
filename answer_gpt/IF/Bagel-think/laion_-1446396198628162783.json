      "question": "Is the title \"Journey to Space\" clearly displayed in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I examined the overall design to identify any visible titles related to space travel. It lacks any prominent text or title placement commonly used to draw attention. Therefore, the title 'Journey to Space' is not visible on the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the astronaut figure still present and positioned centrally in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut figure is clearly visible. The position is along the left side of the image, not centrally focused. It occupies a side part of the design to allow room for textual and illustrative information on the right.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the background been transformed into a mission control center with elements like control panels, screens, or consoles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the background seems solid and clean with a color gradient, without featuring control room elements like panels, screens, or consoles, which are typically part of a mission control aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there four distinct illustrative icons present, each representing one of the following: Physical Training, Technical Skills, Simulators, and Space Suit Check?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed four illustrative icons, each accompanied by related text suggesting different themes of training or skills. Based on the visuals, these icons convey meanings potentially tied to such categories as physical training and technical skills.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the four training stages represented in distinct, vibrant color-coded sections (e.g., different colored backgrounds or labels)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each section representing training stages seems to have a different vibrant color, likely indicating diverse categories. These colors act as labels, enhancing the understanding and differentiation between stages.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the text describing each training stage written in clean, modern typography (e.g., sans-serif font, consistent style)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Assessing Image B, the typography for the textual information describing the training stages appears to be in a clean, modern font style. This likely includes sans-serif fonts, commonly used for legibility and modernity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the overall design appear cohesive and informative, with a logical flow connecting the astronaut to the training stages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition establishes a flow from the astronaut figure toward the categorized training stages via colored components and structured text. This design layout supports coherence and maximizes information delivery.",
