      "question": "Does the edited image show the stapler from both the front and rear views side by side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two staplers placed side by side, with one showcasing the front view and the other showcasing the rear view. These views are aligned horizontally, suggesting side-by-side placement, allowing the viewer to compare both aspects directly. This use of alignment is a common method for a clear representation.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The staplers in Image B are indeed positioned horizontally side by side. This orientation facilitates straightforward visual comparison between the front and rear views due to their adjacent placement.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the stapler's front and rear views are fully visible without any elements being cut off. This allows for a complete inspection and comparison of both views, facilitating accurate assessment of the stapler's design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both staples in Image B feature the same shade of blue along with matching metallic details, consistent across both the front and rear views. This uniformity suggests they are designed to be identical in color and design details.",
