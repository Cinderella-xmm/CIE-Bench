      "question": "Are the monitor, computer tower, speaker, keyboard, and mouse rendered as chibi-style collectible figures with oversized, sparkling, expressive features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the monitor, computer tower, speaker, keyboard, and mouse are not depicted with oversized, sparkling, expressive features typical of chibi-style. Instead, they are represented realistically, similar to typical electronics. The only chibi-style characteristic shown is the presence of a cartoon-like figure beside the setup.",

      "question": "Is the box designed with a soft cream hue and delicate gold accents, resembling a refined portable case for tech accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box design features a pink hue rather than a soft cream hue, and while it has gold accents, the overall aesthetic suggests a toy or collectible packaging rather than a refined tech accessory case, which would typically be more minimalistic and sleek.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the monitor figure the centerpiece, with the computer tower placed nearby, the speaker and keyboard on either side, and the mouse in the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monitor figure indeed serves as the centerpiece. It is flanked on each side by the speaker and keyboard, while the mouse is placed in front of the keyboard. However, the computer tower figure is not depicted nearby or prominently but is instead indicated in the backdrop of the screen.",

      "question": "Is the lid of the box engraved with the phrase “TECH LIFESTYLE” and adorned with whimsical circuit and gear designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the box lid with an engraved phrase that appears to read 'TECCFED TLEYHEE,' which does not say 'TECH LIFESTYLE'. The design lacks any circuit or gear motifs, emphasizing instead a playful font design typical of toy packaging rather than tech-related theming.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the backdrop include a circular window offering a view of a cozy, tech-inspired room bathed in soft, warm lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monitor screen itself features an image of a cozy room with soft, warm lighting and technological elements such as a computer setup, but there isn't a circular window in the box. The cozy room scene is simply part of the monitor's display graphics and does not imply a physical window in the backdrop.",
