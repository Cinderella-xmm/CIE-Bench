      "question": "Does the house appear as a sentient, mythical treehouse creature rather than a conventional dwelling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure of the house has been altered to resemble a fantastical or mythical creature. The straw roof is replaced with a leafy canopy with orange vegetation, and the presence of what appears to be eye-like features on the facade gives the house a sentient appearance. This transformation from a conventional dwelling to a more creature-like form, along with the tentacle-like structures below, contribute to the appearance of a sentient, mythical treehouse creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vertical support columns replaced with detailed, leg-like wooden structures resembling limbs or roots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the support structures under the house are modified to resemble tentacle-like limbs or roots, giving it a more organic and creature-like appearance than traditional support columns.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the straw roof been replaced by an overgrowth of realistic leafy branches forming a natural canopy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof is transformed into what looks like a canopy of green leaves interspersed with orange growths. This gives the appearance of an overgrown, natural leafy canopy rather than a straw roof.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the satellite dish transformed into a large, lidless eye with visible iris and pupil features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the satellite dish remains unchanged. The eye-like feature is found on the facade of the treehouse, not the satellite dish. Thus, the satellite dish itself does not depict an eye with an iris or pupil.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the exterior walls of the house maintain their bamboo-like pattern and do not resemble natural tree bark with detailed textures. The alterations are mainly focused on roof and support structures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, trailing vines are not visible. The treehouse instead features vine-like tentacle structures that resemble roots or limbs, but they are part of the structural support, not vines descending from the house.",
