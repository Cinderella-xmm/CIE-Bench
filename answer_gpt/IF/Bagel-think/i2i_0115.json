        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sharp contrast between the character and the battlefield background as the detailed combat elements and explosions differ significantly from the character's artistic style. This results in an abrupt transition with visible disruptions in integration.",
