      "question": "Does the image exhibit dramatic lighting with strong contrasts between light and shadow, typical of Baroque art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a dramatic lighting style with strong contrasts between light and shadow. The angelic figure is illuminated in a way that accentuates its features and creates a sense of depth and drama. This is characteristic of Baroque art, which often uses chiaroscuro (the use of strong contrasts between light and dark) to create a dramatic effect.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the garments worn by the angelic figure elaborately textured and rendered in deep, rich colors rather than plain white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the garments of the angelic figure are depicted with intricate textures and are predominantly in deep, rich colors like amber and gold.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B have visible gold accents along the feathers that enhance their detail, adding a sense of luxury and intricacy without changing the fundamental shape of the wings.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a celestial background filled with soft, voluminous clouds and visible distant stars, creating a heavenly and otherworldly atmosphere.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has an overall color palette dominated by warm tones, including gold, amber, and deep reds. These colors create a harmonious and rich visual effect, which is characteristic of Baroque art's emphasis on dramatic and emotionally engaging visuals. Image A, in contrast, uses cooler tones and lacks this warm richness.",
