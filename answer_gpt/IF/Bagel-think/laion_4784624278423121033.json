        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, various colorful and stylized atom-like designs are present, but rather than appearing realistic, these designs are artistic renditions meant to be playful and thematic, adhering to a child-friendly design. Based on visual analysis and common understanding, these do not constitute realistic illustrations of atoms but rather stylish and symbolic representations.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, various labeled arrow elements are present but do not specifically mention scientific terms like electrons, protons, or neutrons. Instead, the labelling uses fictional or altered names which doesn't directly relate to scientific components.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
