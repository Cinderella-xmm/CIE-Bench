    "Question": "Q1: Is there a large title saying “Catch the Wave” placed above the horizon?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the title displayed prominently across the top of the image reads 'CAS THE WIOLE.' The expected phrase 'Catch the Wave' does not appear, although the placement above the horizon is consistent with where such titles might typically be placed in promotional or thematic images for emphasis. Hence, my analysis shows that the specific title does not match.",
