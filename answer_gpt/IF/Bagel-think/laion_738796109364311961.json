      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the image been transformed into a cartoon-inspired illustration style with exaggerated features and bold lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate a transformation into a cartoon-inspired illustration style. This is evident from the exaggerated features, such as the outlines and color tones, which are not typical of photographic images. The use of bold lines and simplified, vivid colors further suggest a cartoon-like appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the player’s muscles visibly enlarged and exaggerated compared to realistic proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On inspecting Image B, the players' muscle outlines appear more defined and exaggerated compared to realistic human anatomy. This style choice is consistent with cartoon illustrations, where characters often have exaggerated physical features for dramatic effect.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the uniform colors been intensified to appear more vibrant and saturated than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The uniform colors in Image B appear distinctly vibrant and saturated, which is a common attribute of cartoon or animated styles. This intensification of colors helps in making the images more visually striking compared to the realistic color tones seen in photography.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the team’s logo prominently displayed and emphasized on both the helmet and jersey in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the team logos on the helmet and jersey don't appear overly emphasized or distinct compared to the overall image composition. Normally in cartoons or stylized cards, logos could be stylized or prominently highlighted, but this does not seem to be the case here as per the visual cues.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B seems to feature a simplified and stylized depiction of a crowd and field, with elements that fit the theme of a cartoon sports card. The use of vibrant and bold graphics supports this assumption.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image is displayed within a sleek, black box frame that has the appearance of a collector's item packaging. The design suggests a matte finish with a transparent element that allows the cards to be viewed, fitting the description of a collector’s box.",
