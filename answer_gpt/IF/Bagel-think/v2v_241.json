        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the horse and elephant are shown as 3D models with exaggerated, cute features characteristic of the chibi style, such as large heads, rounded shapes, and oversized eyes. This style is known for portraying characters in a simplified and cute manner.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) depicts the horse standing on the elephant's back, consistent with the scene in the original image (Image A). This positioning is visible through the arrangement of the models, maintaining the same concept as depicted originally.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a grassy field and a sky, but these elements are depicted with less detail and appear stylistically altered to match the chibi style. They lack the photorealistic detail seen in Image A, which showcased an accurately rendered landscape.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes an ornate frame around the scene, which is evident from the decorative embellishments and borders that surround the models of the horse and elephant. This indicates that the scene is contained within a framed display, as opposed to Image A where there is no frame.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the horse and elephant are rendered as 3D models, as indicated by their solid, volumetric form and shading. This contrasts with the photorealistic depiction of the animals in Image A. The models exhibit characteristics typical of 3D rendering, such as defined shapes and depth.",
