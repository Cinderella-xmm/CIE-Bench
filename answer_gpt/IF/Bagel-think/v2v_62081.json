      "question": "Has the portrait been reimagined in a dynamic Xieyi style Chinese ink wash painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays characteristics typical of Xieyi style Chinese ink wash paintings, such as fluid lines and expressive brushwork.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the texture of the dark hair and the form of the blue coat conveyed using bold, spontaneous black ink strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures for the dark hair and coat are indeed created with bold black ink strokes, creating a spontaneous and dynamic effect. The strokes are free and fluid, indicative of a Xieyi ink painting style, rather than the meticulously detailed rendering seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the facial area and cravat using softer, graded washes, effectively representing shadows and depth. This technique aligns with the softer rendering method typical in ink wash paintings, compared to Image A's detailed and precise depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a plain white surface without visible texture. The antique qualities of the paper observed in Image A, which add historical context, are absent in Image B's reimagined style.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B simplifies the original patterned wooden frame into broad and suggestive ink outlines. This approach aligns with the minimalistic and expressive character of Xieyi painting style, as compared to the intricate detail of Image A's frame design.",
