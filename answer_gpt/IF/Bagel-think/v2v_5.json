      "question": "Is the zebra depicted in a stylized 3D chibi form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is clearly depicted in a stylized 3D chibi form, characterized by its exaggerated features such as large eyes and a simplified body structure, which are common traits in chibi art styles. This is distinct from Image A, where the zebra is realistically depicted. The visual cues in Image B such as the proportions and cartoon-like appearance of the zebra indicate the chibi style.",

      "question": "Are the zebra’s stripes and distinctive pattern accurately depicted as in the original photo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are present; however, they have been stylized to fit the chibi art form. While the pattern mimics the original black and white striping of a zebra, it does not offer scientific accuracy or realism compared to Image A, where the stripes follow the natural pattern closely.",

      "question": "Is the zebra engaging playfully with a miniature replica of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the zebra interacting with a cake that is visually smaller compared to the original image cake in Image A. The design of the cake in Image B resembles the one in Image A, but its smaller size implies a playful and miniature aspect consistent with the playful atmosphere. Thus, it can be interpreted as playfully engaged with the replica.",

      "question": "Is the zebra leaning forward with a curious look while seated on the edge of an oversized Instagram frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the zebra enclosed within an Instagram frame, where the zebra appears to be leaning forward with a curious stance, which suggests engagement with the items around it, specifically the cake inside the frame. This design choice links the zebra with social media tropes of personalized framing in a playful way. Such a presentation is not evident in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top section of the Instagram frame prominently displays the username “ZerbaRover,” not “ZebraLover.” The text is clearly visible and spells out “ZerbaRover,” which is distinct in comparison to any hypothetical spelling given in the question.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B does incorporate social media elements like the Instagram frame itself, there are no floating icons such as like, comment, and share depicted around the scene. Instead, it features a hand holding the frame with logos for platforms like Instagram and Twitter, not floating icons.",
