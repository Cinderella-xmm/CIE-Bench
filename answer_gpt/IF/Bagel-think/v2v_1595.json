      "question": "Does the edited image feature a halftone pattern with dots creating shades and gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has small dots arranged in a pattern typical of a halftone technique. This style creates a shaded effect, giving the impression of different tonal values and gradients without solid colors. This technique is widely used in graphic design to create texture and depth with simple dot matrices, thereby confirming the presence of a halftone pattern.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there vivid contrasts between the colors and elements in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes bold graphical representation with black and white elements alongside a bright pink background. Such choices provide strong visual contrasts, particularly between the pink and the monochrome elements of the soccer ball and net. This contrast makes components stand out distinctly and is a common technique in graphic and pop art design to draw attention to different parts of the artwork.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the soccer ball and goalpost in the edited image have sharp, well-defined edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball and goalpost are depicted with clear outlines and defined shapes. This is characteristic of graphic art styles where precision in line work is employed to highlight edges and structures. The design favors bold contours, ensuring that each element is sharply delineated against the contrasting background.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the soccer ball and goalpost been simplified into bold, graphic forms while remaining recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the soccer ball and goalpost as simplified black and white components. The shapes maintain their recognizability despite being reduced to basic forms, achieved through thick outlines and minimalistic design approaches. This is a typical method in graphic art to retain the identity of objects while adopting an abstract or simplified style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall visual effect of the edited image striking, with a vibrant appearance and dynamic composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a bright pink background against graphic elements in black and white, creating a high-impact visual effect. The stark contrasts and bold stylistic choices contribute to a dynamic composition that is meant to be eye-catching and energetic. This aligns with techniques used in pop art and graphic design to evoke strong visual responses.",
