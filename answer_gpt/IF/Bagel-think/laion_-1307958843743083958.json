      "question": "Are the cheetah figures replaced with gold-finished perfume bottles that maintain their original seated poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetah figures seem to be replaced with perfume bottles that are gold-finished. The construction of the perfume bottles is distinct from the seated pose of the original cheetahs. They are upright and bottle-shaped rather than mimicking an animal pose. Therefore, the original seated poses are not maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the botanical center been replaced with a translucent, green-tinted glass façade that has a cascading downward appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the center piece between the two perfume bottles is a translucent, green-tinted glass structure. This façade appears vertical and symmetrical rather than cascading downward, as inferred from the shape and position observed in image B. Thus, it does not have a downward cascading appearance.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"Savanna Essence\" present on the bases of both objects in a chic serif font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is text on the bases that appears to be written in a chic serif font. However, the text reads 'Lauren, Lorraine,' not 'Savanna Essence.' Thus, the specific text 'Savanna Essence' is not present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image convey an elegant and luxurious aesthetic consistent with a high-end retail perfume display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases gold-finished perfume bottles and a central green-tinted glass structure, both elements adding to a high-end and luxurious appeal typical of retail perfume displays. Gilded accents and clear, reflective surfaces also add to this aesthetic. Thus, the image does effectively convey a luxurious perfume display.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the two gold-finished perfume bottles symmetrically positioned on either side of the central glass façade, preserving the original spatial arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottles are placed symmetrically on either side of the central green-tinted glass structure, mirroring the spatial setup seen with the cheetahs in Image A. This indicates that the spatial arrangement has been preserved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a reflective surface beneath the objects showing clear reflections of the perfume bottles and central façade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base on which the objects are placed does not exhibit significant reflection that would indicate a reflective surface. The objects and the base lack visible reflections, suggesting that such a surface is not present.",
