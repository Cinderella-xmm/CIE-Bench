      "question": "Is the astronaut rendered in a cartoon style with simplified features, bold lines, or exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is depicted with exaggerated proportions, simplified features, and clearly defined, bold lines typical of cartoon art. The simplicity of facial features and the use of vibrant colors also support the cartoonish style, characterized by an uncomplicated, whimsical appearance. This differs significantly from the realistic portrayal of an astronaut we've typically seen.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible action zig-zag lines surrounding the astronaut’s limbs or body to indicate motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is shown in a dynamic pose with a raised arm and a forward stride, conveying motion, but lacks zig-zag lines or other visual indicators commonly used in cartoons to emphasize action or movement. Thus, while the pose suggests movement, there are no explicit visual motion lines depicted.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the astronaut’s suit feature decorative celestial motifs such as stars, planets, or galaxies in blue and silver tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing the astronaut's suit in Image B, we see a design that is simple with color accents rather than complex or highly decorative celestial motifs. While the background contains stars and planets, the suit itself is primarily utilitarian, lacking additional celestial designs. Thus, it does not feature such motifs on the suit itself.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the moon surface beneath the astronaut depicted in an illustrated, non-photorealistic style with simplified or graphic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moon surface in Image B is portrayed in a simplistic, illustrative style consistent with the cartoonish aesthetic of the overall image. The craters are represented with simple outlines and filled with plain, bold colors, typical of graphic elements rather than the detailed, textured appearance found in real life or photorealistic depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image include a space-themed border (e.g., stars, planets, rockets) and a visible textured white background resembling card stock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is set against a border adorned with a vibrant combination of colors and a pattern that complements the space theme. The background, while visually clean and simple, closely resembles a card stock texture with fine details. However, it lacks specific celestial icons within the border itself.",
