      "question": "Is the tank's body composed entirely of olive and dark green LEGO bricks, showing a blocky, modular construction consistent with LEGO building style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank appears to be constructed entirely out of LEGO bricks, characterized by a blocky appearance. The color palette includes sky blue and multiple colors like red, yellow, and green, which is diverse compared to typical olive and dark green colors. This transformation gives the tank a stylized and whimsical look. By comparison, Image A's tank is not made of LEGO bricks and maintains its realistic military design in traditional colors. Thus, the tank in Image B is not composed purely of olive and dark green LEGO bricks.",

      "question": "Has the orange tiger decal been replaced with a pattern made of colorful LEGO plates forming a whimsical tiger face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pattern on the front of the tank is created using colorful LEGO plates, arranged to form a tiger face similar to a decal, with visible LEGO studs enhancing the whimsical appearance. In Image A, the tiger face is a flat painted decal. The re-creation using LEGO bricks is apparent in Image B, suggesting a transformation from a painted application to a constructed one.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tankâ€™s treads made of textured LEGO bricks with visible studs and blocky segments, rather than continuous rubber tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the tank's treads as constructed from LEGO-like elements with visible studs and blocky segments, deviating from the continuous, smooth design of traditional rubber tracks seen in Image A. The LEGO texture and construction mimic the style used in LEGO sets, indicating a clear change in design.",

      "question": "Is the tank positioned on a smooth, flat wooden platform without visible gravel or irregular edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank still appears to be placed on a ground consisting of gravel with wooden borders, similar to what is observed in Image A. There is no indication of the gravel being replaced by a smooth, flat wooden platform in Image B. Hence, the setup remains consistent between the two images concerning the ground the tank is on.",

      "question": "Is there a back panel made of green LEGO bricks behind the tank, designed to mimic foliage and replace the natural tree background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background foliage remains unchanged, consisting of actual greenery, similar to Image A. There is no indication of a constructed back panel made of LEGO bricks. Thus, the natural tree background is retained, and not replaced by anything resembling LEGO construction.",
