    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image include the apple's current front view as originally shown?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are multiple apples displayed without a clear singular focus on a front view of one apple. The presentation includes two whole apples and one apple cut in half. The original Image A focuses on a single apple viewed from the side/front. Thus, the edited image doesn't prominently feature a singular, front-facing apple as in the original image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a cross-section view of the apple that shows its inner flesh texture and seeds?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly shows an apple that has been cut in half, displaying the inner flesh and seeds. The visual cues include the white flesh and the seeds positioned symmetrically in the center, which are typical characteristics of an apple's cross-section.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the image contain a top view that clearly displays the apple's stem structure and calyx area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, two complete apples are visible. The top views of these apples show the stem area but may not fully and distinctly represent the calyx region completely as would typically be expected in a top view. However, the stem structure is present and identifiable.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the current front view of the apple remained unchanged compared to the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there isn't a single apple featured from the front as there is a composition of multiple apples, including a cut one, so there is no identical front view of an apple like in Image A. Therefore, the front view of the apple hasn't remained unchanged.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the cross-section of the apple reveal both the flesh texture and seeds accurately?",
    "explanation": "The cross-section in Image B depicts the inner part of the apple, including the white flesh and seeds at the center. However, the inner details appear stylized and lack some realistic texture details, like the seed casing and intricate flesh striations, which are noticeable in a natural apple cross-section. Thus, while it shows these elements, they are not accurately detailed.",
    "answer": "No"
