      "question": "Has melted cheese been added on top of the hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable addition of a light yellow layer placed over the sausages in the hot dogs. This color and placement are typical characteristics of cheese slices that are positioned to melt over the hot dogs while they are on the grill. The warmth from the grill suggests the possibility of the cheese starting to melt, which is a common practice in grilling. Therefore, based on the visual cue of the yellow layer closely resembling cheese, combined with common grilling practices, we can conclude that melted cheese has been added.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are small pieces of an ingredient on top of the yellow cheese on the hot dogs. The size, shape, and color of these pieces are consistent with common toppings like fried onions. Fried onions typically have a crisp texture and are a popular addition to enhance flavor. Thus, the presence of these browned, small pieces on the cheese layer suggests that fried onions have been added as a topping.",

      "question": "Is there a barbecue tong added near the grill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a metallic utensil positioned above the second hot dog, which is consistent with the appearance of a barbecue tong. Tongs are typically used for manipulating food on grills, and their usual design includes metal handles. Given the utensil's placement and the nature of the activity (grilling), it's reasonable to deduce that this is indeed a barbecue tong intended for use with the hot dogs.",

      "question": "Are the hot dog buns and sausages still visible and identifiable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the buns and sausages are prominently visible beneath the added toppings of cheese and fried onions. The buns have a distinct light brown color and texture that identifies them as typical hot dog buns. The sausages are the darker cylindrical items placed within these buns, retaining their recognizably smooth and glossy appearance despite the toppings. Thus, the buns and sausages are still visually distinct and identifiable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can clearly see the grill bars and the bright orange glow of the flames or embers beneath the hot dogs, indicating active grilling. This is consistent with the visual cues of open grilling, where elements like the grill bars and flame are typically visible. These visual indicators confirm that both the flames and grill are still visible beneath the cooking hot dogs.",
