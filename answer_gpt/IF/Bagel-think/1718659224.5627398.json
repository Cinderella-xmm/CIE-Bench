      "question": "Is the fortress constructed entirely from golden-brown cookie dough with darker edges resembling baked edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress is designed to look like it is made from cookie dough, with a consistent golden-brown color. The edges are slightly darker, suggesting shading or the effect of baking, which is typical for baked goods such as cookies. This visual cue aligns with the typical appearance of a baked cookie, where the edges brown more than the center due to the baking process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the walls and towers of the fortress have a golden-brown base color with visibly darker edges, mimicking baked cookie dough?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The walls and towers in Image B appear to have a golden-brown color with darker edges, which strongly mimics the appearance of baked cookie dough. This color distribution gives the impression of a real cookie structure where the edges appear darker due to baking, providing a realistic touch to the cookie illusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls depicted as finely piped, smooth, and glossy streams resembling royal icing rather than natural water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfalls are depicted as smooth and glossy streams that look very different from natural water. This appearance is more akin to royal icing, which is often used in baking for its smooth texture and glossy finish, making the waterfalls look as if they are made from piped icing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees in the image made from smooth, uniformly green-colored marzipan with no realistic leaf detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B appear to be smooth and uniformly colored in green, lacking detailed leaf textures. This is consistent with marzipan, a confectionery paste, which can be molded smoothly and uniformly without intricate detailing. The absence of realistic leaf detail supports the conclusion that these trees are intended to resemble marzipan.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cookie castle placed on a large, flat, white ceramic platter that is clearly visible beneath and around the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire cookie structure, including the water, trees, and fortress, is clearly positioned on a flat, white ceramic platter. The platter is prominently visible, serving as the base for the edible composition, indicating that it is an intentional part of the setup.",
