    "Question": "Q1: Have the vegetables and knife been broken down into geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "Image B features vegetables and a knife transformed into abstract geometric forms. The carrot cubes, celery cuts, and onion dice are presented as geometric shapes rather than being depicted with realistic texture, indicating a breakdown into geometric shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the geometric shapes rearranged in an abstract manner?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents shapes that are no longer arranged in a manner reflecting a realistic setting but rather in an abstract pattern. This is evidenced by the irregular positioning and flow of shapes across the canvas, indicative of abstract arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the vegetables and knife still recognizable despite being abstracted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although there is abstraction into geometric shapes, the resemblance to the original form of carrots, celery, onions, and a knife persists due to the retained basic outlines and positioning, enabling recognition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the color palette been simplified to align with Cubist style?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the coloration is vibrant yet distinct from the natural colors found in Image A. The palette reflects a simplification with an emphasis on broad, bold areas of color which is characteristic of Cubismâ€™s tendency to simplify forms and color.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the image show overlapping planes and multiple perspectives characteristic of Cubism?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays evident overlapping of shapes and varying visual perspectives within the forms, emblematic of Cubism's technique of showing multiple views and intersecting planes instead of a singular perspective.",
    "answer": "Yes"
