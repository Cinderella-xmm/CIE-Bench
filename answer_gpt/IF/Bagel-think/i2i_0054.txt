    "Question": "Q1: Is the background changed to a matte solid gray?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been changed to a clean, solid white color. In assessing the background color, the visual cue from Image B clearly indicates that the background is a flat, uniform white, not gray. A matte solid gray would have a distinct shade of gray, which is not present here.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are there any visible shadows in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure of the elephant does not cast any visible shadow on the ground or background.
