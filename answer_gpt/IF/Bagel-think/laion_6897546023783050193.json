      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit characteristics of ukiyo-e art such as flat color areas, strong outlines, and stylized forms instead of realistic 3D rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Ukiyo-e art is known for its use of flat color areas, strong outlines, and a lack of textured shading, resulting in a stylized form. In Image B, these characteristics are evident with the flat blue and gold color areas, the strong outlining of the figure's robes and hands, and the stylized representation of waves, aligning with the aesthetic seen in traditional Japanese woodblock prints.",

      "question": "Are the robes flattened into a two-dimensional, flowing pattern with visible indigo and gold coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robes in Image B are represented using a flat, two-dimensional style with a flowing pattern. The colors used are clearly indigo for the robes and gold for the background, which are typical colors in ukiyo-e art. This style contrasts with more realistic 3D rendering and instead follows the traditional Japanese artistic style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms are outlined with strong, sweeping lines that resemble the brushstroke quality typical of Japanese calligraphy. This dynamic outlining adds to the stylized and animated look of the figure, which is characteristic of ukiyo-e art.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the face is blurred, the overall style of the image suggests a minimalistic and serene approach to facial depiction, consistent with ukiyo-e art, which often features simplified and calm facial expressions. The style suggests an emphasis on simplicity and serenity typical in traditional Japanese art.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
