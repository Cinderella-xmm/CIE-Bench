      "question": "Is the character rendered in a 3D cartoon style with soft lighting and a vibrant personality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character exhibits a 3D cartoon style, evident from the smooth, rounded features, and a playful, exaggerated representation typical of animated characters.

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there stats or skill bars included in the image, tied to themes like Relaxation +10 or Hospitality +8?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes several colored bars located at the bottom of the character image, which are typically styled as indicators of stats or skills in gaming or animated contexts. However, there are no specific numbers or themes, such as +10 or +8, explicitly mentioned next to these bars.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, there is a banner displaying the title 'Clovalle', suggesting a name or brand. However, there is no distinct nameplate at the bottom, but rather stat bars. This setup partially aligns with the prompt but does not fully satisfy having both a title banner and a nameplate.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The borders of Image B are smooth and rounded, and the overall presentation resembles a stylized card or character panel, which may share similarities with a boxed figure's packaging. However, it does not strictly depict a box design, particularly since the edges are more decorative than structural like a box.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs warm tones throughout the depiction of the breakfast setting, with browns, yellows, and soft lighting enhancing the sense of warmth and coziness appropriate for a cozy breakfast theme, similar to what is conventionally used to reflect such atmospheres.",
