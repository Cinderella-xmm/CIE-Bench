      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire scene, including the laundromat and the person holding laundry, depicted using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire structure of the laundromat and the person holding laundry appears to be made from Lego bricks. This can be inferred from the typical Lego block pattern on the walls and the simplified, blocky dimensions of the person, which align with the design of that toy.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the person and the folded laundry represented as Lego figures and objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B shows that the person is constructed using Lego figure parts, such as the distinct cylindrical shape of the head and simplified clothing details typical of Lego figures. The folded clothes the person is holding are simplified and mimic the style of Lego elements, indicating the use of Lego objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the laundromat environment, including the walls, doors, and washing machines, constructed using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually showcases the laundromat environment, including its walls laid in a pattern characteristic of Lego bricks. The doors and washing machines emulate the geometric, block-like aesthetic typical of Lego structures, which suggests they are constructed using such bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the scene have a static, constructed appearance typical of a stop-motion diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements seen in Image B, such as the stiff and uniform texture of Lego bricks and figures, provide a static and constructed aesthetic. These characteristics are typically observed in stop-motion dioramas where objects appear posed yet immobile, reflecting the method of artistic representation with stationary subjects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the overall scene composition been maintained while adapting it to the Lego aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing Image B to Image A, the overall composition, including the placement of the laundromat, stacked laundry, and the person, retains its original arrangement. This suggests that while the aesthetic has been adapted to a Lego format, the fundamental scene layout remains consistent.",
