      "question": "Is the husky depicted as a plush toy rather than a live animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is clearly a plush toy depicting a husky. This conclusion is drawn from several visual cues: the texture of the surface, which is soft and velvety, and the simplified and exaggerated features typical of plush toys. These features differ from the realistic characteristics of a live animal, such as a natural fur texture and lifelike anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the husky's paws appear significantly larger and more exaggerated than those of a real husky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The paws in Image B are stylized and exaggerated, typical of plush toys meant to emphasize certain cute features. The size and roundness of the paws are not consistent with those of an actual husky, which would have more proportionate and anatomically correct feet.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the fur texture been replaced with a soft, velvety fabric appearance throughout the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture of the husky in Image B is that of a soft, velvety fabric, typical of plush toys, rather than the detailed, realistic fur seen on a live husky in Image A. This can be inferred from the smoothness and uniformity of the material seen in the plush toy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial features, particularly the eyes, rendered as embroidered details rather than realistic ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and other facial features are rendered in a stylized and simplified manner, often seen in plush toys, rather than possessing the depth and realism one would expect from an actual animal. The eyes are distinctly embroidered or appliqu√©d, which is different from the detailed, life-like eyes seen in real animals.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the plush toy placed on a clean wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the plush toy on a wooden surface, and the background lacks clutter, indicating it is indeed on a clean wooden shelf. This is evident from the visible wooden texture and the clear, organized space around the plush toy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background minimalist, without any natural elements like snow, trees, or sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is minimalist, showing only the wooden surface and plain backdrop without any natural elements such as snow, trees, or sky that are present in Image A. This minimalism highlights the plush toy as the central focus.",
