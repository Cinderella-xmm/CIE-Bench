        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig is depicted with exaggerated features, such as a large head, big ears, and an expressive face, typical of cartoon style.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pig in Image B possesses an exaggerated head size relative to its body, a common trait in cartoon depictions. This disproportionate head size often serves to enhance expression and make the character appear cuter and more whimsical.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig is seen holding a microphone and wearing green sunglasses, rather than DJing. The depiction focuses on the pig as a character performer holding a microphone, which does not correspond to the image of DJing. The distinguishing feature here is the green sunglasses, emphasizing the pig's playful style.",
