      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress retains its original geometric pattern layout, but it clearly transformed into a mosaic style with geometric shapes.

By examining the visual cues like the overall design of the dress and its geometric nature, one can connect this transformation with mosaic art, revealing a distinct tribal motif.",

      "question": "Have the beaded necklace and bracelets been replaced with stained glass tile designs featuring vibrant colors and lead-line-like borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the necklace and bracelets with characteristics similar to stained glass tiles. The vibrant colors and distinct outlines resemble the visual attributes of stained glass, with lead-line-like divisions that separate each 'bead' or section transliterating into tile-like appearances. This interpretation stems from the clearer defined sections and polished look aligning with stained glass design knowledge.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hairstyle reveals characteristics of a bas-relief sculpture, with a sense of depth and shadow adding an enhanced sculpted texture. The colors and structure of the hairstyle appear untouched, maintaining the original design while adopting a more prominent 3D appearance through stylized treatment. This aligns with world knowledge of bas-relief making techniques, emphasizing depth while retaining recognizable features.",

Each component fits harmoniously together, with artistry amplifying the cultural motifs and ensuring congruence across attire, jewelry, background, and hairstyle. This conclusion draws upon multicultural art processes which celebrate authenticity while transforming traditional motifs aesthetically.",
