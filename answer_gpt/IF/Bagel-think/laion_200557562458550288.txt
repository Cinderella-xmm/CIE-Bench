    "Question": "Q1: Has the image been transformed from a flat jersey display into a full promotional poster layout?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes a background and additional graphic elements, such as stylized motion lines, which are typical components of a promotional poster layout. In contrast, Image A is a simple presentation of the jersey with a plain background. The presence of these additional design elements in Image B suggests that the image has been converted into a promotional format.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the edited image depict the jersey as an anthropomorphic cyclist character with a body shape and posture?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit any characteristics that suggest a body shape or human-like posture. The jersey retains its original form without modifications to arms, legs, or a human-like pose. This indicates that Image B does not depict the jersey as an anthropomorphic character.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are facial features (such as eyes, nose, or mouth) present on the chest area where the star was originally located?",

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the dominant colors in the image limited to blue, white, red, and gray, matching the original jersey's color scheme?",

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there stylized motion lines or speed effects visible around the anthropomorphic cyclist character?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are stylized graphic elements around the jersey that resemble motion lines or speed effects, suggesting movement or a dynamic environment. These elements are part of the promotional design strategy, unlike Image A, which lacks any such dynamic effects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the text 'Ride Like a Star!' displayed in bold, diagonal font in the bottom left corner of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text at the bottom left does not say 'Ride Like a Star!' Instead, it is visually unclear and appears altered. Thus, Image B does not include this specific text format.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the overall layout combine structured composition (e.g., balanced elements) with energetic visual cues (e.g., motion lines, strong angles)?",
    "explanation": "Image B features both structured elements from the jersey design and additional energetic visual cues like motion lines, creating a dynamic and engaging composition. The layout uses the jersey's structured design elements and combines them with external graphic effects to convey dynamism, unlike the purely structured presentation in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
