      "question": "Is the saxophone transformed into a serpent-like creature with a coiled body and metallic scales?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object on the red cushion is distinctly different from a saxophone. Instead, it appears to be a coiled serpent-like creature with a body embellished by scales and gemstone-like structures, resembling the attributes of a mythical or stylized serpent. The analysis involves recognizing the shapes and decorations that are typical of serpents rather than musical instruments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original saxophone keys replaced with gemstones that exhibit a shimmering, reflective quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a serpent-like figure adorned with shiny, reflective gemstones along its body, which is a transformation from the saxophone keys. The shimmering quality is more akin to gemstones rather than the metallic appearance of saxophone keys. This analysis relies on identifying the visual characteristics typical of gemstones and comparing them to the known appearance of saxophone keys.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the bell of the saxophone been transformed into an open maw featuring sharp, stylized fangs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the supposed 'bell' region of the saxophone features a stylized serpent's mouth with sharp fangs, differing significantly from the traditional open end of a saxophone. This analysis is based on recognizing the typical features of a mouth with fangs and contrasting them with the usual bell shape of a saxophone.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the saxophone’s neck extend into a coiled serpent body decorated with delicate filigree patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'neck' of the figure in Image B seamlessly extends into a serpent’s coiled body, which is decorated with patterns and gemstones that give the impression of delicate filigree work. This involves identifying the visual features of the serpent and understanding the continuity of the 'neck' into the body.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the reed been transformed into a barbed tongue extending from the serpent’s maw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a serpent-like figure with its mouth open, but there is no discernible barbed tongue-like structure extending from it. The absence of this specific feature suggests that the reed's transformation into a barbed tongue hasn't occurred. This analysis uses the known part of a saxophone, the reed, comparing it with the visual presentation of the serpent's mouth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the saxophone/serpent resting on a red velvet cushion identical in appearance to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B feature the saxophone/serpent resting on a near-identical red velvet cushion. The cushion's texture, color, and positioning remain consistent between the two images, confirming their similarity. This involves direct comparison of the base element supporting the main object in both images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the lighting still focused on the central subject, producing a spotlight effect similar to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, similar to Image A, the lighting is concentrated on the central subject, creating a spotlight effect that highlights the serpent-like figure resting on the cushion. This involves analyzing the distribution and concentration of light in the image and how it creates a focal point on the main subject.",
