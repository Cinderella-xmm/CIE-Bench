      "question": "Is the image formatted as a cereal box design with visible box-like structure or paneling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition mimics a promotional poster or an advertisement with bold text and bright colors at the top. However, there is no clear box-like structure or paneling that indicates a cereal box design. A cereal box typically has defined edges and panels showing nutritional information or branding elements, which are not present here. The imagery appears more chaotic with animated characters and dynamic elements rather than a structured box.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the background been replaced with an urban sports scene featuring graffiti-style elements such as spray paint art, street markings, or urban structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a backdrop with bright graffiti-style elements, evident in the bold, colorful spray paint lettering and abstract shapes. These elements are synonymous with urban art seen in street environments and distinguish it from the more serene and natural setting of Image A. The urban theme is reflected in the graphics and the energetic feel of the scene.",

      "question": "Is the text “Basketball Breakfast Blitz!” displayed in bold font across the top of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is prominent text displayed at the top of the image, it reads 'KASNTENSE FARDE! BEIST BPSII!!!' and does not mention 'Basketball Breakfast Blitz!'. Hence, the specific phrase is not present in the image.",

      "question": "Does Patrick’s shirt now feature printed basketball-themed motifs (e.g., basketballs, hoops, or court designs)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Patrick’s shirt has a colorful design with a large yellow “3C” on it. There are no clear basketball-themed motifs like basketballs, hoops, or court designs evident on his shirt. This design does not appear directly related to basketball but rather fits into the vibrant and chaotic style of the image.",

      "question": "Are SpongeBob’s shoes replaced with sneakers that visibly feature cereal loop patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, SpongeBob is wearing what appears to be stylized sneakers that are a bright color, but there are no visible cereal loop patterns present on them. The shoe design seems more aligned with trendy sneaker styles rather than explicitly showing cereal hoop designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are numerous illustrated objects resembling small clusters or pieces of cereal flying around SpongeBob and Patrick, indicative of cereal pieces. These are sprayed across the scene, adding to the vibrant and energetic aesthetic of the image.",
