    "Question": "Q1: Are the surfaces of the cabin and surrounding landscape rendered with visible, dappled brushstrokes instead of smooth, photorealistic textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin and landscape have a distinct artistic rendering style, where surfaces are characterized by visible, dappled brushstrokes. This illustrative style diverges from the realistic textures typically found in photographs. The use of broad strokes and expressive patterns suggests a painterly approach, emphasizing texture and detail in a stylized manner.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the colors in the image softened and blended, with reduced contrast and no sharp edges between color areas?",
