      "question": "Are the bookshelf and books fully constructed from LEGO bricks instead of wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a structure built entirely from LEGO bricks, using the iconic interlocking design and plastic material typical of LEGO. Based on its appearance, all components, including the 'books' and 'bookshelf,' are visually consistent with LEGO construction, showcasing a blocky form composed of rectangular pieces. Therefore, the bookshelf and books appear to be constructed entirely from LEGO rather than wood.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all books represented as individual LEGO blocks in earthy tones (e.g., brown, tan, terracotta)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'books' are discernibly composed of LEGO bricks in earthy tones, specifically using combinations of brown and tan. These blocks create a pattern similar to books placed on a shelf. The choice of colors aligns with common representations in LEGO sets that mimic natural tones, suggesting authenticity in the visual display that aims to replicate book textures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the intricate carvings on the original shelf and book spines replicated using darker LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the comparison, Image B does not display intricate carvings on the shelf or spines as seen in Image A's wooden depiction. Instead, Image B uses uniform LEGO bricks to construct the entire object without any replicated carving details, thus lacking darker bricks that might emulate carved patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the LEGO tower narrow progressively toward the top, forming a tapered shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO tower with visible tapering as it ascends. This is achieved by decreasing the width of the layers, creating a pyramidal structure that becomes narrower as it approaches the top. The design reflects common building techniques used to simulate tapering through incremental adjustments in LEGO constructions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the surface of the LEGO structure smooth and plastic-like, lacking any wood grain or natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the LEGO structure in Image B exhibits the smooth and glossy texture typical of plastic LEGO bricks. It lacks the visual effects of wood grain or any natural texture seen in wooden furniture. This quality is inherent to the material aspect of LEGO, contrasting significantly with the wooden texture of Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background plain and muted, without any patterns or textures, to highlight the LEGO structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is plain and muted, with no discernable patterns or textures. This simplicity in the backdrop effectively emphasizes the LEGO structureâ€™s form and details by creating a contrasting visual field, which is a common practice in displaying such objects to enhance their visibility and focus, especially in photographs or exhibits.",
