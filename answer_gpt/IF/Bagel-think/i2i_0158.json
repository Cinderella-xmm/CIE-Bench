    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the front view of the car clearly visible in the final three-view combination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B primarily shows the rear view of the car. Based on world knowledge of standard three-view combinations, which typically include front, side, and rear shots, the front view is absent in this image. This absence and focus solely on the rear aspect make the answer clear.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the left side view of the car clearly visible in the final three-view combination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on the rear perspective of the car, with a slight angle that suggests part of the side, but it's not distinct or clear enough to categorize as a 'side view' in a three-view combination.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The primary focus of Image B is on the rear view of the car, with notable features such as taillights and the bumper visible. This is clearly a rear aspect shot.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the three views of the car presented in a non-overlapping manner, ensuring they are distinct and clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given Image B only showcases the rear view of the car and lacks representation of other views, it cannot be considered as part of a non-overlapping three-view presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall presentation of the combined three-view image align with the standards suitable for car magazines or showroom flyers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not present a combination of different views, and being a single focused image, it's inconsistent with standard car magazine or showroom flyer formats that typically utilize clearly distinct front, side, and rear views to offer a comprehensive perspective.",
