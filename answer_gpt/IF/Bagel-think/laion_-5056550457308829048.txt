    "Question": "Q1: Is the image formatted as a cereal box design with visible box-like structure or paneling?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the composition mimics a promotional poster or an advertisement with bold text and bright colors at the top. However, there is no clear box-like structure or paneling that indicates a cereal box design.
