      "question": "Is the entire body of the truck composed of layered, reflective crystal planes resembling emerald and jade facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck has been visually transformed to resemble a construct made from materials like emerald and jade. The surfaces of the truck appear to be faceted and reflective, similar to how crystalline structures would be presented. This transformation suggests that the entire body of the truck is depicted as a series of reflective planes, resembling gemstones such as emeralds and jades. This analysis is based on the visual cues presented in the image, combined with the common knowledge of what properties such gemstones usually exhibit.",

      "question": "Are the wheels transparent and made of quartz with visible internal crystalline patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the truck with wheels that appear to be transparent, resembling a quartz-like material. The transparency and the visual cues suggest internal crystalline patterns, as commonly associated with quartz structures. These indicators lead to the conclusion that the wheels are designed to look transparent and mimicking quartz formations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the truck placed on a smooth, white marble platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is indeed depicted standing on a base that resembles a smooth, white marble platform. The visual characteristics of the base—smooth texture and veined patterns consistent with marble—indicate it has been staged to look like a marble platform. This observation is a result of comparing the visual features with known attributes of white marble surfaces.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cabin and body surfaces feature angular, faceted crystal planes that reflect and refract light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually conveys the truck as having surfaces that are angular and faceted, much like cut crystals. These planes seem to reflect and refract light, a quality often seen in crystals and cut gems. The design cues, such as sharp edges and multiple reflective surfaces, support the notion that the image aims to replicate the appearance of these properties.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crystal truck maintain the original structural proportions and layout of the military truck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B with Image A, while the material and visual appearance have significantly changed, Image B maintains a recognizably similar shape, structure, and layout to the original military truck shown in Image A. This includes the overall proportions, such as the placement of the cabin and the back compartment, indicating that despite the material transformation, the fundamental form remains consistent.",
