    "Question": "Q2: Is the glow-in-the-dark effect visible on the wall sticker depiction, indicating that it would illuminate in dark conditions?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not visually indicate a glow-in-the-dark effect, as such an effect would typically be highlighted by showing the sticker in darker conditions or by explicit mention in the context. The image shows a well-lit room with the sticker clearly visible, but without any indication of it glowing or lighting up.
