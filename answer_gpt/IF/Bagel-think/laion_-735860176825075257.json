      "question": "Are all architectural elements of the building rendered with sharp, angular edges characteristic of a paper-cut art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the architectural elements appear to have sharp, angular edges, which are indicative of a paper-cut art style. The edges are clearly defined and prominent, giving a crisp visual effect. This style is often seen in paper-cutting art where the edges and lines are intentionally sharp to create a distinct aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are the window frames and plant motifs enhanced with visible gold foil-like accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible gold foil-like accents on the window frames or plant motifs.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the entrance awning colored in a vivid red or crimson hue. The color is noticeably bold and stands out prominently in the scene, helping to emphasize the entrance. This choice of color contrasts with the rest of the building and draws attention to the area below.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has a textured appearance resembling cream-colored paper. The texture and color are consistent with what is typically seen in textured paper, adding an artistic or vintage quality to the image, commonly used in postcards for aesthetic purposes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image appears to have a decorative border around its edge, which includes geometric and arch-like patterns. These designs are typical of artistic framing that can be featured in postcard designs, adding a distinct decorative first impression.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does include a visible border surrounding the postcard, consisting of geometric and decorative elements which clearly contribute to the framed presentation of the overall image. The presence of this border means it does not have a borderless edge.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a single postcard design depicting the hotel scene, rather than three separate postcards. The singular image focuses on one artistic rendition rather than multiple variations.",
