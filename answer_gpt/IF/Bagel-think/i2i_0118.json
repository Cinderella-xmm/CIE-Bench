      "question": "Is the character shown in a half-body form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character, Pikachu, is depicted with its entire body visible, not just the upper half. This can be determined by observing that its legs and tail are clearly shown within the image. A half-body depiction would typically only display the character from the waist or chest up.",

      "question": "Does the character appear to be jumping out of a childrenâ€™s tablet screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu is depicted inside a rectangular frame that resembles a screen, likely a television or a digital device. The character's dynamic pose and the portrayal of its limbs being extended as if reaching out of this screen imply the concept of jumping out of it. This is a common effect used to simulate the character coming to life from the screen.",

      "question": "Are the character's arms open in a welcoming gesture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu's arms are shown extended outwards, which is often interpreted as a welcoming or friendly gesture, akin to going in for a hug or displaying excitement. This posture is common in animated characters to convey approachability and warmth.",

      "question": "Does the overall depiction simulate an interactive entertainment effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the representation of Pikachu seemingly emerging from the screen in Image B, the depiction simulates an effect where the character is interactive or engaging with the viewer. This technique is frequently used in entertainment media to give the impression of interaction with the audience.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the screen that Pikachu is interacting with has a simple, dark frame and lacks distinctive features typical of children's tablets, such as rounded edges or a bright, colorful design. The frame is angular, and the design is minimal, suggesting a standard screen rather than a tablet aimed at children.",
