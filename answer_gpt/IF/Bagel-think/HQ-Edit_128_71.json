      "question": "Is the Statue of Liberty fully enclosed within a vintage-style glass lantern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Statue of Liberty is visibly placed inside a glass enclosure that resembles a dome or cloche, characteristic of vintage-style glass lanterns. This enclosure encompasses the entire statue, lending to the appearance of being fully enclosed within the structure. The visual elements such as the dark framing at the top and bottom of the glass enclosure support this interpretation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the Statue of Liberty display both verdigris (greenish-blue) and copper-hued (reddish-brown) patinas on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Statue of Liberty is primarily shown in a solid greenish-blue color, simulating the verdigris patina that covers the actual statue due to weathering. There isn't a distinct presence of a copper-hued patina visible on its surface in this representation. The pedestal is in a brown color, but it does not represent a copper patina on the statue itself.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background sky rendered in soft pastel colors such as pale pink, lavender, or mint green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the background does not feature an open sky with soft pastel colors. Instead, it appears to have a muted, possibly artificial color palette that is more uniform, serving as a backdrop within the glass enclosure and lacks distinct pastel hues. The background is more beige, likely due to the lighting and the indoor nature of the display.",

      "question": "Are there tiny ships and wave patterns visible beneath the Statue of Liberty in the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the diorama of Image B, beneath the Statue of Liberty, we can observe miniature ships and a stylized representation of waves. These tiny ships and wave motifs are part of the design, adding a sense of context and scenery to the display within the glass enclosure.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a visible revolving mechanism (e.g., rotating base, gears, or central axis) at the foundation of the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the diorama has a base that appears to support the glass enclosure, there are no visible components like gears or a mechanism suggesting that a rotating or revolving function is present. The visual presentation focuses more on the aesthetics of display rather than functionality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the diorama maintain the recognizable grandeur and detailed features of the Statue of Liberty despite being miniature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diorama manages to capture the iconic and recognizable features of the Statue of Liberty, such as the crown, torch, and draped robes, even though it is reduced to a miniature form. While some detailing is simplified due to scale, the essential characteristics that convey the statue's grandeur and identity are maintained.",
