      "question": "Is the gorilla depicted as a wood-carved sculpture rather than a living animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the gorilla appears to be depicted as a wood-carved sculpture. The surface has the typical wooden texture, which is glossy and brown, and the contours give the impression of carved lines and edges, suggesting craftsmanship in wood. This style aligns with how sculptures are often represented in artistic woodwork.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the contours of the gorilla's body defined using multiple shades of brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla sculpture exhibits different shades of brown and is detailed with carved lines that enhance its contours. The use of varied brown tones is typical in wooden sculptures to show depth and dimension, helping to distinguish different parts of the body.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are detailed fur-like textures engraved into the surface of the wooden sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the presence of carved lines and details on the gorilla sculpture, there are no specific fur-like textures engraved into its surface. The lines seem more general to represent anatomical features and not individual fur strands.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the arms and legs of the sculpture visibly smoother than the rest of the body, lacking fine anatomical detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms and legs of the gorilla sculpture in Image B appear smoother and more stylized compared to other parts, based on the artistry typical of wooden sculptures, where detailed anatomical features might be simplified for artistic effect.",

      "question": "Has the leafy backdrop been replaced with an etched wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla is set against an etched wooden background rather than a natural leafy setting. This aligns with the transformation from a living animal scene to a crafted wooden sculpture environment, with elements carved into the wood.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the background with dark-toned leaf shapes that are integrated, matching the rest of the wood carving style. These shapes are crafted into the wooden surface, consistent with the art form of wooden sculpture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering both Image A and Image B, the gorilla maintains the same seated posture and hand placement. The wood-carved sculpture in Image B replicates the pose of the gorilla from the original image, indicating that the basic arrangement and position remain unchanged.",
