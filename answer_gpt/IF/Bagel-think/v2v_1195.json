      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the cabinets and skateboard are decorated with bold geometric patterns, which form the sections within the stained glass style.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained glass style inherently places a strong emphasis on geometric shapes through its segmented appearance.
