      "question": "Is the capybara's body rendered as a polished bronze metallic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible parts of the object appear to have a metallic sheen, suggesting a bronze finish. This is indicative of an artistic or sculptural representation, which contrasts with the natural texture and color of a living capybara. Given these observations, the body in Image B appears to be made of such a material.",

      "question": "Has the blue knitted hat been replaced with an intricately detailed bronze helmet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object that replaces the hat has the shape and texture of a helmet, characterized by its metallic appearance. The helmet lacks the texture of a knitted material and instead, it shows a smooth and polished surface typical of metal craftsmanship, likely made of bronze based on its similar appearance to the described sculpture.",

      "question": "Are the sunglasses now composed of glass lenses set in bronze frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible eyewear like sunglasses on the object due to the blurred content. The absence of visible frames implies that the sunglasses previously encountered in Image A are absent or not visible in the same fashion in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the fur patterns preserved as engraved lines on the bronze surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The part of the sculpture shown in Image B does not display any intricate patterns resembling fur lines, as the metallic surface is generally smooth. Typically, fur patterns are omitted or stylized in metal sculptures. The visual cues available do not show engraved lines that simulate fur.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base visible in Image B appears to be made of marble, with characteristic vein patterns that are indicative of marble material. This suggests an elegant yet understated design typical of many marble bases used for sculptures.",
