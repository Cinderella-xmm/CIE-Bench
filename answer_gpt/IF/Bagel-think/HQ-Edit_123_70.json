      "question": "Is the image split into two distinct panels, one on the left and one on the right (or top and bottom), forming a comic layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear separation within the image that divides it into two parts, one on the left featuring a character with text, and one on the right showing a scene with a bear and fish, depicting a comic-like layout.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, there is text beneath the character holding a sign, but it does not say 'Ever wondered how a salmon ends up in a bear's mouth?'. Instead, it's illegible text.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 in Image B does not contain a fact box with the specified text. The visual does not present additional text features beyond the images of the fish.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is not clear and appears to be jumbled or distorted, making the typeface difficult to categorize as a clear, modern sans-serif font.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of Image B is more of a rectangular format, but without specific dimensions provided in the question, determining if it matches an exact 16:9 aspect ratio is not possible just from the appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While there are two distinct panels in Image B, the text is not legible, and the visual content does not form a clear, logical, and educational sequence, such as a structured explanation of a process.",
      "weight": 1,
