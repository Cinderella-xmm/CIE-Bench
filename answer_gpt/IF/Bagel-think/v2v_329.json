        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles appear realistic in shape and dimension, similar to traditional bicycles, rather than having exaggerated 3D cartoon-like features typical of chibi style, which usually includes oversized heads and smaller bodies or elements. Therefore, the bicycles are not represented in a chibi style.",
