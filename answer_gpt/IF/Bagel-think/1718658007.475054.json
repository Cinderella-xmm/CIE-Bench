      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits several features typical of 1950s vintage design, such as the use of smooth, rounded forms, a simplified color palette, and bold, stylized outlines.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky, sea, sand, and octopus are depicted using subdued, pastel tones. These soft colors replace realistic or highly saturated tones, creating a stylized look.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the octopus with prominent, thick black outlines that define its shape.
