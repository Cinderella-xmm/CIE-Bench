    "Question": "Q5: Does the ceiling now feature a cascading flow of iridescent, leafy vegetation resembling a verdant waterfall descending from the top of the greenhouse?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling area does not feature iridescent, leafy vegetation resembling a waterfall. Instead, leafy vines and large branches with leaves seem to fill the space, creating a lush, forest-like atmosphere. However, they do not cascade downwards like a waterfall; they remain in place as hanging vines and dense foliage from the top. This differs from a dynamic cascading flow.",
