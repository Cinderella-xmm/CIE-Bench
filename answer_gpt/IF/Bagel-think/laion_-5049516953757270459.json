      "question": "Is the entire heart-shaped board composed solely of LEGO bricks forming a mosaic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heart-shaped board is filled with components that exhibit a distinctly LEGO-like texture and appearance. LEGO bricks are typically characterized by their blocky, interlocking nature, which is evident here in the way individual elements are segmented and arranged. The surface displays the typical studs and structures associated with LEGO pieces. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that the heart-shaped board is composed of LEGO bricks forming a mosaic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks used to represent the food items colored appropriately to match the original produce (e.g., blue for blueberries, red for tomatoes)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks representing the food items generally adhere to the color palette of their real-life counterparts as seen in the original image (Image A). For example, the blueberries are represented with blue bricks, the strawberries and tomatoes with red bricks, and the broccoli with green bricks. This shows that effort has been made to match the colors of the bricks with the actual colors of the food items.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are different LEGO brick sizes and shapes used to simulate textures (e.g., smooth bricks for avocado, small round bricks for berries, larger chunky bricks for broccoli)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO representation uses various brick sizes and shapes to mimic the textures of respective food items. For instance, the avocado is represented with smoother, flatter bricks, while the blueberries appear to be mimicked with smaller, rounder bricks, and larger, chunkier bricks are used for broccoli. This diversity in shapes and sizes suggests an attempt to simulate different textures using LEGO bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all food items in the LEGO mosaic have clearly defined and distinct borders separating them from adjacent items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while most of the LEGO food items are represented distinctly with color and form separation, not all of them have clearly defined or distinct borders. The transition between some items, particularly those with similar color, appears less distinct due to the interconnected nature of LEGO constructions, which may result in a blending of boundaries.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall shape of the LEGO mosaic remain a perfect heart, matching the original boardâ€™s silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing the silhouette of the heart-shaped board in Image A with the LEGO version in Image B, the overall shape remains consistent. The LEGO mosaic retains the heart shape, aligning with the dimensions and curves of the original board.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the LEGO mosaic placed on a solid, neutral gray base with no visible texture or pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background on which the LEGO mosaic is placed is a solid, neutral gray. There are no visible patterns or textures in this base, and it provides a uniform backdrop that contrasts with the colorful LEGO construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the LEGO mosaic exhibit a clear pixelated, blocky appearance consistent with a LEGO construction, rather than a smooth or realistic rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO mosaic in Image B distinctly presents a pixelated, blocky appearance typical of LEGO constructions. This characteristic appearance is due to the modular and interlocking nature of LEGO pieces, which create a segmented, pixel-like design rather than smooth, seamless surfaces. This aesthetic is clearly evident in the edited image.",
