      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the chocolate cake is transformed into an anthropomorphic character with facial features while keeping the original luscious chocolate glaze and layered design intact.

      "question": "In Panel 1, is the cake girl depicted as sad and tearful, resting a hand on her cheek, with the text box containing the specified dialogue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of the edited image, the cake girl is shown with large eyes, indicating no tears or visible sadness. There's no hand resting on her cheek. Instead, she is on a plate with a spoon beside her, and a speech bubble above her head. This suggests she is speaking rather than displaying sadness.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2, the cake girl is not depicted gripping a spoon as a weapon. She appears surprised with an exclamation mark and a cute expression. Spirals and sparkling effects are absent, indicating the scene does not convey determination with a weapon-like presentation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both panels in the edited image contain text boxes with a font that appears playful and casual, resembling handwritten styles. This can be identified by observing the irregular shapes and sizes of the characters, typical of a handwritten appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features four panels in total, arranged in a standard quadrilateral format often seen in comics, which does not adhere precisely to a 2:3 aspect ratio commonly associated with longer vertical manga panels. However, it possesses a vibrant, energetic, and fun cartoony aesthetic, evident from the lively expressions and exaggerated features of the anthropomorphic cake character.",
