      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the package prominently displays a bowl filled with whole grains; however, there is no visual inclusion of nuts, tropical fruits, or natural sweeteners visible. The presence of images of a lemon and garlic suggest added elements to the flavor rather than being part of the grain composition in the bowl. Therefore, the visible items do not comprehensively show all the specified ingredients.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a space that looks like a styled kitchen counter, evidenced by its wooden surfaces and presence of foods like garlic.
