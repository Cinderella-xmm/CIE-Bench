    "Question": "Q2: Does the kite have a design that resembles or suggests it could be made as a paper craft model?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the kite's components are shown as simple geometric folds, typical in paper crafts like origami. The two folded objects in Image B display paper-like qualities and structured patterns that suggest they are models possibly created from paper. This aligns with common characteristics of paper craft models, where paper is cut, folded, and assembled into shapes. The visual appearance supports the idea that the kite could indeed be replicated as a paper craft.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the colors used for the kite vibrant and suitable for representing cultural significance on a postcard?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows predominantly yellow shades on the folded objects. While yellow can be considered a bright and vibrant color, the vibrancy and cultural significance can vary greatly depending on context. However, yellow is generally regarded as an energetic and optimistic color globally. Despite the absence of multiple colors or intricate cultural designs in Image B, the presence of a bright yellow hue does provide some level of vibrancy, but might not fully capture cultural significance without additional context or complementary imagery often found in cultural representations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the kite prominently featured in the image, with minimal distracting elements around it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the objects representing the kite are placed against a plain white background with only minor distractions (such as a color strip). The focus is clearly on the kite representations, allowing the viewer to observe the structural details without much interference from other elements. This setup enhances the prominence of the kite-like objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the structural details of the kite, such as its frame and tail, well-defined and clear enough to suggest it could be crafted from paper?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the kite-like objects with distinct folds and creases indicative of paper crafts. The clarity in the detail of the fold lines and the geometric design suggest the objects are made from paper and could easily be replicated. The creased texture and defined shapes emphasize the handcrafted nature, particularly suitable for paper craft models.",
    "answer": "Yes"
