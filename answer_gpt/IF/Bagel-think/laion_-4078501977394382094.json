      "question": "Is the title \"Desert Adventure Chronicles\" displayed at the top or in a prominent location of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the top, there is some text that appears to be in a decorative font, achieving prominence in placement. However, the text displayed reads 'Road Trip' rather than 'Desert Adventure Chronicles', which would suggest a different theme related to travel. Using common knowledge, the theme relates more to a journey rather than an adventure chronicle. The emphasis of these phrases indicates the purpose or mood of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly three separate panels arranged horizontally or vertically in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a singular composition with no explicit division into panels. The image includes only one scene depicting a green van interacting with a cactus fountain. There is no division into multiple panels, horizontally or vertically, indicating a single canvas instead of a multi-panel comic strip.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the green van in Panel 1 have its roof tilted upward slightly, resembling a hat tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green van is shown without any unusual tilting of the roof. The van appears stationary, and there is no distortion or tilt that would resemble a 'hat tip'. Combining this visual information with world knowledge, a 'hat tip' would imply an angle or slant in the position or shape, which is absent here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text bubble in Panel 1 containing the words “Ah, the open road calls!” clearly visible and correctly spelled?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are text bubbles present above the cactus and van, but they contain undecipherable text which seems intentionally distorted or scrambled. This suggests it's meant to be humorous or artistic gibberish rather than coherent dialogue with correct spelling.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the headlights of the van in Panel 2 significantly wider or brighter than in other panels, indicating surprise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the van's headlights are consistent in their appearance without any significant alterations in width or visibility that would imply surprise. The headlights are of a standard size and brightness compared to the rest of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the cactus in Panel 2 morph into a fountain-like structure with water spraying or flowing from it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cactus that creatively morphs into a fountain-like structure with water visibly flowing from it. This transformation is clear in the depiction and suggests an unusual artistic interpretation of a desert plant.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the van in Panel 3 shown splashing water with visible droplets or ripples, and is it parked near a body of water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the van positioned near the fountain-like cactus, but there is no depiction of the van splashing water or visible droplets. The cactus resembles a source of water, not a body of water that would enable such splashing or parking scenario.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there green plants or trees visible around the oasis in Panel 3?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases green shrub-like plants near the fountain cactus, which mimic the flora surrounding an oasis albeit in a cartoonish form. These plants align with the common interpretation of desert vegetation providing greenery in a barren environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Is the overall image width exactly three times its height?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a standard single-panel layout with typical dimensions, not evidently stretching to a width three times its height. This proportion suggests standard frame dimensions rather than unusual extended width.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",
      "question": "Do the colors and art style of the comic strip match the warm, cartoonish, and vibrant style of the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a warm and vibrant color palette with cartoonish elements, echoing the style of Image A. These stylistic cues inform the continuity of themes related to desert narratives with playful and visually engaging artistry, sustaining the consistency from the original image.",
