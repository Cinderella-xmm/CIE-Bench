      "question": "Are there exactly five nesting dolls arranged in descending sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a group of five objects is visible, each differing in size. They are arranged from the largest on the left to the smallest on the right, in an orderly manner reminiscent of nesting dolls displayed outside their nested form. This arrangement confirms that there are five in total, each progressively decreasing in size.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the nesting dolls placed on a surface that appears to be made of wood, indicating a common, classic material for tables or display surfaces. The dolls are aligned in a tidy sequence alongside the wood grain pattern, supporting the conclusion that they are placed on a wooden table and are organized neatly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A visual assessment of Image B reveals a mostly square appearance, with dimensions that appear close to equal rather than adhering to a typical 3:2 aspect ratio, which would be noticeably rectangular. Therefore, the proportion does not match the horizontal 3:2 aspect ratio specified.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls in Image B exhibit distinct characteristics of the chibi style, such as disproportionately large heads, small and simplified bodies, and exaggerated facial features with wide smiling expressions. These traits align well with the common description of chibi style, confirming they maintain that stylistic theme.",
