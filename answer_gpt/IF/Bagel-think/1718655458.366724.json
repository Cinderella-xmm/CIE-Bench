    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all spheres and cubes replaced with LEGO brick shapes that retain the original marbled patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects are seen as LEGO bricks that maintain the marbled patterns similar to those on spheres in the original Image A. This indicates that the transformation involves changing the shape while keeping the surface texture consistent, which aligns with the visual presentation of the LEGO bricks.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do all LEGO bricks have a matte surface texture without reflective highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When observing Image B closely, the LEGO bricks seem to have a matte surface, as there are no visible reflective highlights or glossy spots. They contrast with the original spheres in Image A, which display shine and reflections, indicating that the texture transformation results in a matte finish.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks arranged in an orderly, structured pattern on a wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO bricks placed on a wooden shelf in a somewhat random and unstructured manner, lacking an explicitly defined pattern. This arrangement contrasts with a neat, orderly structure, as the bricks appear to be stacked informally.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks display subtle interlocking details such as studs or recessed connectors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks visibly show the typical interlocking details expected of LEGO pieces, such as studs on the top surface and recessed connectors that allow them to connect with other bricks. This detailed aspect aligns with common LEGO design features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background simplified into a clean, uniform, and uncluttered minimalist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a wood-grain background that is relatively uniform and clean in appearance, creating a minimalist style. Unlike Image A's more complex scene with smaller fragments and varied background details, the wood shelf offers a simpler and uncluttered visual setting.",
