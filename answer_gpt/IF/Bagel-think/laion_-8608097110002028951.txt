    "Question": "Q1: Is the facade of the theater building constructed from visible tan LEGO bricks with brown accents?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the theater building facade appears to be constructed from tan colored LEGO bricks, which is evident from the distinctive texture and blocky appearance characteristic of LEGO pieces. The accents on the facade, such as around the windows and roofline, are rendered in brown, differentiating from the tan bricks and lending visual depth. This combination of colors matches typical LEGO construction styles, which often use color contrasts to emphasize architectural details.",
