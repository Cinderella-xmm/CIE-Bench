      "question": "Is the cityscape and car fully enclosed within a transparent, cube-shaped resin casing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual inspection reveals that the cityscape and car are indeed encased within a transparent, cube-shaped object. The edges and surfaces of this cube are clearly visible, and the scene is entirely enclosed within it. This implication reflects a common practice in art and design where objects are preserved or displayed within clear resin casings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car feature a sleek, futuristic design with metallic and highly reflective surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is depicted with a sleek and aerodynamic body, characteristic of futuristic design aesthetics. Its surface appears metallic and exhibits reflections indicative of a highly polished or reflective material. Such attributes are common in modern, high-performance vehicles aiming for an advanced and innovative look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers visibly reduced in size compared to the original image, enhancing the sense of depth and scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the skyscrapers appear smaller in scale due to being confined within a resin cube with additional perspectives. This leads to a miniaturized effect where buildings are scaled down relative to their original size in Image A, potentially enhancing a sense of depth due to the volumetric constraints of the cube.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the skyscrapers have small, distinct points of light resembling micro LEDs on their windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon visual inspection of Image B, the skyscrapers do not seem to display any small, distinct points of light resembling micro LEDs. The windows and building surfaces appear uniformly colored without distinct lit points. Such a feature would involve depicting multiple small illuminated spots, which is not evident here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the trees feature finely detailed, miniature foliage with rich green coloration that contrasts with the surrounding urban structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees exhibit rich green foliage that is miniature in scale, especially when compared to the surrounding buildings. The detailed representation of the leaves contrasts with the more monotone urban architecture, reflecting a common artistic technique to highlight natural elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the resin cube completely transparent with no visible color distortion or opacity, allowing full view of the interior scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The resin cube in Image B appears to be completely transparent, allowing an unobstructed view of the cityscape and car within. There is no visible color distortion or opacity that might obscure the internal features, aligning with the properties of clear resin used for encasing and displaying objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the car positioned in the same relative location on the street as in the original image, maintaining its orientation and alignment with the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comparing Image B to Image A, the car maintains the same relative position on the street in terms of orientation and alignment. It remains in a similar spot on the road within the cube as it does outside the cube, reflecting the image's intentional design to preserve spatial consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
