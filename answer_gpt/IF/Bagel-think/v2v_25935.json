      "question": "Is the entire urban street scene recreated using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements such as the cobblestone path and the buildings on either side of the street, along with the person in the center, appear constructed using Lego bricks. This observation is based on the distinctive appearance of Lego pieces, characterized by their blocky shape and modularity. Everything from the street's surface to the figures in the scene exhibits the typical plastic look and interlocking features of Lego bricks.",

      "question": "Are the cobblestones on the path represented using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the path consists of rounded and studded pieces that visually resemble Lego bricks. The distinctive round studs and the grid arrangement emulate cobblestones quite effectively in the Lego style. This representation aligns with the characteristics of Lego constructs, which typically use small, studded pieces to mimic textures.",

      "question": "Are the buildings in the background recreated using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B indicates that the buildings on both sides are built using extended vertical and horizontal Lego bricks. The bright, solid colors, rectangular shapes, and small brick details suggest typical Lego construction. These features are indicative of the modular and vibrant style associated with Lego bricks, rather than the realistic textures of actual buildings.",

      "question": "Is the man and his clothing, bag, and cap represented using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the person as a Lego figurine, characterized by the stylized blocky figure and simplified features typical of Lego characters. Both his clothing and accessories, like the bag and cap, are constructed from Lego components, recognizable by their simplified forms and solid colors typical of Lego attire and accessories.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the original composition and perspective of the urban street scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the transformation into Lego style in Image B, the composition and perspective of the original street scene in Image A, including the positioning of the person in the foreground and the receding street lined with buildings, are preserved. The angle and depth are effectively captured using Lego bricks, ensuring that the edited image maintains the original composition and perspective.",
