      "question": "Is the robot and its surroundings enclosed within a transparent glass bell jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot and its surroundings are clearly encapsulated within a distinct transparent structure resembling a glass bell jar. This is inferred from the visibility of a curved, transparent surface around the top and sides of the robot, which is typical of a glass enclosure. This kind of structure is often used for decorative or protective purposes.",

      "question": "Is the robot standing on a small pedestal decorated with cogs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is resting on a base, but the design details must be scrutinized to identify any cog decorations. The pedestal appears to have a complex design, with ornamental elements at its base. The presence of circular patterns resembling cogs can be noted, which aligns with common steampunk aesthetics, suggesting the use of cog designs.",

      "question": "Are there miniature clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils visible around the robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, aside from the robot itself, which features gear-like elements, there are no explicit external miniature clockwork gadgets or copper wire coils surrounding the robot. The area within the glass jar appears minimalistic beyond the main robot figure, focusing more on the robot than additional intricate devices.",

      "question": "Are there small glowing orbs present as decorative elements in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a small, clearly visible glowing orb placed prominently in front of the robot on the pedestal. The orb emits a noticeable glow, serving as a decorative component that enhances the visual appeal of the scene through its luminous contrast with the otherwise metallic and matte textures.",

      "question": "Are intricate steampunk-style patterns etched onto the base of the glass bell jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base supports the glass bell jar and displays ornate designs consistent with steampunk stylings, such as mechanical and industrial motifs. These can be identified through the lavish and intricate paneling at the base, which enhances the steampunk theme through textured and stylized etching.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the background display a rusted metal texture that complements the robotâ€™s antique bronze coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears relatively neutral and lacks explicit rusted metal texture, instead showing what might resemble a worn-out wooden or wall surface. It does not directly complement the robot's antique bronze coloration with a rusted metal theme, maintaining a more subdued and less visually dominant characteristic than the focus on the robot itself.",
