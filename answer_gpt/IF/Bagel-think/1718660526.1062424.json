      "question": "Is the animal composed of small, distinct ceramic tiles arranged to form its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the animal appears to be constructed from numerous small, distinct pieces resembling ceramic tiles arranged in a mosaic pattern to form its body. This conclusion is derived from the visible grid-like, segmented appearance and the glossy surface characteristic of ceramic tiles.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stripes made from glossy ceramic tiles in vibrant orange and deep black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes on the animal are clearly depicted using ceramic tiles. These tiles have a glossy finish and vibrant colors, specifically in shades of orange and deep black, which are typical of ceramic mosaic art. The shine and color contrast suggest the use of these materials and colors.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes and snout formed from precisely cut ceramic tiles that maintain their expressive appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes and snout of the animal in Image B are composed of ceramic tiles. Despite the geometric constraints of using tiles, these features are crafted in a way that retains a clear expressive quality, aided by careful tile placement and the inherent shine of the ceramic material which enhances their expressiveness.",

      "question": "Is the mosaic animal positioned on a surface with a visible sandy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the animal placed on a surface that exhibits a sandy texture. This is inferred from the grainy, uneven appearance of the ground, resembling natural sand in texture.",

      "question": "Is there a clear visual contrast between the smooth, glossy surface of the tiles and the rough, granular texture of the platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is a distinct visual contrast in Image B between the smooth, glossy finish of the ceramic tiles composing the animal and the rough, granular appearance of the sandy surface it is placed on. This contrast is emphasized by the reflectivity and sheen of the tiles compared to the matte, uneven texture of the sand.",
