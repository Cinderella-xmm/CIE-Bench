      "question": "Is the Funko Pop-style box shown in an isometric view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a Funko Pop-style box with a visible front and one side of the box. The box is angled so that you can see both the front and part of the side, which is characteristic of an isometric view, offering a 3D perspective where multiple sides can be seen simultaneously.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure of the baseball player hold a bat and wear a helmet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure is visually depicted holding a baseball bat in one hand and wearing a helmet, as indicated by the presence of both objects in the figure's hands and headgear. These elements are typical for a baseball-themed character, aligning with common traits for such figures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are a ball and glove included as signature elements accompanying the chibi-style figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the depiction shows a baseball held near the figure, but there is no glove present alongside it. Baseball figures commonly feature balls and gloves, but Image B clearly lacks the glove element.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a realistic depiction of the figure positioned outside of the box with detailed textures and lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure outside the box shows some shading and highlights, providing a stylized representation rather than realistic textures. The lighting appears consistent with the figure's cartoonish design, lacking the detailed textures and realistic lighting found in lifelike models.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Is the packaging titled \"BASEBALL LEGEND\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text on the front of the box in Image B reads \"BASEBALL LEEGAL,\" which differs from the phrase \"BASEBALL LEGEND.\" While it might be a whimsical play on words, the title visible does not match the given title.",
