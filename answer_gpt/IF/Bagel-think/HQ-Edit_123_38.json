    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image presented as part of a multi-panel postcard set with a gymnastics theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The second image features a single panel showing a gymnast in a contorted pose. The flat white background combined with decorative elements suggests an artistic representation rather than a multi-panel layout. Typically, multi-panel postcard sets would display several smaller sections within a larger frame.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The contortionist in Image B appears to have smooth, digital-like textures, which are characteristic of graphic arts. There are no visible brushstroke textures on the figure, as it is rendered in a vibrant and polished manner typical of vector illustrations.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the proportions of the contortionist, both the hands and body seem proportional. The hands are not exaggerated or enlarged in any visually significant way, and are consistent with the rest of the body’s scale.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The legs of the contortionist appear to be in proportion to the rest of the body, designed to portray realistic human anatomy involved in gymnastics. The overall body proportions seem natural, and there's no noticeable exaggeration in length.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is adorned with a color scheme predominantly featuring blue and silver. These gradients are applied in a way that enhances the visual contours and shapes of the gymnast's form, making them stand out.",
