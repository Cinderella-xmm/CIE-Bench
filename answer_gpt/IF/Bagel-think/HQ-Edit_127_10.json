      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical or dome-shaped structure resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly contained within a transparent, spherical structure that closely resembles a typical snow globe. This is evidenced by the shape, the clear material that forms a dome around the scene, and the presence of flake-like particles suspended within it, which are common elements of snow globes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the upper tier display a detailed Paris skyline composed of buildings with metallic textures or finishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the upper part, behind the Eiffel Towers, shows a series of tall buildings with a uniform dark gray color and texture that mimics metal. These buildings give the impression of a stylized skyline with a metallic finish, contributing to the overall theme of a snow globe cityscape.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the lower tier contain dense, vibrant green vegetation including trees, hedges, and garden elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a base with clusters of green elements which are depicted as trees and possibly hedges. They have a vibrant green color, common in representations of miniature gardens or parks within a contained environment like a snow globe.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the dome of Image B, there are numerous small, silvery or white dots suspended throughout the space, giving the appearance of particles floating about, which is typical in snow globes to simulate falling snow.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the scene in Image B shows a cobblestone path that extends in front of the Eiffel Towers. However, there are no visible street lamps, as the trees and towers dominate the scene.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays two Eiffel Towers placed side by side in the center of the snow globe, which is an unconventional but distinct feature of this miniature scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the scene exhibit characteristics of a miniature 3D model, such as exaggerated perspective, reduced scale, or model-like textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene within Image B exhibits characteristics typical of a miniature 3D model: the Eiffel Towers and surrounding buildings are shown in a reduced scale with exaggerated perspectives and stylized textures, creating a model-like appearance within the snow globe.",
