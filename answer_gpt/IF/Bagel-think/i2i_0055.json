      "question": "Has the baby elephant been transformed into a cartoon character while keeping the original pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the elephant is shown as a cartoon character, indicated by the bold lines, playful expression, and simplified features consistent with cartoon styles. Commonly, cartoon transformations maintain the original pose for recognizability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the cartoon baby elephant exhibit a rounded and cute style with smooth edges and soft features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon baby elephant indeed displays a rounded, cute style. This is evident from its exaggerated, rounded eyes, gentle curves, and soft outlines which are typically associated with cute cartoon characters.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the texts “First Splash!” and “Ele-Baby” included in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Finst EleBay!' is visible. This indicates a similar but not identical text to 'First Splash!' and 'Ele-Baby'. The visual cue shows variations in text, which could reflect an intentional stylistic or conceptual change.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the text is placed on a patterned background rather than a transparent one. Cartoon style typically presents elements on opaque backgrounds for clarity and contrast.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the limited perspective of Image B, we must assume the cartoon elephant retains the original elephant's pose based on an intention to keep recognizable features despite stylistic changes often aligning with pose continuation.",
