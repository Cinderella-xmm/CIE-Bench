      "question": "Do the dolls have bold calligraphic outlines around them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls are surrounded by bold, flowing lines akin to the style found in calligraphy or traditional ink drawings. This stylistic choice often emphasizes contours and shapes, giving the image a more graphic and illustrative appearance. The presence of these lines is a distinct departure from Image A, which depicted dolls without such outlines.",

      "question": "Are the dolls' clothing and hair depicted using flat planes of color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the dolls with flat colors used for clothing and hair, resembling a simplified or abstracted art style where color is applied in single, unshaded planes. This contrasts with the realistic textures and gradations in Image A.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the store environment been replaced with a subtly patterned, simplified background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detailed store setting from Image A has been substituted with a more abstract background that employs simplified patterns and muted colors, typical of artistic stylizations where unnecessary details are omitted to focus on the main subjects.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By analyzing Image B, we observe that despite the change in artistic style, the doll on the right remains posed as a ballet dancer with an outfit reminiscent of a tutu. This aligns with the ballet theme from Image A, represented through a different artistic interpretation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seated doll's position and attire appear consistent with those seen in Image A. The doll maintains its seated position with a pink top; the mat also retains a similar color, aligning with the fuchsia mat from the original image.",
