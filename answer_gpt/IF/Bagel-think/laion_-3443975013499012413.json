      "question": "Has the wooden material been replaced with transparent blue and teal crystalline material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the material of the sculpture is clearly depicted as transparent with a blue and teal crystalline appearance. This is evident from the clear reflections and the light passing through the material, which indicates it is made from a glass-like or crystal-like substance. In contrast, Image A shows a wooden carving, recognizable by its organic texture and lack of transparency.",

      "question": "Do the facets and angles of the sculpture accurately represent the fish's scales and curved body structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a fish sculpture where facets and angles are used to emulate the intricacies of a fish's scales and its curved body. The craftsmanship in Image B involves sharp geometric shapes and facets that mimic the natural details of a fish, such as overlapping scales and flowing fins. Image A shows the fish carved in wood with engraved lines to represent scales, but lacking the multifaceted precision seen in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the sculpture exhibit glossy, reflective surfaces that suggest water-like fluidity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the sculpture has glossy surfaces that reflect light, such as from the facets and transparent nature of the material. This glossy finish, combined with the reflective properties of the crystalline material, generates a visual impression akin to water-like fluidity. These qualities aren't present in Image A, which is a wooden carving with a matte finish, lacking reflective qualities.",

      "question": "Is the sculpture presented in a minimalist white gallery space with no visible distractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sculpture in a stark white environment, typical of a minimalist gallery setting, where the focus is solely on the art piece. There are no additional elements or distractions within the frame, supporting the minimalist presentation. This contrasts with Image A, where the background includes textured surfaces not typical of a gallery setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sculpture mounted on a sleek, mirrored pedestal that reflects its image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is placed on a pedestal that appears to have a sleek, mirror-like surface reflecting parts of the sculpture, which adds to the aesthetic. This reflection highlights the crystalline nature of the sculpture and enhances the visual impact by showing the sculpture's details from different angles. Image A does not feature a pedestal and is simply set on a surface without reflective qualities.",
