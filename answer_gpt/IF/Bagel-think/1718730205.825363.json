      "question": "Is the entire image, including the cosmic vortex and forest landscape, rendered in the style of a stained glass window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style distinctly resembles a stained glass window. The cosmic vortex, forest landscape, and all other elements are composed of segments divided by thick, black outlines, mimicking the appearance of lead cames in stained glass works. This characteristic gives the entire image the appearance of an intricate stained glass design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spiral patterns of the cosmic vortex are indeed outlined with thick, dark, continuous lines. These lines are reminiscent of the lead cames used to join pieces of stained glass in artistic windows, thus confirming the style typical of stained glass designs.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases vibrant and deep colors, especially within the sky and tree canopies.

      "question": "Do the surfaces of the stained glass elements (including the spiral and trees) exhibit angular, multi-faceted textures that simulate light refraction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the surfaces of the stained glass elements are composed of sections that mimic the angular, multi-faceted textures seen in traditional stained glass windows. These facets are designed to simulate the manner in which light refracts through the colored glass, a common characteristic of stained glass artistry.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not primarily feature soft, glowing light effects or smooth color transitions typical of a serene atmosphere. Instead, the image utilizes the segmented and vibrant visual style of stained glass, emphasizing hard lines and contrasts rather than smooth blends or tranquil lighting, which would typically evoke calmness and serenity.",
