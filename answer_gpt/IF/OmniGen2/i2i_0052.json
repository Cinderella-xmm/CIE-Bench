      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the players are designed with exaggerated features typical of chibi art style, such as large heads, small bodies, and simplified facial expressions.

        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the players are wearing tennis outfits with specific colors: one in blue and the other in red. Their hairstyles are styled simply, with one character having short hair and the other wearing a headband with a ponytail, which are common hairstyles for tennis players. Without the need for analysis based on Image A, these visual cues indicate that these outfits and hairstyles are consistent with typical tennis player aesthetics.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both players have tennis rackets visibly in their hands.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the two characters connecting via their exposed hands, with one hand from each character grasped together, which implies the action of a handshake. The positioning and gesture clearly demonstrate that the players are shaking hands.",
