      "question": "Is the hot dog replaced with a model made of red, yellow, and tan LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog is represented as a model built from LEGO bricks. The visible pieces include red, yellow, and tan colors, which mimic the colors typically found in a real hot dog, such as the bun and sausage. By analyzing the shapes and colors, it is clear that this is a LEGO construction, as it consists of interlocking brick patterns characteristic of LEGO toys.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the original bottle been replaced with a mosaic-style ceramic object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle seen in Image A is replaced by an object that resembles a LEGO model, rather than a mosaic-style ceramic object. This object is built from LEGO pieces in various colors, forming a structure that resembles the shape of a bottle. Mosaic-style ceramics typically consist of small, randomly arranged, colored tiles creating a pattern, which is not the case here.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mosaic ceramic piece feature geometric patterns in red, yellow, and tan colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a model made from LEGO bricks, which include geometric shapes and colors such as red, yellow, and tan. However, this object is not a mosaic ceramic piece and does not feature patterns typical of mosaic works, which are made from small, irregularly arranged tiles. The geometric pattern here comes from the deliberate construction using LEGO bricks, not mosaic tiles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both the LEGO hot dog and the mosaic ceramic piece placed on a smooth wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the LEGO hot dog and the object that replaces the bottle, built with LEGO bricks, are placed on a smooth wooden base. The base appears flat and polished, similar to a cutting board or display base.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the LEGO hot dog maintain an elongated, cylindrical shape similar to a real hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO hot dog is constructed in such a way that it emulates the elongated, cylindrical shape characteristic of a real hot dog. Despite being made of LEGO bricks, the deliberate alignment and choice of pieces contribute to maintaining a shape that closely resembles that of a traditional hot dog.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the mosaic ceramic piece have a rounded, artistic form rather than a realistic bottle shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object replacing the bottle is created from LEGO bricks and does not represent a mosaic ceramic piece. It maintains a somewhat blocky and artistic interpretation of a bottle rather than a realistic portrayal. Its form does have rounded aspects due to the limitations of LEGO bricks, but it cannot be described as a mosaic ceramic piece or a purely artistic form as typically understood in ceramic art.",
