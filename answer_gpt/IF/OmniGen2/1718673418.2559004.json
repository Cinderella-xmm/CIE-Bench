      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the island visibly floating above the water, disconnected from any land or water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the island is depicted as floating in the sky rather than being based in water, with its base clearly elevated above a bright blue background resembling air or sky rather than water. This gives the appearance of the island being suspended in the air, clearly disconnected from any land or water surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all building roofs replaced with mushroom-shaped canopies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although some mushroom-shaped objects are present, they are floating around the island and not serving as canopies on the building roofs. The buildings maintain traditional red-tiled roofs, which are distinct from the depicted mushrooms, indicating that not all roofs are replaced with mushroom canopies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the lake's reflection appear distorted, shimmering, or iridescent rather than a clear mirror image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an aerial view of a floating island, and thus lacks a body of water directly associated with reflections seen in Image A. Instead, the island is surrounded by sky, eliminating the possibility of a traditional water reflection; thus, there isn't a lake reflection to be assessed in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mountains in the background morphed into structures resembling giant tree roots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no mountains visible as the concept revolves around a suspended island in the sky. The surrounding features include primarily sky and clouds, and there's no inclination toward any mountain structures resembling giant tree roots.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible green vines connecting the buildings on the island?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a lush green island with some greenery around the buildings, but there appear to be no connecting green vines between the buildings. The buildings seem isolated concerning vines interconnecting them.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there colorful, translucent, or glowing bridges connecting the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridges visible are solid and made to resemble traditional bridges connecting two points, without evidence of being colorful, translucent, or glowing. They serve as typical structural connections rather than vivid or illuminated features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the boats replaced with leaf-shaped airships floating above pastel-colored clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are elements floating above the island that resemble airships. They take an aesthetic style that could be likened to fantastical or steampunk-like zeppelins, though they don't specifically resemble leaf shapes. The scene features pastel-colored clouds and sky, where these airships appropriate the role traditionally held by boats, appearing as futuristic replacements for water vessels.",
