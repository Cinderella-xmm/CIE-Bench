      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the object, resembling a cat, appears to be curled up. The body, legs, and tail of the cat are all positioned in a way that forms a circular or curled shape, indicating that the cat maintains a curled-up posture. This conclusion is drawn by examining the positioning of these body parts, which align with the characteristics of a curled-up position.",

      "question": "Is the cat's fur represented by simple gradient color blocks in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur of the cat is depicted using simple shapes and solid color blocks. There is minimal detail in the fur, and the color distribution appears to be more block-like rather than textured or detailed like actual fur. This simplified representation aligns with the use of gradient or solid color blocks, common in illustrations. By analyzing the visual styling, it is evident that such a design is employed here.",

      "question": "Has the car been simplified to a curved surface with only reflection lines present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals no visual representation of a car at all. The focus is primarily on showing the sticker or illustration of the curled-up cat itself. Therefore, there is no simplification of the car into curved surfaces with reflection lines visible. This absence of any car-related imagery indicates that the car has not been simplified to any such form in the edited version.",

      "question": "Does the sticker have an irregular shape with a thick white outline and a transparent background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sticker in Image B is irregularly shaped following the contours of the cat illustration while featuring a thick white outline that surrounds and defines the boundary of the cat's image. The space beyond this thick white line is seemingly transparent, which suggests that it is styled to be cut out, leaving the main design and the outline; hence, it meets the criteria described in the question.",

      "question": "Is the entire image styled in a minimalist illustration manner suitable for a chibi sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portrayal of the cat uses simplified forms, solid colors, and a lack of intricate details, consistent with minimalist or simplified illustration styles. Such design choices are typical for chibi stickers, which are characterized by cute, simplified, and exaggerated features. Through analyzing these stylistic characteristics, it is clear that the image fits the description of being styled in a minimalist way for a chibi sticker.",
