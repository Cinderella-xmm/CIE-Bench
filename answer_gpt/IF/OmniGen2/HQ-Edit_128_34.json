      "question": "Is the cityscape and car fully enclosed within a transparent, cube-shaped resin casing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car and part of the cityscape are seen inside a clear, cube-shaped casing. This indicates that the objects, including the car and the miniature cityscape, are encapsulated within this transparent structure. This observation, combined with the world knowledge of how resin models and casings are typically presented, confirms that the scenario fits within a cube-shaped casing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car feature a sleek, futuristic design with metallic and highly reflective surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The car in Image B displays a streamlined and modern design, similar to futuristic vehicles seen in concept car designs, with shiny, metallic surfaces reflecting their surroundings. This observation aligns with common depictions of futuristic cars known for their sleek, aerodynamic lines and reflective exteriors.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers visibly reduced in size compared to the original image, enhancing the sense of depth and scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers appear as part of a model inside a resin cube, making them significantly smaller relative to their depiction in Image A. The reduction in size is apparent as they fit within a compact display case, thereby changing the perception of depth and scale.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the skyscrapers have small, distinct points of light resembling micro LEDs on their windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skyscrapers in Image B show illuminated windows with small lights that resemble micro LEDs, which is a design choice often used in scaled-down models to simulate real-life building illumination. This visual element contributes to the futuristic and miniaturized aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the trees feature finely detailed, miniature foliage with rich green coloration that contrasts with the surrounding urban structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are depicted as highly detailed miniatures with a vibrant green color. This adds a natural contrast to the industrial and urban elements of the model, a common technique used to enhance visual appeal in dioramas and models.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the resin cube completely transparent with no visible color distortion or opacity, allowing full view of the interior scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The resin cube in Image B appears entirely clear and transparent, providing an unobstructed view of the car and cityscape inside. This transparency is typical of display cases designed to showcase enclosed items without visual interference caused by color distortion or opaqueness.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the car positioned in the same relative location on the street as in the original image, maintaining its orientation and alignment with the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comparing the placements, the car in Image B is situated within a model diorama environment rather than a street as in Image A. Its positioning in Image B suggests a new context as it is placed on a grassy display base, thus not holding the same relative position to the street as seen in Image A.",
