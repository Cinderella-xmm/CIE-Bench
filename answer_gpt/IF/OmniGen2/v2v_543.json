      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures exhibit a chibi style, characterized by exaggeratedly small and cute proportions, larger heads compared to their bodies, and more cartoon-like features, which is typical for a 3D cartoon representation. This style contrasts with Image A, where the individuals maintain normal human proportions. The transformation into chibi-style characters indicates the use of artistic techniques to create a more playful and adorable representation.",

      "question": "Are the characters dressed in vibrant and festive winter attire inspired by traditional Chinese designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the characters wearing colorful attire that resembles traditional Chinese clothing.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the attire of the characters prominently features red and gold, which are traditional colors in Chinese culture representing luck and prosperity. Additionally, some characters are wearing blue headpieces, thereby incorporating these specific hues into their outfits. In contrast, Image A shows individuals in more muted and practical winter clothing without these vibrant and contrasting color schemes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the clothing of some characters displays embroidered motifs resembling dragons, which are common in traditional Chinese garments. Dragons and phoenixes are symbolic in Chinese culture, often used in festive and ceremonial attire to convey power and high status. Image A, on the other hand, displays no such intricate designs on the clothing, as it consists of typical winter sports gear.",

      "question": "Has the snowy forest backdrop been replaced with a celebratory scenery featuring “囍” paper-cut decorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes elements indicative of celebration, such as the decorative red “囍” symbol, which signifies double happiness and is commonly used in Chinese celebrations. The presence of these decorations in Image B transforms the original snowy forest scene from Image A into one filled with festivity and cultural significance. The inclusion of red lanterns further emphasizes this festive change.",
