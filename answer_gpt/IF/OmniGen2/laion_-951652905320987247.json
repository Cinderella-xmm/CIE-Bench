      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible glass terrarium structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate that the entire scene is encapsulated within a glass structure. The clear, reflective surface, along with the spherical shape, suggest that the display is inside a glass terrarium. Common knowledge about terrariums includes them being glass containers that house miniature landscapes, which aligns with the scene depicted. Therefore, based on the depiction within Image B, the scene is within a visible glass terrarium structure.",

      "question": "Are the snow-capped peaks made of visibly textured and glittering materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual observation in Image B, the snow-capped peaks have a textured appearance suggestive of being crafted from a material intended to imitate snow. The detailing on these peaks often involves a sparkling effect to simulate the reflection of light on snow, which can be seen here. These cues indicate the scene's snow is made from visibly textured and possibly glittering materials to enhance the synthetic representation of a winter landscape.",

      "question": "Does the landscape feature intricately detailed, fine-brushed foliage instead of natural-looking vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases trees that do not exhibit the intricate detail or natural randomness found in real-life vegetation. Instead, they have a uniformly textured and styled appearance, consistent with model or synthetic foliage crafted for aesthetic display. This style is characteristic of miniature representations, indicating the use of finely detailed, brush-like foliage.",

      "question": "Is the lake represented by a reflective, translucent resin-like surface with a synthetic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lake in Image B has a surface that appears smooth with a reflective quality, suggesting it is crafted from materials like resin, commonly used to simulate water in miniature setups. This synthetic sheen gives a similar reflective effect found in crafted model landscapes. Thus, the lake is accurately described as having a resin-like synthetic appearance.",

      "question": "Are there small, detailed chalet figurines placed along the shoreline of the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible small structures positioned beside the lake that closely resemble chalet or cabin-like figurines. These show detailing in their design, characteristic of diminutive replicas. Such placement along the shoreline is typical in model landscapes to create a picturesque scene, validating their identification as chalet figurines.",
