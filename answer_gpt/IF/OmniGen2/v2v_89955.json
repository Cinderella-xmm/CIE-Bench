      "question": "Does the bird's design align well with the natural lines and creases of the palm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the bird's design being intricate and stylized, it does not conform or align with the natural lines and creases of the palm. The bird appears as a separate entity with its own distinct design, which does not seamlessly integrate into the creases or natural markings of the hand. This indicates a lack of alignment with the palm's natural contours.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A with Image B, in Image A, the bird is drawn directly on the skin and positioned centrally within the palm. In contrast, Image B presents the bird as a separate decorative entity resting on the palm, yet positioned similarly within the central area of the hand. This suggests that the bird remains in the same relative position as the original image regarding the palm's center.",
