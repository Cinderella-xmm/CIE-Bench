      "question": "Is the overall image styled as a comic book cover with a dynamic layout and narrative framing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays three robotic figures standing behind large batteries, and the title 'Duraceell Power Preserve Adventures!' is shown in stylized typography akin to comic book covers. The inclusion of cartoon-like robots and a vibrant cityscape background contributes to a dynamic and narrative atmosphere, reminiscent of comic book storytelling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the four batteries depicted as robot characters with human-like features (e.g., arms, legs, heads) while preserving their copper and black color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the batteries are in the foreground, the robots depicted are behind them and separate from the batteries themselves. The robotic figures have heads and arms, but the batteries retain their original shape as cylinders, without human-like features such as limbs or facial elements. Instead, the robots provide a thematic background rather than transforming the batteries themselves into characters.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robots depicted in Image B have a sleek metallic design, with angular features and shiny textures that are consistent with futuristic and techno-themed art. These elements spread throughout the composition add to the bold, mechanical aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the title \"Duracell Guardians: Power Preserve Adventures!\" prominently displayed in a bold, comic-style font at the top or center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title reads 'Duraceell (misspelled) Power Preserve Adventures!' in bold text across the top of the image. However, it does not contain the specific title 'Duracell Guardians: Power Preserve Adventures!' asked about in the question, which affects correct answer judgments.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B shows a cityscape with tall buildings and a gradient orange sky, which could be interpreted as holographic due to the futuristic context provided by the robotic figures and the sci-fi imagery. The orange hue sets a futuristic tone consistent with holographic visual styles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature the text “10 Years in Storage” prominently on any digital screen or interface element as described in the question. Instead, the main text relating to the storyline centers around 'Power Preserve Adventures!' without specific storage guarantees.",
