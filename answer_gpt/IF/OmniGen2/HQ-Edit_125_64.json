      "question": "Has the Sphinx’s head been replaced with a radiant sun disc featuring visible hieroglyphic patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a golden statue with a sun disc behind its upper body featuring visible hieroglyphs. While this resembles the description of a sun disc with hieroglyphic patterns, it is not directly replacing the Sphinx’s head from Image A, as the settings differ. Thus, the described scenario does not exactly match Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there shimmering golden wings extending from both sides of the Sphinx’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a golden statue with extended wings, which could be interpreted as the Sphinx having wings in this context. However, since the setup in Image B differs entirely from that of Image A, involving a statue rather than a background-integrated Sphinx, the scenario described does not reflect the edited attributes of the Sphinx itself.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the limbs of the Sphinx show flowing desert sands cascading downward from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts a statue standing on desert sands. However, there is no visualization of sands flowing from the limbs themselves. Rather, the statue stands amidst static sand, lacking any cascading effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there ankhs glowing in azure color located on the paws of the Sphinx?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a golden statue holding two blue ankh-like objects in each hand, which could reflect the concept of azure-colored ankhs. However, they are not positioned on paws but are held by hands, hence the scenario does not match the described situation for the Sphinx.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the Sphinx still positioned in the same location relative to the background elements (such as the pyramid and sunset), with the sun disc correctly placed where the head was?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is entirely different, featuring a statue in a desert environment, without the pyramid or sunset directly involved. The sun disc in Image B is not related to the original Sphinx's head, as the settings are fundamentally different, not reflecting the same positioning or elements replacement.",
