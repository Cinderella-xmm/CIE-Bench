      "question": "Are the pastries depicted with exaggerated, bright colors and bold outlines characteristic of pop art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries are shown with highly saturated colors and distinct black outlines, which align with the pop art style. This art style is known for its vibrant, high contrast colors and defined lines to emphasize the subject, making it resemble commercial advertising. These exaggerated elements turn the pastries from realistic food items into stylized art representations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the bread slices feature bold outlines and vivid, non-naturalistic colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bread slices in Image B are depicted with strong outlines that separate them from the background. They are painted in bright hues that don't match real bread colors, which is a hallmark of pop art known for using vivid, sometimes discordant colors to create a lively and whimsical effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the muffin liners replaced with distinct geometric patterns such as triangles, squares, or other regular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no muffin liners visible. Instead, the image consists of elements that include geometric shapes like triangles and semi-circles around the pastries. This kind of abstraction blur replaces the realistic appearance of muffin liners with artful geometric designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wooden trays replaced with a checkerboard pattern of alternating colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden trays visible in Image A have been removed entirely, and there is no checkerboard pattern that replaces them. Instead, the background and other objects are transformed into colorful geometric shapes, but not specifically into a checkerboard pattern.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements seen in Image A, such as cups, are not present. Instead, the entire background has been transformed into an assemblage of abstract shapes filled with vibrant colors that don't resemble cups or any specific objects, consistent with an abstract pop art style.",
