      "question": "Is the car and coastal road enclosed within a transparent glass display case with visible edges and reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car and coastal road are clearly enclosed within a transparent glass display case. The presence of reflective edges and the distinct transparency of the case structure suggest the contents are protected within. World knowledge of display cases, typically used to showcase models or landscapes, confirms that this setup is common for highlighting intricate designs while protecting them.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car exhibit metallic red coloring with visible gradient hues across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car features a metallic red finish. The surface reveals gradient hues that shift subtly due to light reflection—this appearance indicates a metallic paint often used to create a dynamic and visually appealing effect. World knowledge about car paints and finishes suggests gradient hues are typically visible on metallic surfaces because of their reflective qualities.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible dynamic curves and sharp detail lines present on the car’s bodywork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car has pronounced dynamic curves and sharp detail lines across its bodywork, visible in the contours and design lines that augment its aerodynamic and stylistic appearance. World knowledge of sports car design emphasizes these features as they contribute to performance as well as aesthetic appeal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the road and cliffs appear to be constructed from layered resin, showing visible stratification and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition of the road and cliffs within the display case reflects layered resin construction. The stratification and depth are evident and suggest a sculpted design to simulate natural geological layers. World knowledge of model making and dioramas often involves layered resin to mimic natural landscapes and add depth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are micro gravel textures visibly embedded in the road and cliff surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road and cliff surfaces display micro gravel textures, which are consistent with common techniques used in dioramas to enhance realism. The textured surfaces indicate a level of detailed craftsmanship aimed at replicating authentic terrain. Knowledge of model terrain construction often includes using textures to simulate natural conditions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a sunset sky panel placed at the top of the display case, forming part of the diorama’s upper boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top section of the display case includes a sunset sky panel. This panel gives an illusion of depth and completes the scenic backdrop of the diorama. World knowledge of diorama construction frequently incorporates sky or environmental backgrounds to enhance immersion and add to the setting’s realism.",
