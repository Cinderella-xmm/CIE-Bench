        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents the scientist in a cartoonish style, typical of chibi or sticker designs, which often features characters with exaggerated proportions such as oversized eyes and soft facial features to create a cute appearance. The visual cues, such as large eyes, rounded forms, and simplified detailing, support the conclusion that the scientist has oversized eyes and soft facial features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, each of the six poses shows a scientist wearing a white lab coat over a light blue shirt. This is consistent across all the cartoon figures, depicting a uniform attire that is commonly associated with scientists and lab work.",

      "question": "Is the background bright green with hexagonal patterns or chemical formula motifs, leaving some blank white space around each sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the edited image is a bright green color with patterns that resemble hexagonal chemical structures or formula motifs. This background design is fitting for a scientific theme, and each sticker has a white outline creating a blank space that separates it from the bright green background, giving it a sticker-like appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "In one of the poses, is the scientist holding a beaker filled with a bubbling, vibrant liquid and wearing a curious expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "One of the poses in the edited image shows the scientist character holding a beaker that appears to be filled with a bubbling, vibrant liquid. This aligns with typical depictions of scientists conducting experiments. However, the expression is less evident due to the character design style prioritizing uniform facial traits.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all six stickers designed with an aspect ratio of 9:16?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of the stickers in the edited image does not conform to a 9:16 aspect ratio. The stickers are cartoonish figures with varying proportions tailored specifically to the chibi style, not adhering to the rectangular or elongated aspect ratio like 9:16. The focus is on the individual poses of the character rather than occupying a strict aspect ratio typical for screens.",
