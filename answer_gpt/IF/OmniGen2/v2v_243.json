        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects presented are skis with colorful patterns and hockey sticks with a wooden texture. There is no indication of these items being transformed into wearable footwear, as they still retain their original shapes and functions. Therefore, the objects have not been redesigned into footwear.",

      "question": "Are the vivid patterns from the original skis and hockey sticks incorporated into the new footwear design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skis retain their vivid patterns, which are clearly visible. However, since the question implies a transformation into footwear, and no such footwear is presented, there is no incorporation of patterns into a new footwear design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows hockey sticks with a wooden texture, but they remain in their original form as hockey sticks, and there is no indication of these textures being used in any footwear design. Therefore, the wooden textures are not incorporated into a new footwear design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts skis and hockey sticks in their standard forms and does not show any footwear. Without any footwear present in the image, there cannot be an imaginative form considered that reflects the original designs.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B does not show any redesigned footwear, but rather retains the original forms of skis and hockey sticks, any question about unconventional materials in a nonexistent footwear design is moot.",
