    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible traditional Japanese painting brush strokes on the baseball bat and grass?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the application of color and lines does not appear to mimic traditional Japanese brush strokes. Instead, it uses flat colors and outlines which are characteristic of printed art, similar to Ukiyo-e prints rather than brushwork. Traditional Japanese brushwork typically involves visible, deliberate brush strokes and textural variety, which are not present here.",

    "Question": "Q3: Have the shapes of the baseball bats and grass been maintained while adapting to the Ukiyo-e style?",
