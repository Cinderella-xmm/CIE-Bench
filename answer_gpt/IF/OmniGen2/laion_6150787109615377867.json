      "question": "Has the tabletop been replaced with a gear-shaped component featuring visible teeth and intricate engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table's top is not gear-shaped. Instead, it is round with intricate engravings on the surface. There are no teeth typically associated with gear shapes visible around the edge of the tabletop. My analysis is based on observing the visual characteristics of the tabletop in Image B, drawing on knowledge of gear components which would typically feature teeth along the perimeter.",

      "question": "Have the table legs been morphed into articulated, piston-driven limbs with visible joints and brass or copper-colored accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table does have legs with copper-colored accents, and there appears to be additional mechanical features near the central column that resemble pistons. While the legs themselves don't resemble explicitly articulated limbs with joints, the overall construction with visible gears gives a more mechanical and articulated appearance compared to basic table legs. Therefore, combining the visual cues with common mechanical features, this suggests a transformation into a form that resembles articulated, piston-driven morphology.",

      "question": "Are there visible steam vents placed along the central column of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the central column contains several mechanical elements and features typical of steampunk aesthetics, such as dials and pressure gauges. However, there are no explicit steam vents visible. Steam vents would be expected to have openings designed to release steam. Based on the visual analysis, such features are not present.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the base feature intricate cog patterns and at least one rotating dial or gauge element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the base of the table displays intricate designs, including mechanical-like components that suggest cog patterns. There are also visible circular elements that resemble buttons or gauges on the central column. This aligns with common elements found in steampunk-inspired designs, and thus suggests the presence of these features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the metal table been transformed into a coherent, steampunk-style mechanized creature with integrated mechanical features resembling a living machine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the table extensively reimagined with features characteristic of steampunk design, including brass-like materials, gears, gauges, and complex mechanical components. By combining these visual cues with the notion of a mechanized creature, it reflects the aesthetics of a living machine, a common theme in steampunk, transforming the standard table into a stylized machine. Therefore, it fits the concept of a coherent steampunk-style mechanized entity.",
