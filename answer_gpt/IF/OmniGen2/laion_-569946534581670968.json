      "question": "Are the chicken wings replaced with plush toy replicas made of golden-brown fabric that have a slightly crunchy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects visually resembling chicken wings are shown with a very simple, uniform, and smooth texture, akin to fabric. They appear to be solid orange in color, without any shading or realistic variations, indicating they are not actual chicken wings but more like plush toy replicas. The common visual cue of a 'crunchy texture' is missing due to the uniform coloring and lack of detail.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sauce replaced with a soft, textured pillow in bright orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B that resembles a sauce dish contains a uniform, bright orange area without visual details that resemble the consistency or texture of sauce. It appears smooth and flat, lacking in variation and texture, which suggests itâ€™s a stylized or simplified representation, possibly likened to a flat surface or a simple pillow shape.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the entire scene set on a smooth, light-colored wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background surface appears to be uniformly light-colored and smooth, which is characteristic of a wooden surface. This is in contrast to Image A, where the surface was darker. The choice of a light hue and its smooth texture in Image B supports the interpretation of a light-colored wooden surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the plush wings and the orange pillow arranged in the same spatial configuration as the original chicken wings and sauce?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A comparison of Image B with Image A shows that both the plush wings and the orange pillow in Image B maintain the same relative positions and spatial layout as the chicken wings and sauce in Image A. The top-down view and the arrangement into a circular display remain consistent, indicating that despite the change in appearance, the spatial configuration is identical.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the plush wings and pillow clearly appear as fabric-based toys rather than real food items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects replacing the chicken wings and sauce exhibit a uniform color and lack the detailed texture typical of real food. The texture appears smooth and the shapes simplified, suggesting a fabric-like or fictional quality akin to plush toys. Their non-realistic presentation is a visual departure from that of genuine food items.",
