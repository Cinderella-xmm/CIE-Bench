      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pelican rendered in a cartoon-style with simplified and exaggerated features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican is depicted with characteristics typical of a cartoon style: simplified shapes and exaggerated features. The eyes are unusually large, and the overall form of the pelican appears more rounded and less detailed than a realistic depiction, such as one having fine details of actual feathers.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the pelican’s beak been visibly exaggerated in size or shape compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican’s beak is rendered in an exaggerated manner, distinctly larger and more prominent than what would be anatomically proportional in real life. This style exaggeration is common in cartoon illustrations to emphasize distinct features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the pelican are depicted as very large and bulging, a common practice in cartoon art to create a whimsical or comedic effect. This style differs significantly from the more proportionate realism seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pelican’s feathers colored in vivid pastel shades such as soft pinks, blues, or lavenders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's feathers are depicted in striking pastel colors, with evident tones of blue. This choice of color is characteristic of a more imaginative and playful design approach, differing from the natural coloration in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the feather textures from the original image preserved in the edited version, even if colors are changed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's feathers are represented with flat, stylized renderings rather than the detailed textural quality seen in Image A. The cartoon style opts for flatter colors and simpler shapes over detailed texturing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a sailor hat placed on top of the pelican’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a sailor hat on top of the pelican’s head, which adds to its whimsical character and is not present in the original realistic Image A. The addition of this element contributes to the cartoonish and nautical theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background now a muted wooden plank surface instead of grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background of wooden planks, replacing the grassy environment in Image A. This change focuses on the central character (the pelican) and fits the nautical theme by suggesting a deck or boardwalk setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering the cartoon style, exaggerated features, vivid pastel coloration, and the addition of a sailor's hat, Image B conveys a whimsical and nautical theme. Such imagery is suitable for decorative items like fridge magnets, which often adopt lighthearted and imaginative designs.",
