        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background that resembles a map in Image A has been entirely transformed into a ceramic mosaic tile featuring colorful tiles arranged in various patterns and designs.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a ceramic mosaic tile artwork with distinct geometric patterns composed of various shapes such as flowers, squares, and circles, coming together to form complex designs with different colors.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparing both images, Image B retains the positioning of the pins similar to Image A, although the pins' colors and arrangement differ, showing a transformation. This indicates that while the layout has been altered in design, the fundamental positioning remains consistent.",
