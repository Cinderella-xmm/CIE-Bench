    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire bottle constructed entirely from LEGO bricks, with no realistic glass or plastic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle appears smooth and has a consistent surface texture characteristic of a typical glass or plastic material. There are no visible LEGO brick seams or textures to suggest a construction from LEGO. The reflection and shadow effects mimic those of a conventional transparent bottle material rather than plastic bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the body and sides of the bottle built using translucent green LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a smooth, consistent green coloration that resembles a uniformly dyed or coated material. The typical texture, interlock seams, or translucency of LEGO bricks are absent, which suggests it is not constructed from LEGO bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the label area composed of multicolored LEGO blocks representing the original design elements (logo, text, colors)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label on the bottle in Image B appears smooth and cohesive as one printed piece rather than made of separate LEGO blocks. The logo, text, and colors are finely detailed and aligned, which would be difficult to achieve with LEGO blocks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cap made from smooth, circular blue LEGO bricks and does it maintain a cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap in Image B is a consistent blue color without exhibiting the characteristic bumps or interlocking design typical of LEGO construction. It appears smooth and cylindrical, maintaining the appearance of a conventional bottle cap rather than being constructed from LEGO bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO bottle placed on a minimalist white shelf against a neutral or white background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bottle resting on a plain white shelf with a neutral background, reflecting a minimalist and simple presentation. However, there are no indications that the bottle itself is a LEGO model.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all brand texts (e.g., \"Bacardi,\" \"Mojito,\" \"Classic Cocktails\") visibly rendered in blocky LEGO-style lettering and legible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text on the bottle in Image B appears to be printed and not constructed from blocks. While legible, it does not exhibit the blocky or pixelated texture that would characterize LEGO-style lettering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the LEGO bottle display clear sculptural features such as defined edges, depth, and 3D form to emphasize its construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show sculptural features characteristic of LEGO construction, such as defined edges or block segmentation. The bottle maintains the smooth, continuous form resembling a typical consumer bottle, lacking the 3D form indicative of LEGO assembly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
