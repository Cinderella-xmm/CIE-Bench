      "question": "Does the elephant appear as a 3D chibi-style desktop figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the elephant is depicted within a transparent dome, and its proportions appear exaggerated with a compact, rounded body style typical of chibi designs. Such styling is indicative of 3D figurines, often used as collectibles or decorative items. The details align with a chibi-style interpretation, which includes a disproportionally large head and a cuter, cartoonish appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is standing on a grassy base with no other interactive elements like grass to suggest any activity such as eating. Its pose is static, with a slight stance that does not involve any object interaction, unlike the grass-eating posture observed in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the base mimic muddy terrain with \"Jungle Friend\" engraved around the edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the figurine is depicted as smooth, with a green grass-like texture. The base has ‘Jungle Friend’ text engraved, indicating this figurine perhaps represents a playful or friendly jungle theme. However, there is no muddy terrain depicted; instead, a polished, clean base is utilized for display purposes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine appears to be made of a matte material that matches common chibi-style items. Typical materials for such items include polymer clay due to its ability to hold vibrant colors and fine details, while the dome looks transparent and smooth, consistent with acrylic material often used to encase decorative items.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The style in Image B is presented in a manner typical of product photography: the figurine is centrally placed and well-lit, with a clear focus on the product itself. The composition uses professional, staged elements such as the engraved base and dome to highlight the figurine, consistent with a clean, marketable display intended to entice viewers and buyers.",
