      "question": "Does the edited image depict the mountain range as a mythical beast with identifiable features such as a head, body, or limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain range appears altered with artistic enhancements that give it a more abstract and stylized appearance, but it does not form any identifiable features such as a head, body, or limbs of a mythical beast. The edited effects create a more dramatic texture and color contrast, but they do not convey clear anthropomorphic or zoomorphic forms. Thus, the mountain does not appear as a mythical beast with detailed anatomical features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the two highest peaks appear as large, curved, horn-like structures emerging from the top of the mythical beast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The two highest peaks in Image B have been visually enhanced with sharper contrasts and vibrant colors, which give them a pronounced and striking look. However, these enhancements do not transform the peaks into horn-like structures. The peaks retain their natural, rugged mountain form and lack the curved, tapering shape typical of horns. Therefore, they do not appear as horn-like structures.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rocky surfaces of the mountains visibly altered to resemble a textured hide, such as scaly or rugged skin-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features increased contrast and saturation, which accentuate the natural rugged texture of the mountains. The enhancements create a more dynamic and pronounced appearance, yet the surface does not distinctly imitate a hide with scaly or skin-like patterns. The rocky surfaces continue to resemble natural geological formations rather than an animalistic texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible mossy patterns and root-like structures along the mountain slopes that resemble tangled fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays enhanced colors and intensified contrasts that highlight the natural vegetation on the mountain slopes. However, they do not form patterns or structures that resemble fur. The visual changes increase the vividness of the colors, but the slopes do not exhibit fur-like qualities. They still represent typical vegetation patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the valleys been transformed into sinewy, muscular structures that follow the natural contours of the land but resemble biological musculature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the valleys' colors and shadows have been amplified, giving them a more dramatic and pronounced appearance. Nonetheless, these visual enhancements do not create sinewy, muscular structures that mimic biological musculature. The edited imagery accentuates the landscape's natural contour without morphing it into muscle-like formations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible earthy aura surrounding or emanating from the mythical beast, such as warm tones, glowing mist, or ambient light suggesting an organic, natural presence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features enhanced saturation and contrast, bringing out warm earthy tones and brighter highlights. This creates a more vibrant and lively atmosphere, emphasizing the organic colors of nature. While the enhancements do impart a slight mystical aesthetic, the aura is not specifically earthy or only associated with a mythical presence, rather, it is the result of color saturation.",
