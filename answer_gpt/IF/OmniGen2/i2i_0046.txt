    "Question": "Q1: Does the image have a white border surrounding it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a white border is clearly visible around the entire image.

}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the caption “11:13 AM” visible at the bottom within the white border?",
    "explanation": "In the edited Image B, a caption reading '11:13 AM' is clearly visible at the bottom within the white border. The inclusion of time captions is common in styles that emulate instant photography, like Polaroids, which often include timestamps.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Has the faded effect been applied to the entire image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skater appears darker and less contrasted compared to traditional images, suggesting the use of a vignette or a faded effect, especially noticeable in corners and edges, which are characteristic of such effects. The overall image appears less vibrant than a fresh photograph.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the image have a paper-like grain texture applied to it?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show a visible paper-like grain texture. The skater and background elements have a smooth appearance, lacking the fine speckles or patterns typical of grainy or textured photographic prints.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the original composition and elements of the image preserved, aside from the added white border, caption, faded effect, and grain texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central subject remains a skater in mid-air, which aligns with the original composition of Image A. Despite the presence of a white border, a caption, and the faded effect, the composition and main elements like the skater and skateboard are preserved as they originally appear in Image A without alterations in their placements or shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
