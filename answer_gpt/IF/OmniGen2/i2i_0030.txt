    "Question": "Q1: Is the original fruit platter photo used as the centerpiece without significant alterations?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fruit platter is prominently featured at the center of what appears to be product packaging.

No significant alterations like color changes, rearrangement, or distortion of proportions are evident. Therefore, the same photo appears to be used without significant changes.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the background styled with a light green gradient?",
