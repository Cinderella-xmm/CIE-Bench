      "question": "Has the spiral staircase been fully replaced by a serpent-shaped form that follows the same helical path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a large serpent occupying part of the staircase path, but the original structure of the staircase is still visible around it. The serpent seems to be emerging from or integrating with the staircase but doesn't fully replace it. It maintains a similar helical path as the staircase. In comparison to Image A, where the spiral staircase is uninterrupted, Image B retains some elements of the original structure while introducing the serpent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the serpent’s body feature detailed lattice-like scales across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent is depicted with a highly detailed texture of scales running across its surface. These scales can be described as lattice-like due to their distinct, interlocking pattern. The attention to detail and the structure of the scales are evident and prominent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the serpent’s body extended downward in a way that visually replicates the step-like descent of the original staircase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's body does not replicate the step-like form of a traditional staircase. Instead, it is coiled and curves in a smooth, continuous way. It does not have the horizontal surfaces that would reflect the step-like descent of a staircase as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are ornate, filigree-like patterns present on the serpent’s body, matching the style of the original railing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the serpent is textured with scales, it does not exhibit the ornate filigree-like patterns that are present on the original railing in Image A. The patterns on the railing in Image A are intricate and decorative, which are not mirrored on the serpent’s body.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the banister been replaced with a series of delicate, translucent fins along the serpent’s side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original banister with ornate designs can still be seen alongside the serpent. There are no translucent fins along the serpent’s side that would replace or mimic the banister. The railing remains an integral part of the staircase.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a serpent’s head positioned at the uppermost point of the spiral, featuring two distinct luminescent gem-like eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's head is indeed positioned prominently at the upper part of the staircase. The head is crafted with intricate details, and its eyes are particularly notable due to their glowing, gem-like appearance, suggesting a fascination with the mystical or fantastical elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the serpent’s body display a marble-like texture with visible veining and polished surface characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent in Image B is depicted with a texture that mimics scales rather than a marble-like finish. It does not have the veining or polished surface characteristics typical of marble. This is in contrast to the steps of the staircase, which do have a marble-like appearance.",
