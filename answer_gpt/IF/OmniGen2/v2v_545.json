      "question": "Is the sparrow depicted in a 3D-rendered form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow has smooth textures, uniform lighting, and an appearance that suggests computer-generated 3D modeling instead of a photograph. The rounded edges, consistent shadows, and overall style hint at a 3D-rendered representation, typically seen in digital art or animated films.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit the animation style characteristic of Pixar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sparrow and chair in Image B have a clean, polished appearance, similar to the style found in Pixar animations. These animations often feature high-quality rendering, a slightly exaggerated animation style, and a lively color palette. The visual cues in the image align with these characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the sparrow perched on the wooden chair in a realistic manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sparrow in Image B is depicted with a 3D-rendered form, which may focus more on aesthetics and style than realism. The smoothness and lack of fine natural details make it less realistic compared to real-life depictions of sparrows. It is more stylized and polished than realistic.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the sparrow and the chair exhibit highly smooth and refined textures, indicative of polished 3D rendering. These textures are clean, with a high level of detail and finish, portraying an idealized version typical of high-quality CGI models.",
