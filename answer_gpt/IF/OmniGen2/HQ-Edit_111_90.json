      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly encased in a transparent glass dome, which is visually identifiable by the reflections and contours seen on the surface.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the object suspended from the top resembles a chandelier, indicated by its design with multiple light-like structures branching out and the decorative objects hanging from it.
