      "question": "Is the athlete depicted in anime-style, with attention to sporty details like attire and accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the athlete is illustrated with bright and exaggerated colors typical for anime-style art. The rendering emphasizes contours and lighting effects on her attire, such as the bright red sporty outfit and shoes, which align with common presentations of anime characters, where outfits often highlight athletic capabilities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the athlete's pose been kept the same as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the athlete's pose is a low squat with her arms reaching towards the ground, holding a tennis racket. This pose, typical in tennis preparation, remains unchanged between the two images. The emphasis in the edited image is on stylization rather than repositioning.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the athlete have enhanced facial expressions with focused eyes and light effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows enhanced effects around the athlete, with perhaps intensified facial expressions suggested through style elements like accentuated lighting and color. However, the face details are notably blurred, so specific enhancements on facial expressions cannot be fully assessed, just the light effects indicating an intense focus.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible energy glow added to the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there seems to be a warm glow effect surrounding the athlete, suggesting the addition of energy elements. Such effects are typical in anime-style artwork to convey motion or intensity, which aligns with the visual backdrop and lighting enhancements.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has stylized elements, such as the lighting and anime-style illustration, which are typically seen in character card banners used in games and media. However, without additional features like text or banners at the top/bottom, it slightly diverges from typical character card formats. It focuses more on the anime-style depiction without clear banner or card framing.",
