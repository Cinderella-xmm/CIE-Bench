      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the original scanner completely replaced by a box-shaped packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object shown is clearly a box with graphical elements typical of packaging designs. The traditional contours and features of a scanner aren't visible. Through common sense, when a box displays graphics and branding elements, it is typical of packaging rather than the actual product. In Image A, the scanner is shown with its characteristic components like buttons and a paper feed tray, confirming that Image B has replaced it with packaging. Thus, a comparison shows that the scanner is replaced by a box-shaped design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the packaging feature visible metallic textures such as brushed metal, chrome, or reflective surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the left side of the box, visual elements suggest a metallic look, akin to brushed steel or aluminum finishes, which is commonly associated with such textures. These textures are recognizable by their distinctive patterns and reflective qualities, which are evident here. Image A lacks any metallic textures, focusing only on the scanner's standard matte finish, showing the addition of metallic textures in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the packaging exhibit an iridescent color effect with shifting hues across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a striking gradient effect with a range of colors transitioning smoothly across the packaging, suggesting an iridescent effect. This phenomenon is characterized by the movement and shifts in color perception based on angle or lighting. Image A shows no such effect, as it focuses on the standard color of the scanner body, confirming that Image B incorporates this visual effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a holographic display on the front of the packaging showing the scanner in operation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the packaging shows a graphical depiction of the scanner with a digital glow effect beneath it, simulating a holographic display often used to visually suggest high-tech or innovative features. The scanner is shown atop a blue-lit area, resembling a holographic projection setup. Image A lacks this feature, showcasing only the physical scanner with no holographic treatment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible grid lines or circuit-like patterns across the surface of the packaging that resemble data flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any designs indicative of grid lines or circuit-like patterns that suggest data flow, which are typically manifested in linear, geometric patterns or lines that resemble electronic circuits. The packaging primarily features branding, a graphic scanner depiction, and reflective textures, which does not contain these elements. Image A, being an image of the scanner, does not depict packaging elements, making no contribution to such patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there tech-themed icons (e.g., circuits, data streams, digital symbols) and modern branding elements visible on the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a range of graphical elements on the left side of the packaging that could be interpreted as modern tech-themed branding, such as icons or logos positioned against a metallic finish. These likely serve to communicate advanced technology or digital innovation. Image A, being a scanner, lacks these visual branding features, focusing solely on the functional aspects such as buttons and trays, confirming the presence of tech-themed branding in Image B.",
