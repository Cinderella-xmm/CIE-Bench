      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, there is a prominent text saying 'Catch the Wave' which is placed clearly above the horizon. The title is substantial in size, immediately capturing attention. By analyzing the placement of the text in relation to the photo's natural elements like the ocean and horizon, it is evident that the title is positioned well above the horizon line.",

      "question": "Is there a note in the bottom-left corner that reads “Summer Adventures – 2025”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no text or note present in the bottom-left corner. The 'Summer Adventures – 2025' is part of the same text as the title, positioned below 'Catch the Wave,' but not in the bottom-left corner. Hence, based on the visual cues from the image, the correct observation is that such a note does not exist in the specified location.",

      "question": "Is the title “Catch the Wave” visibly larger compared to other elements in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title 'Catch the Wave' in Image B is noticeably larger compared to other textual elements in the image. This styling choice is typical for titles, to make them stand out and be easily recognizable as the main theme or subject. The size comparison with 'Summer Adventures – 2025' further confirms this, as the latter is significantly smaller.",

      "question": "Is the title “Catch the Wave” positioned above the visible horizon line in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'Catch the Wave' is depicted above the visible horizon line. This placement is strategic, as the horizon naturally divides the image, allowing the text to stand out against the softer backdrop of the sky, enhancing its visibility and thematic impact.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Summer Adventures – 2025' does include the year '2025' as part of the text, however, it is not placed in the bottom-left corner but rather directly beneath the title ‘Catch the Wave’. Therefore, while the text contains the year “2025,” it does not appear in the specified corner location.",
