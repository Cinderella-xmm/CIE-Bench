      "question": "Is the ornate lantern now presented as a candle brand packaging rather than a hanging light fixture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornate lantern is positioned next to a box and two candles, suggesting an ambient setting for a candle brand rather than purely serving as a hanging light fixture. The lantern in this context might imply a thematic design for the brand. Therefore, the ornate lantern's context has shifted from just a decorative object to potentially being part of a candle brand presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the intricate patterns from the original lantern retained on the exterior of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based solely on Image B, there are intricate patterns visible on the lantern, but not explicitly on the external packaging (the box next to the candles). The packaging seems to have a more plain texture with a prominent logo, lacking the detailed patterns that the lantern shows.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a metallic embossed flame logo visible on the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a distinct metallic flame logo prominently featured on the box. This is evident by its three-dimensional appearance and shiny metallic finish, which suggest embossing, typical in premium product packaging designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the marketplace elements (e.g., spices, figures, stalls) adapted into decorative texture patterns on the sides of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box in Image B does not exhibit any identifiable marketplace elements such as spices, figures, or stalls adapted into patterns. Instead, it displays a more formal design with a metallic logo, with no indication of texture patterns reminiscent of the marketplace scene from Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the color scheme been updated to include deep golds and ambers throughout the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of deep gold and amber tones is evident on the packaging, particularly on the box's surface and the candlesâ€™ glow. These colors suggest the theme of warmth and luxury, common in product presentations aimed at a premium market.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a silhouette of a scented candle visible on the front of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B does not show a silhouette of a scented candle. Instead, it prominently features a metallic flame logo on the box. The silhouette idea might be inferred from the direct presence of lit candles beside the box, but not as a design element of the packaging itself.",
