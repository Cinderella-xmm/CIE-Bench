      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Have both individuals been transformed into a chibi-style 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, both figures appear rounded and have exaggerated features typical of chibi-style 3D models. The simplified rendering with distinct colors and shapes indicates this style. Applying world knowledge, chibi-style models often emphasize childlike proportions and cartoonish aesthetics.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the person in front still wearing a formal suit and holding a cup in the chibi-style 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person at the forefront is depicted in a formal suit, which is characterized by its tailored design, and is holding a cup, consistent with the business-like attire and activity from Image A. The stylized rendering in the chibi format still maintains these elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the person in the back positioned near a gently glowing lamp resting on a table in the chibi-style 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp is clearly visible next to the rear person, emitting a soft light, a hallmark of ambient illumination that exists in both the stylized and realistic contexts. The person's placement near the lamp also mimics their location in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the scene maintain a photorealistic vibe with warm lighting throughout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has transitioned to a chibi-style, which by definition, focuses on cartoon-like, exaggerated and oversimplified features. Therefore, the realistic details typically found in photorealism are absent. However, the lighting remains warm and inviting, akin to Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Is the entire composition enclosed within a photo frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi model is presented within a bordered structure which visually resembles a photo frame. This design suggests the image is framed, containing the scene and its elements within a defined area.",
