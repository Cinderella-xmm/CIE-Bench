      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are several kites, and two of them have unfinished outlines filled with white, suggesting they might be on paper. These shapes are reminiscent of paper craft models, considering their outlined look and simplicity. The visual cues indicate a design commonly associated with DIY paper models, thus suggesting they might be intended for a craft activity. The traditional shape of the kites aligns with common paper kite designs.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The primary kite in Image B is a bright yellow, which is a vibrant color that often captures attention and impart a sense of joy and playfulness.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kites are the central elements with a clear blue sky and some fluffy clouds as the background. While there are additional outlines suggesting possible kite designs, these elements do not dominate the image, leaving the primary colorful kite as a focal point. The background is minimal, which highlights the kites and keeps distractions to a minimum.",

      "question": "Are the structural details of the kite, such as its frame and tail, well-defined and clear enough to suggest it could be crafted from paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite in Image B displays clear outlines and structural details such as frame lines and a tail, typical of simplistic kite designs thought of in paper crafting. These details appear sharp and defined, indicative of typical paper folding and cutting techniques used in DIY crafts. The visual simplicity and structure allude to the fact that they can indeed be replicated as paper models.",
