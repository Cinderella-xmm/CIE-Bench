      "question": "Have the shoes been increased in size while keeping their original design intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoes appear larger relative to the legs, suggesting an increase in size. Maintaining the original design implies retaining key features like color patterns and shape. In Image B, the shoes indeed retain their design elements such as the color, style, and shape, similar to typical shoes, while appearing larger. Comparing to Image A, the shoes have kept their original design despite appearing increased in size.",

      "question": "Do the legs appear more cartoon-like compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs have a simplified and exaggerated appearance, often indicative of a cartoon style with less detail and smoother surface. This cartoonish style is achieved through smoother lines and a lack of intricate detail. Comparing with Image A, which features legs with more realistic shading and texture, Image B indeed presents legs in a more cartoon-like manner.",

      "question": "Are the feet placed on a shelf shaped like clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the feet resting on a structure that visually resembles clouds. World knowledge tells us clouds in stylized illustrations can often be depicted as bulbous and soft shapes. In Image B, these balloon-like formations are distinctly underfoot, suggesting a cloud-like platform. Comparing to Image A, where feet are directly interacting with smaller cloud formations, Image B directly places them on a shelf-like structure resembling a cloud.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall appearance of the legs and shoes reflect a bobblehead-style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A bobblehead-style transformation typically involves an exaggerated or disproportionate feature compared to the normal anatomy, such as a larger head or feet relative to the body. In Image B, the enlarged shoes combined with cartoon-like legs suggest a transition towards a bobblehead-style visual, as the size relationship between the feet and rest of the body diminishes realism. This transformation is apparent when comparing with the more proportionate depiction in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shoes still maintain their original design details after being resized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoes retain features like their color scheme, style, and details matching typical sneakers, despite appearing larger. This implies the original design details are intact. Comparing to Image A, which showcases these same features, the shoes in Image B indeed maintain their design attributes post-resize.",
