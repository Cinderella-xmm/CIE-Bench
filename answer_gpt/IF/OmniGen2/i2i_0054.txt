}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there any visible shadows in the image?",

}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the banana shape and metal stand curves highlighted effectively?",

    "Question": "Q4: Does the image maintain a minimalistic design without unnecessary elements?",
    "explanation": "A minimalistic design often involves simplicity and the absence of superfluous features. Image B is entirely gray, lacking any visible elements, which aligns with the concept of minimalism. By having an entirely blank canvas, it inherently avoids unnecessary elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the edited image meet the standard of a minimalistic design asset?",
