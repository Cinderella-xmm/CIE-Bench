      "question": "Is the cityscape rendered in a watercolor style with visible brushstrokes and soft blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the cityscape background looks more graphic and digital than a traditional watercolor painting. The lines and colors are bold and clear, which is typically indicative of a digital illustration rather than the soft blending and visible brushstrokes characteristic of watercolor. Thus, the style in Image B appears to lack the organic texture and subtle variations seen with watercolor paints.",
