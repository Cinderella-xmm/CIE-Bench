      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pie depicted with human-like features such as a face and limbs, resembling a fussy old librarian?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie does not have human-like features such as a face and limbs. Instead, the pie is personified through dialogue bubbles, suggesting speech but not via physical anthropomorphization. This personification suggests traits akin to being fussy. However, without limbs or face, it cannot resemble a librarian visually.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the knife been visually altered to resemble a feather pen, and is it being held by the pie character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife maintains its original form and does not resemble a feather pen. It is placed on the pie but not held by it, as the pie does not have the physically depicted capability to hold objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lattice crust pattern visible on the pie character as a patterned apron, draped over its lower half?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lattice crust pattern in Image B appears on the upper surface of the pie. It does not resemble an apron draped over the pie's lower half because the pie does not have human-like features to suggest parts such as a lower half where an apron might be draped.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Does Scene 1 display the text “Hush! Respect the quiet crust.” and feature other pastry characters appearing to chatter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Scene 1 of Image B, the text bubble with “Hush! Respect the quiet crust.” is indeed present, but there are no other pastry characters seen that suggest chatter or noise. The pie is depicted in isolation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does Scene 2 contain the text “You’ll get a slice of silence!” and show the feather pen positioned above the pie in a stern, hovering manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Scene 2 of Image B, the text bubble with “You’ll get a slice of silence!” is present, but the knife is not altered to look like a feather pen, and it is laid across the pie rather than positioned above it in a hovering manner.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the image composed as a two-panel comic strip with distinct scene divisions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clearly two scenes, each represented as a separate segment of the panel, typical of a comic strip format. The separation and division of scenes suggest distinct panels.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the artwork rendered in a cartoonish, illustrative style rather than photorealistic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is characterized by a cartoonish, illustrative style, evident from the simplified and stylized depiction of objects and the presence of dialogue bubbles, contrasting with the photorealistic style seen in Image A.",
