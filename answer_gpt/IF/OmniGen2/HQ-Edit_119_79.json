      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface texture of the cat is smooth and shiny, resembling crystal rather than fur.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's body is smooth and has a shiny appearance, resembling quartz crystals. The translucent sections and the reflection suggest the use of materials similar to clear and smoky quartz, which typically have transparent or partly opaque qualities.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows color variations on the cat's body, specifically brown and black areas.
