    "Question": "Q1: Has the food been rearranged into a Michelin-style plating?",
    "explanation": "The image shows a dish of sliced steak, carrots, and garnishes presented neatly and elegantly on a plate, resembling the aesthetic often associated with Michelin guide restaurants. Michelin-style plating typically involves artistic presentation with attention to detail, colors, and texture contrast. The use of sauce dots and a green garnish, as well as the organized arrangement of the food items, contribute to this style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the steak spiral-rolled?",
    "explanation": "The steak in Image B is sliced into several uniform pieces, not spiral-rolled. A spiral-rolled steak would appear as a single piece of meat rolled into a spiral shape, but here it consists of neatly aligned, distinct slices.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the carrots cut into a fan-shape?",
    "explanation": "The image shows whole, peeled carrots arranged in a straightforward manner. A fan shape would imply that the carrots are cut into thin, angled slices and spread out in a fan-like arrangement. Instead, the carrots are kept intact in their natural cylindrical form.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Have sauce dots been added to each vegetable?",
    "explanation": "The image displays sauce dots artfully placed on the plate, predominantly around the steak. The visual balance enhances the gourmet style, but these dots are not on each vegetable. The carrots, for example, don't have sauce dots directly on them.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the food served on a large white ceramic plate?",
    "explanation": "The image clearly shows the food arranged on a large, round, white plate, which appears to be ceramic based on its characteristic texture and shine. This type of plate is commonly used in high-end dining settings, consistent with the aesthetic presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
