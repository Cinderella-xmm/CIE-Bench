    "Question": "Q1: Is the orange depicted as a rubber keychain rather than a natural fruit?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembles an orange but features an unnatural-looking attachment point, which suggests it is not a real fruit. The surface is too smooth and shiny, lacking the detail of a natural fruit skin, making it likely that the item is a representation rather than an actual orange, possibly a keychain or decorative object.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the keychain still retain the original stem of the orange?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object still possesses a top stem-like structure, though it appears to be a stylized representation. It closely mimics the position and form of the stem on a natural orange, suggesting that while it is part of a keychain, the feature is retained for authenticity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the keychain maintain the glossy texture seen in the original orange?",

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the keychain visually recognizable as a citrus fruit?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite being a keychain, the object clearly resembles an orange. It has the distinctive round shape and orange color commonly associated with citrus fruits, making it immediately recognizable as a representation of an orange.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the keychain include a visible attachment point like a ring or clip for keys?",
