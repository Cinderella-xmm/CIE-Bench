    "Question": "Q2: Is the layout of the edited image strongly asymmetrical?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the composition of the elements, particularly the position of the child and the adult on skateboards, shows an asymmetrical balance, where the subjects are offset rather than being centered or symmetrically positioned. This layout helps create a dynamic visual tension, which is often used in various design approaches to add interest.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Have the human figures and the background tent been simplified into flat graphic shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the human figures and the background elements, including what represents the tent, are reduced to flat graphic shapes. The figures lack detailed features and instead consist of bold outlines and solid colors. This approach is consistent with graphic simplification for a cleaner, more stylized appearance like that in vector art or graphic design posters.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the colors in the edited image restricted to blues, whites, and the man's green shirt as an accent?",
