    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the statue and its base fully enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue and its base are visually contained within a glass dome, which is a clear indication that they are fully enclosed. The dome appears to be a standard glass covering, transparent and covering the entirety of the miniature scene contained within.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the statue been transformed into a sleek, metallic 3D figure with a reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue retains its original stone-like appearance rather than a sleek metallic finish. The textures and coloring suggest a material similar to stone, rather than a reflective metal surface, indicating that the statue hasnâ€™t been transformed into a metallic figure.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small-scale trees with translucent or semi-transparent leaves surrounding the metallic figure inside the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows small-scale trees inside the dome around the statue. These trees are part of the miniature scene, but their leaves do not appear translucent or semi-transparent, so they appear true to life, likely depicting a normal scale model rather than one with translucent features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there additional small engraved plaques with historical text visible on the base of the miniature scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the miniature scene clearly shows additional plaques that are engraved, likely with historical text. These engravings are visually evident and add detail that was not part of the simple base in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the stand beneath the glass dome feature a polished stone surface with delicate vine patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stand beneath the glass dome has a polished appearance consistent with high-quality material, possibly stone or porcelain. There are visible delicate vine patterns along its surface, suggesting an ornate design choice consistent with fine craftsmanship.",
