    "Question": "Q1: Are the mountains rendered as geometric shapes with sharp angles and flat surfaces instead of realistic contours?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are stylized with sharp angles and geometric shapes, presenting flat surfaces. This rendering aligns with a more abstract or stylized illustration, possibly influenced by geometric design principles, rather than realistic contours seen in natural landscapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the trees depicted as geometric forms, such as triangular or stepped shapes, with no realistic leaf details?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are represented as simplistic geometric forms without detailed depiction of leaves, using triangular shapes that suggest an abstract or stylized representation rather than aiming for realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the river composed of a series of radiating parallel lines rather than a continuous, reflective body of water?",
    "explanation": "The river in Image B appears as a series of stylized, radiating lines rather than a continuous reflective surface typical of natural water bodies, indicating a more abstract representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are all elements in the image outlined with bold, clear lines and filled with solid, unshaded colors?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses bold, clear lines to define all elements, and they are filled with solid colors without gradients or shading. This approach is often seen in graphic styles that focus on flat designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the reflection in the water a perfectly symmetrical and geometrically aligned mirror image of the foreground elements?",
    "explanation": "The reflection in the water of Image B is geometrically precise and symmetrical, mirroring the foreground elements in a way that is aligned and tidy, emphasizing symmetry over realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there any visible gradients or soft shading in the sky, mountains, or water, or are all areas filled with flat, solid colors?",
    "explanation": "Image B is entirely composed of flat, solid colors in the sky, mountains, and water, with no visible gradients or shading, which aligns with a stylized, graphic aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the image use a vibrant, high-contrast color palette typical of Art Deco design, including bold hues like red, gold, blue, and black?",
    "explanation": "Image B incorporates a vibrant and high-contrast color palette with bold hues such as red, gold, and blue. This choice of colors is reminiscent of the Art Deco style, known for its use of striking and vivid color combinations.",
