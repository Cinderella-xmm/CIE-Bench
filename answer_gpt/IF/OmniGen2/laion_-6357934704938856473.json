      "question": "Does the robot exhibit a brushed metal and matte finish across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the robot inside the box shows a surface that resembles the texture often found in manufactured robots and high-tech models. The typical characteristics of a brushed metal and matte finish would include a non-glossy appearance and faint lines or textures that give a sophisticated, sleek look. Based on the visual cues, the robot appears to have such a finish, contributing to a high-quality aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the robot displayed inside a hexagonal box labeled \"MECHA VANGUARD\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box containing the robot is visible in the image, and it has a shape that is more rectangular than hexagonal, forming a typical box. The front of the box clearly shows a label that reads 'MECRA VANGUARD,' which suggests this might be a brand name or model name for the robot. While the box shape itself appears standard, the label indicates otherwise. The interpretation of 'hexagonal box' could refer to the partial cut-out design but is not predominantly hexagonal.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are multiple weapons visible, indicating they are replaceable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the image, the robot is seen holding a gun in one hand and a sword in the other hand, which suggests that it is equipped with different types of weapons. However, there is no visible indication that these weapons are replaceable, such as additional weapons stored in the packaging or an instruction for replacement. The presence of different weapons alone does not confirm their interchangeability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible detailed engravings on the robot's armor plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting the robot in the image, the armor plates appear smooth without any visible detailed engravings. Engravings would typically be visible as intricate lines, patterns, or designs etched into the surface, which are not discernible from the visual information provided. Thus, there are no detailed engravings apparent on the armor.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are visible joint articulations present at key limb connections (e.g., shoulders, elbows, hips)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot displayed in the packaging shows clear segmentations at key limb connections such as the shoulders, elbows, and hips. These segmentations suggest articulations for movement, which are common in models designed to offer posability. The visual evidence of these joints, typical in high-quality robot figures, confirms their presence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a dramatic splash screen behind the robot depicting a futuristic cityscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the packaging inside the box where the robot is placed features a large vibrant image that illustrates a cityscape with tall structures and bright lights. This setting aligns with common depictions of futuristic environments, utilized often in product displays to enhance thematic appeal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the background cityscape include high-tech elements such as neon lights, flying vehicles, or digital interfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cityscape in the background of the box exhibits features typical of advanced or futuristic cities: tall skyscrapers with lights that could plausibly be considered neon. However, the image does not explicitly show flying vehicles or digital interfaces, which are distinctive markers of a high-tech atmosphere. The emphasis leans more towards an illuminated skyline rather than fully integrating high-tech elements.",
