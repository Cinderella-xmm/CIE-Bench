    "Question": "Q1: Does the dog and banana appear as a single unified form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and banana appear as two separate objects that are positioned close to each other but remain visually distinct. The banana is alongside the dog, and there are no physical alterations or blending to suggest that they form a single entity. Therefore, based on the visual information and common understanding of distinct objects, they do not constitute a single unified form.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the blended form retain a realistic appearance without obvious signs of manipulation?",
    "explanation": "For Image B, observing the dog and the banana, both look realistic as separate objects without any visible manipulation to blend them into a single form. Each retains its natural appearance and detailing (e.g., texture, color), consistent with realistic representations and expectations of such objects in an image. Therefore, the realistic appearance is retained without obvious signs of blending manipulation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the transition between the dog and banana smooth and seamless?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, there isn't any blending transition between the dog and the banana; they are positioned closely but remain distinct with clear edges around each. The lack of visible blending or unifying transition ensures they remain as separately identifiable entities, suggesting no smooth or seamless transition attempt.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the proportions and scale of the blended form consistent and realistic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the size proportion between the dog and banana seems exaggerated, as the banana appears unusually large in comparison to the dog, which is not consistent with typical sizes found in nature. This size disparity indicates a non-realistic scale concerning proportion, likely intentional for visual effect.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the lighting and shadows on the blended form match the original lighting conditions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on both the dog and banana appears consistent, with similar lighting conditions affecting both objects uniformly. There are no mismatches in terms of brightness or shadow that would indicate separate lighting treatment, which means the lighting and shadows match and reflect the overall natural lighting condition of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
