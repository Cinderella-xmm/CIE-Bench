      "question": "Is the original fruit platter photo used as the centerpiece without significant alterations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fruit platter is prominently featured at the center of what appears to be product packaging. The visual composition suggests that the platter from Image A is directly used in Image B, as the arrangement and type of fruits (pineapple, kiwi, pear, watermelon, banana, orange, and blueberries) look identical. No significant alterations like color changes, rearrangement, or distortion of proportions are evident. Therefore, the same photo appears to be used without significant changes.",

      "question": "Have decorative green leaf graphics been added around the fruit platter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I observe decorative elements resembling green leaves on the packaging design around the fruit platter. These do not appear in Image A, indicating that they were specifically added to enhance the packaging's visual appeal and align with the 'natural' or 'fresh' theme often used in product marketing. These green leaves are likely graphic additions to the image in the editing process.",

      "question": "Does the image reflect a ready-to-eat supermarket packaging style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design resembles typical product packaging found in supermarkets. The fruit platter is placed on what looks like a bag or packet, complete with branding information like 'DAILY VITAMIN C SUPPLY.' This presentation, along with the use of appealing graphics and typography, is consistent with consumer product packaging styles meant to attract buyers, suggesting the image embodies a supermarket packaging style.",

      "question": "Is the background styled with a light green gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background that transitions smoothly from a lighter to darker green, creating a gradient effect. This kind of gradient is often used in design to highlight the central object—in this case, the fruit platter—by providing an aesthetically pleasing backdrop. As this gradient background is distinct from the plain background observed in Image A, it confirms a design choice in the packaging style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fruit platter appears to retain its original layout, colors, and details from Image A, such as the rich vibrant hues of the fruit slices and their arrangement. There are no noticeable alterations to the color tones or the position of the fruit, suggesting faithful preservation of these visual elements from the original image.",
