      "question": "Is the eagle enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual cues indicate the eagle is enclosed within a transparent glass dome. The eagle is visibly inside a glass container with reflections and curves that characterize typical glass surfaces, helping to infer enclosure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the eagle appear as a 3D stylized sculpture with sculptural features (e.g., defined form, modeling lines, or material texture)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eagle inside the glass dome displays characteristics typical of a 3D stylized sculpture, such as clearly defined modeling lines, precise form, and its material indicating it is not a real eagle, but rather a crafted object.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows swirling cloud structures directly underneath the eagle's wings within the dome. These clouds are miniaturized and artistically styled which signify them being placed intentionally beneath the wings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the base of the glass dome, which appears to be made of polished dark wood. The texture and color of the base indicate common traits of dark wooden materials, suggesting it is indeed a wooden base.",

      ],

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
