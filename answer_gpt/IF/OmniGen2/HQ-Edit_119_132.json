      "question": "Is the husky depicted as a plush toy rather than a live animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the husky has a smooth, uniform texture that lacks the irregularities and natural movement associated with a live animal's fur. The lines and curves of the body are very precise and symmetrical, giving it a manufactured appearance. The overall aesthetic suggests an artificial rendering, commonly associated with plush toys. These visual cues align with the appearance of plush toys rather than live animals.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the husky's paws appear significantly larger and more exaggerated than those of a real husky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the husky's paws are rounded, large, and prominently proportioned relative to the rest of its body. This exaggeration in size and the soft, rounded shape are typical characteristics of plush toys, where features are often accentuated for visual appeal and huggability, differing from the more realistic and proportional anatomy of a live husky.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the fur texture been replaced with a soft, velvety fabric appearance throughout the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur appears to have a sleek and glossy surface with a uniform, smooth texture that mimics fabric rather than the varied and fluffy texture of real animal fur. This sleekness and uniformity suggest a velvety or soft fabric commonly used in plush toys, indicating a deliberate choice to portray the husky as a toy rather than a living creature.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial features, particularly the eyes, rendered as embroidered details rather than realistic ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the husky's eyes are designed with a flat, uniform blue hue and outlined in a way that mirrors embroidery or stitching, typical of plush toys. The lack of depth and dimensionality suggests an embroidered look, which is common in plush toy designs to simulate expression without using real glassy or moist-looking realistic eyes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the plush toy placed on a clean wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the husky is positioned on a surface that appears to be a light wooden texture, smooth and flat, which is typical for a shelf or tabletop. The simplicity and uniformity of the surface suggest it is a clean wooden shelf, suitable for displaying objects like toys.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background minimalist, without any natural elements like snow, trees, or sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a plain, unobtrusive light color without any vertical elements, designs, or color gradients that suggest the presence of natural features. This minimalist design helps focus attention on the subject (plush toy), differing from open natural environments filled with elements like snow or trees.",
