        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted wearing a black tailored suit, which typically consists of matching trousers and a jacket, often associated with formal or stylish events. The high collar and cravat are visible details often found in 19th-century fashion, indicating sophistication and formality. The visual cues such as the suit's structure, the white high collar with a cravat, support the identification. Hence, the figure is indeed wearing a tailored suit with a high collar and cravat.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headwear of the figure is a top hat which is a cylindrical hat commonly worn in the 19th century and usually signifies high social status or fashion consciousness.

Comparing this with common knowledge about turbans, which are typically wrapped cloth garments, the visual cues confirm the replacement with a top hat including the feather.",
