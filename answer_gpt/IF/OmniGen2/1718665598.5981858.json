    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the elements of the scene (road, sky, trees, poles) fragmented into geometric shapes such as polygons, rectangles, and triangles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each element is systematically represented through geometric shapes. The sky is composed of large polygonal segments, seamlessly connecting to form an abstract pattern. The road is depicted with angular polygons taking the place of smooth asphalt, clearly breaking down the natural scene into geometric sections. Compared to Image A, where elements like clouds and road show fluidity and realism, Image B deliberately contrasts this with deliberate geometric fragmentation, aligning with artistic abstraction.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the road composed of angular, non-smooth sections instead of a smooth, curving surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the road through sharp edges and linear segments, diverging from reality, characterized by the presence of various polygons along its surface. This geometric representation highlights the angular transformation that departs from the smooth, realistic curving road observed in Image A, where the road curves smoothly without angular segmentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the clouds represented as overlapping quadrilateral or polygonal shapes rather than soft, natural cloud formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are depicted as overlapping geometric shapes, such as quadrilaterals and other polygons, breaking away from the soft and natural depiction typically expected in sky scenes. This stylized approach contrasts with Image A, where clouds are portrayed with natural softness and seamless transitions, consistent with observational reality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the telegraph poles rendered in a stylized, geometric form using angular lines and shapes rather than realistic proportions and textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the telegraph poles using simplified, angular lines without the usual detail and texture seen in realistic depictions. This aligns with the overall geometric theme of the scene, in stark contrast to Image A where the poles maintain realistic proportions and some natural variation in texture, reflecting a more lifelike scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the trees depicted as abstract triangular shapes rather than natural, rounded tree canopies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are illustrated with sharp, triangular forms, which abstract away from the rounded canopies usually seen in natural tree shapes. This geometric abstraction provides a stylized perspective that differs from Image A, where the trees have naturally rounded canopies, representative of realism in tree depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image use only muted greens, grays, and deep yellows, avoiding bright or saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly features a palette comprised of muted greens, grays, and deep yellows, fostering a consistent, subdued aesthetic typical of designs favoring geometric abstraction. These colors create a harmonious yet non-vibrant look compared to Image A, which uses a wider range of natural colors like vibrant greens and blues under normal lighting conditions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a clear sense of depth and perspective in the scene, with the road leading toward a distant horizon despite the geometric abstraction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B ensures depth and perspective by showing the road narrowing and receding into the horizon, aided by the alignment of geometric elements. This depiction is consistent with the portrayal in Image A as well, where the road curves naturally toward a distant point, enhancing depth perception despite the stylized format of Image B.",
