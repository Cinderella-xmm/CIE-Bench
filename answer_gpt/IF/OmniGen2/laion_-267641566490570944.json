      "question": "Are the jagged mountain peaks transformed into ancient dragon spirits with distinct dragon-like features such as heads, limbs, and tails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains feature a striking dragon reclining among them. This dragon has a clear head, limbs, and tail, all characterized by distinct dragon-like features. The visual cues of scales, a serpentine shape, and turquoise coloration closely resemble imaginative dragon representations. Hence, the mountain has been transformed into an ancient dragon spirit with recognizable features.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the mountain surfaces feature visible rocky scales that mimic dragon skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dragon embedded within the landscape, whose body appears to have scales typically observed on a dragon's skin. However, besides the dragon, we don't observe a texture transformation that suggests the mountain itself has taken on a scaly dragon skin appearance. The rocky mountains retain a natural rock surface instead.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the spines of the dragon-shaped mountains covered in moss-like vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a dragon whose body integrates with the mountain backdrop. The dragon itself has some vegetation on its body, giving a moss-like appearance in regions aligning with its spine. This closely mimics the natural vegetation found on mountains.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tallest mountain peak reshaped into a dragonâ€™s head with clearly visible crystal horns and serpentine eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon has a distinct head with horns and serpentine eyes. However, the tallest mountain peak itself has not been reshaped to resemble another dragon head. The dragon exists separately within the landscape, thus the mountain peaks remain unchanged in this context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the mountain ridges extend into sinuous, snake-like bodies that fade into the mist, with sections resembling coiled limbs or tails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon seamlessly integrates into the landscape in Image B with a sinuous, snake-like body that fades into the mist. Its form includes visible sections resembling limbs or tail, characteristic of a serpentine form. The ridges themselves do not transform in this manner.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the dragon-shaped mountains blend seamlessly into the surrounding misty, atmospheric environment without abrupt visual breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a dragon figure smoothly integrated within the misty landscape. The dragon, along with the mountains, blends well into the atmospheric background, without any abrupt visual interruptions. The mist aids in this blending, enhancing the continuity of the image between character and landscape.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the overall lighting and atmospheric quality (such as warm glow, mist, and layered depth) preserved from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, both maintain a warm atmospheric glow with mist and layered depth. Despite the introduction of the dragon in Image B, the lighting and misty environment closely follow the essence of the original image, reflecting a similar mood and illumination across the landscape.",
