    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall shape of the object now clearly that of an owl rather than a teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object visually resembles an owl, with features such as large, round eyes, a beak-like structure, and claw-like feet. These elements collectively denote the image of an owl, suggesting that the overall shape has been altered to represent an owl instead of a traditional teapot, which usually has a rounded body, spout, and handle without such distinctive animal features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lid of the original teapot form the crown-like head of the owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crown-like head of the owl features intricate designs and patterns similar to the original teapot lid. The top of the object has been creatively repurposed to portray the owl's head, with the ornate patterns contributing to the crown-like appearance characteristic of an owl's head.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original engravings now transformed into metallic feather-like patterns covering the owl's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic engravings visible in Image B have been deliberately styled to resemble feathers on the owl's body. Combined world knowledge of metallurgy and ornamental design indicate these intricate patterns emulate the appearance and texture of feathers, emphasizing the transformation from simple engravings to feather-like aesthetics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the spout been reshaped into a sharp, mechanical beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a transition where the teapot spout is aligned vertically and resembles an owl's beak. This reshaped structure mimics the sharp and distinct form of a mechanical beak, as opposed to the traditionally curved teapot spout seen in Image A, underpinning the transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the handle been transformed into a gracefully curved tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the handle retains its ornate design but functions as one of the owl's wings, rather than a tail. The handle is positioned in a manner that complements the owl body structure, suggesting the transformation does not render the handle as a tail but as part of the bird's features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two glowing eyes made of cogs visible on the owl's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the owl with large, glowing eyes, characteristic of an owl's appearance. However, while the design is complex and visually mechanical, the eyes do not present an explicit cog structure but rather appear rounded and more typical of organic or stylized depictions of eyes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the owl positioned on a richly carved wooden branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl appears to be seated on a wooden surface, stylized to resemble a branch. The careful carving and appearance of wood grain provide a clear representation of an owl perched on such a natural element, aligning with the thematic image transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
