    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the robot now a miniature 3D articulated model instead of a full-sized giant robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is under a transparent dome, and its size relative to the dome indicates it is a miniature model. The presence of a display case suggests it is a collectible or display item, which is typical for scale models and not for full-sized objects. This is a strong indication that what is depicted is indeed a miniature model rather than a life-sized robot.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the robot enclosed within a circular display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is placed under a dome which is perfectly round in appearance, typical of circular display cases designed to protect and showcase models or collectibles. The contour of the dome follows a smooth circular shape, confirming its circular nature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible tiny gears under transparent panels on the robot’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon detailed examination of Image B, there are no obvious transparent panels or visible gears on the surface of the robot. The robot appears to have a solid surface without transparent sections revealing internal mechanisms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the display positioned on a hexagonal black base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the display is clearly shaped with multiple angled edges, forming a hexagon as opposed to any other polygon shape. The base's color is distinctly black, confirming the description given in the question.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the robot’s model number etched in a luminous silver font on the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are inscriptions visible on the base, but they are in a luminous blue color rather than silver. The choice of color is distinctly different from silver and adds a futuristic design element, often used for emphasis in displays.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a miniaturized landscape around the display that reflects the original scene’s elements (e.g., trees, terrain, distant city)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature landscape within the display case that includes greenery and undulating terrain, resembling the natural features in Image A. However, there is no visible representation of a distant city as was seen in Image A, which is a significant scene element left out in the miniaturized version.",
