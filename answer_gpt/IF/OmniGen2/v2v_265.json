        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train does not have large eyes or a cheerful smile. Instead, it features a simple design with a front headlamp and windows but displays no anthropomorphic features like eyes or a smile. The cartoon style gives it a playful look, but it does not include these specific features associated with anthropomorphized cartoon characters.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly showcases a countryside scene with rolling green hills and a bright blue sky, which is a common portrayal of idyllic rural landscapes.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, colorful flowers are visibly present, lining the tracks. Their presence adds to the cartoonish and idyllic nature of the scene, enhancing the countryside aesthetic. These flowers, represented in bright colors, are not found in Image A's industrial setting.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B uses bright and vibrant colors rather than soft pastel shades. The colors are saturated and bold, which is typical for cartoon styles aimed at being visually engaging, rather than the soft, muted tones of pastel colors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D chibi-style cartoon locomotive in Image B, characterized by a simplified and exaggerated design, is well-suited to the stylized countryside environment. This environment, with its vibrant green hills and blue sky, compliments the playful aesthetic and blends well with the cartoon style, even though the countryside setting maintains a level of semi-realism.",
