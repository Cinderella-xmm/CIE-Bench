      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Xu's Fresh Zone' appears both on the refrigerator's brand logo area and the top shelf. This indicates the label is not placed exclusively on the top shelf, as it also features prominently on the door where brand logos are usually located.",
