      "question": "Does the image have a white border frame surrounding it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible white border surrounding the central image of the dessert, which is a characteristic feature of Polaroid-style photographs. This white border is not present in Image A, and can be clearly seen in Image B, indicating it is a new addition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a handwritten caption at the bottom of the image that reads “Banana Cream Dream 2024”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a caption at the bottom within the white border, which reads 'Banana Cream 2024'. The handwritten style is mimicked through the font used for the caption. In Image A, this caption does not exist, showing that it was added when editing the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit a light brown vintage filter that gives the appearance of a film-style photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display signs of any visual change associated with a vintage filter application, such as altered coloring toward sepia tones or grainy textures. The appearance closely matches Image A, except for the added border and text. This suggests that no vintage filter has been applied.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the image presented in a Polaroid style with the combination of the white border frame and vintage filter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image in Image B has a white border frame, which is consistent with Polaroid style, however, it lacks any vintage filter effects, such as color or texture changes. Therefore, it does not fulfill all characteristics typically required to be considered a Polaroid style image.",

      "question": "Has the original dessert appearance been preserved without any changes apart from the added frame, caption, and filter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dessert depicted in Image B retains its appearance from Image A, as there are no alterations to the dessert itself such as its configuration or coloring. The only changes noted include the addition of a border and a text caption at the bottom, with no filter evident.",
