      "question": "Is there a cartoon-style anthropomorphic shrimp character holding a chef’s hat in a heroic pose in the first panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1, a cartoon-style anthropomorphic shrimp character is depicted, and it is wearing a chef’s hat. The character appears to pose in a way that suggests confidence or heroism by standing with a raised arm, but not necessarily in a classic heroic pose. Heroic poses often involve dynamic stances like arms raised in triumph or power stances, which is somewhat similar but not completely the same here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 1 contains text in a speech bubble, but the exact phrase analyzed from the image is “A DAISH. THE SNESTE BEGINS!” instead of the provided phrase. This indicates a difference in wording.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background of Panel 1 a kitchen scene with scattered spices and utensils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Panel 1 is minimalistic, featuring a plain setting with a few elements suggestive of cooking, such as a lemon and some spices on the ground. It does not depict a full kitchen scene with utensils; rather, it's more of a generic background that highlights the character and its immediate surroundings.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2, the shrimp character is not depicted. Instead, the focus is on a pan with cooked shrimp and lemon slices, without any shrimp character action shown, such as squeezing a lemon.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 does not contain any speech bubble. Instead, it focuses on showing a realistic image of shrimp in a pan with lemon slices and does not include text with this specific phrase.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 3, there is an apparent attempt to show herbs flying, indicated by lines, around a central element which seems to be a mound of shrimp. However, the shrimp character itself is not depicted dodging the sprinkles with motion lines to indicate active movement.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 3 contains a text bubble that reads “Herby, don’t fail faI't fail me now!” which is slightly different from the phrase provided. This indicates a similarity but not an exact match.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 4, the shrimp character is indeed standing on what appears to be a mound that resembles seasoned shrimp tails, giving an impression of triumph or success as it raises its arms upward in a victorious stance.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 4 features a speech bubble with text that reads “Fiery success with hint a hint of zing!” which is almost identical to the provided text, but has an extra 'hint' placed awkwardly. Despite this, the intent is close to the requested phrase.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Throughout the panels, reds are heavily featured in the depiction of the shrimp character and the cartoonish shrimp mounds, while greens appear less prominently. In the context of the comic, the reds and greens do suggest spices and herbs but are not displayed in a way mirroring the original pan image exactly.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The progression from Panel 1 introducing the character and the beginning of a 'flavor' adventure, through cooking in Panel 2, facing a challenge in Panel 3, and a victorious outcome in Panel 4, suggests a sequential story. Although the textual elements have minor inconsistencies, the narrative intent flows in a coherent manner throughout the panels.",
