    "Question": "Q1: Are the bookshelves now shaped like wooden wings adorned with leaves and positioned as if in flight?",

    "Question": "Q2: Have the hanging lamps been replaced with glowing, mushroom-shaped fungi?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lamps have a more organic, natural appearance with what seems to be layered, leaf-like patterns, but they do not resemble glowing mushrooms. From their design and hanging nature, they are more akin to stylized basket lamps found in rustic or nature-themed decor. Thus, they are not actual fungi but artistically-designed lamps.",
