      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara is sitting in a chair, holding a teacup which suggests a human-like posture, but it is not standing upright. A posture comparison with Image A confirms that the position is different, as Image A shows the capybara standing and holding a cocktail glass. Therefore, the edited image does not show the capybara in a standing upright position.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the capybara wearing a full suit with visible lapels, buttons, and a bow tie, consistent with Victorian fashion. The attire is much more formal than in Image A, where the capybara is wearing a knitted hat and a colorful sweater. The analysis indicates the presence of Victorian fashion characteristics in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The capybara in Image B is shown wearing a tall, black top hat, which is a classic representation of Victorian-era style. In contrast, Image A shows the capybara with a knitted blue hat, indicating a notable change. The evidence supports the presence of a Victorian-era top hat in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara is wearing glasses that cover both eyes rather than a monocle, which is typically a single lens worn over one eye. There is no monocle visible, as confirmed by a comparison with Image A where the capybara is wearing sunglasses. Therefore, the evidence indicates the absence of a monocle in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the capybara holding an ornate teacup and saucer, consistent with a high tea setting, instead of the cocktail glass seen in Image A. The presence of the teacup in Image B supports the replacement and aligns with commonly known Victorian themes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a backdrop that includes the iconic architecture of the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben, which are located along the River Thames in London.
