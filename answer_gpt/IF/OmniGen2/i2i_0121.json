      "question": "Does the character display exaggerated chibi proportions with a larger head and smaller body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character definitely shows exaggerated chibi proportions. This is recognizable from the disproportionately larger head compared to the body, alongside stubby limbs and a compact torso, which are distinctive features of chibi design. As a common stylized artistic representation, chibi characters generally have these exaggerated proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the character standing on a shell-shaped base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character positioned on a base that has a clear shell shape. This can be identified by its fan-like, curved appearance, complete with grooves that mimic those found on a seashell. The shell's design is rounded and detailed, making it evidently a base shaped like a shell.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi version retain the character's straw hat, red jacket, and cheerful expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the character wearing a straw hat and red jacket, which are characteristic to the original design. Although the character's facial details such as a cheerful expression are blurred, the other elements are distinct and consistent with the original attire. Thus, it can be inferred that the character retains the essential features.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the characterâ€™s features (like buttons on the jacket and belt) simplified but still recognizable in the chibi design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's red jacket exhibits simplified features like visible buttons, and a discernible belt on the shorts, maintaining clarity even in the chibi rendition. These elements retain a recognizable form, despite being simplified to fit the chibi style's exaggerated proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shell-shaped base in Image B is prominently visible beneath the character's feet. Its distinct fan-like form with curves and grooves is clearly depicted and sits under the character, unmistakably indicating it is a base.",
