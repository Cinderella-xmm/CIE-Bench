      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bed fully constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, including the frame, mattress, and base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a blue LEGO sheet or cover on the bed, clearly distinguished by visible studs and modular design, indicating partial construction from LEGO bricks. However, the frame and base appear identical to a traditional bed with a white finish similar to the original image's frame, indicating that they are likely not constructed from LEGO bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are white and light blue LEGO bricks used to recreate the botanical pattern visible on the original bedding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a blue LEGO surface without any patterns, as LEGO bricks distinctly show standard stud formations without variations forming botanical patterns. Therefore, the visual cues do not support the presence of recreated patterns using LEGO bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the headboard been replaced with smooth, curved LEGO pieces to create a rounded shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the headboard maintains the same straight, square-edged structure as the original image with no visible LEGO brick component in its design. This indicates there has been no replacement with curved LEGO pieces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pillows made from stacked smaller LEGO bricks, giving them a distinct three-dimensional structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pillows in the edited image lack any visible LEGO brick characteristics like studs or modular blocking. They retain a smooth surface identical to typical fabric pillows as seen in the original image. This implies they are not composed of stacked LEGO bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the edited and original images feature a grayscale backdrop, providing consistency in the lighting and color tone, ensuring the setting remains unchanged except for the bed itself.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the LEGO bed appear playful due to visible brick construction and structured due to orderly arrangement and clear modular design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image exhibits a blue LEGO sheet on the bed with prominent brick studs and modular alignment, portraying the classic playful, structured aesthetic often associated with LEGO designs. This arrangement clearly signifies the playful yet structured appearance of the LEGO element.",
