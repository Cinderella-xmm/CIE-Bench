      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the pages and their visual texture are observed.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit jacket is observed. The suit shows a blend of blue-black hues, with edges that appear soft and non-uniform, indicating a painterly style akin to watercolor effects. This suggests an artistic rendition rather than a real fabric.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
