      "question": "Have the zebra’s characteristic black-and-white stripes been retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's body is covered with black and white stripes, which are clear and distinct. These stripes are a primary characteristic of zebras and serve as their natural pattern in the wild. The design of these stripes in Image B reflects the natural zebra pattern, albeit in a more stylized and cartoonish way, which is commonly seen in designed products or illustrations. Given the clear presence of these black-and-white stripes, it is evident that this characteristic has been retained.",

      "question": "Are the ears of the zebra in an upright position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's ears are visibly oriented upwards, a position that typically indicates attentiveness or alertness in animals. This upright positioning is consistent with their natural state when the animal is alert or curious about its surroundings. The artistic simplification in this image retains this aspect of the zebra's anatomy, which is common in both realistic and stylized animal representations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is depicted with smooth lines and a simplified form, where the body's contours and the facial features are crafted to be clean and streamlined. This simplified approach enhances the versatility of the design, allowing it to be easily adapted for various cultural derivative products such as clothing, toys, or home decor. The use of strong, contrasting colors also enhances its visual appeal, making it suitable for broader consumer engagement.",
