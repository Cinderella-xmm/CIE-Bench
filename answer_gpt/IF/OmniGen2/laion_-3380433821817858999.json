        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features several distinct sections, each with its own set of visuals and text that describe different phases of a specific action or process. These sections include various illustrations and written information, suggesting multiple steps are explained. When combined with the title 'MASTER THE POWER JUMP', this structured format reflects a typical multi-panel infographic style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a panel showing a simple figure in a kneeling position with bent arms pulled back, labeled as \"Step 1: Positioning: Kneel with bent arms back\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the first panel shows an illustration labeled as 'POSITINING', which showcases a figure with arms pulled back and bent, similar to a kneeling posture. However, the text specifically stating 'Step 1: Positioning: Kneel with bent arms back' does not exist here.",

      "question": "Is there a panel showing an explosive leaping motion with visual cues of propulsion (e.g., motion lines, energy burst), labeled as \"Step 2: Leap Attack: Propel using core strength\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has sections labeled 'LEAP ATTACK' and 'PRDC CORE STROGH'. These suggest a focus on initiating a jump, emphasizing core strength. However, there are no explicit motion lines or energy bursts shown, nor is there a label 'Step 2: Leap Attack: Propel using core strength'.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a section labeled 'MIDCâ€¢ATIIN TIGHLY', with a figure seemingly airborne and tucking knees tightly, corresponding to the concept of mid-air adjustment. Nonetheless, it doesn't contain the specific wording 'Step 3: Mid-Air Adjustment: Tuck knees tightly'.",
