        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements are encased in a glass dome with a round base, which is a characteristic feature of a snow globe. Based on world knowledge, a snow globe typically contains a miniaturized scene or object, covered by a clear spherical casing. This design replicates such features with the inclusion of the Colosseum and Big Ben inside, thus confirming the conversion into a snow globe design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, reflections and highlights on the glass dome of the snow globe indicate interaction with warm lighting. This interaction creates areas of gentle light and subdued glow, demonstrating the effect of ambient lighting reflecting off the glass surface, consistent with a warm lighting environment.",
