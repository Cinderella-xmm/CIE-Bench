    "Question": "Q1: Is the image presented within a visible hand-carved wooden frame that encloses the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a wooden box encloses the artwork, suggesting a carefully crafted boundary or frame for the scene. The box's edges and corners are visible, indicating a defined structure typical of a handcrafted wooden frame.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the boat, water, and hills depicted as separate, layered cutout elements rather than a continuous photographic scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boat, water, and hills are clearly distinct elements, as evidenced by their varying depths and cutout appearances. This suggests they are layered components rather than a single integrated photograph, promoting a stylized dimensional effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the boat exhibit aged wood textures such as cracks, grain patterns, and weathered surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boat appears smooth and polished, lacking the typical signs of aged wood like cracks or weathering. Rather than rustic textures, the surfaces are sleek, indicative of an intentional stylization rather than structural wear.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the distant hills rendered in soft, pastel blue gradients instead of realistic green or gray tones?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background hills are observed in soft blue hues that transition smoothly, conveying a pastel aesthetic. Unlike realistic hills with complex textures or natural colors, these gradients emphasize artistic and minimalist choices.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there visible, delicate droplet-like etchings on a transparent layer above the water surface to mimic ripples?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface shows uniform, stylized wave patterns that are not mimicking realistic ripples or droplets. The design emphasizes smooth curves rather than intricate, realistic etchings, reinforcing an artistic representation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the foreground (boat), midground (water), and background (hills) appear as distinct, physically separated layers contributing to depth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boat, water, and hills are layered separately, each occupying different planes within the box, contributing to a sense of depth through physical separation. This approach, common in layered dioramas, effectively creates dimensional space.",
    "answer": "Yes"
