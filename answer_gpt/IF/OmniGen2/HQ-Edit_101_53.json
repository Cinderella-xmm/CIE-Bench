      "question": "Is the pug depicted as a carved wooden sculpture rather than a living dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pug has a distinct appearance of being carved from wood, characterized by the smooth, shiny surface typical of polished wood. This appearance differs drastically from a living dog’s natural fur, which is textured and soft. The pug in Image B lacks the life-like elements of fur, skin, and expression, all contributing to the impression that it is a wooden sculpture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the fur been replaced with smooth, polished wood grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the pug in Image B is uniform and reflects light in a consistent manner, resembling smooth, polished wood. The presence of visible wood grain patterns further indicates that the fur of a real pug, which would appear soft and textured, has been replaced by a polished wood texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors of the sculpture consistent with walnut tones, maintaining the original pug's color pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The coloring of the pug sculpture in Image B features warm, earthy tones akin to walnut wood, characterized by a deep, reddish-brown hue. These tones align with the common color patterns found in living pugs, such as the fawn or apricot colors, thus maintaining the original pug’s color scheme albeit in a wooden form.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and features represented by etched or carved lines rather than soft skin folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the pug, such as the wrinkles and facial structure, are depicted using carved grooves and lines. This technique gives the appearance of etched or carved lines, contrasting with the soft, pliable nature of skin folds seen in a living dog in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the wooden pug placed on a simple black base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden pug is positioned on a plain, circular black base. The base is minimalistic and does not distract from the wooden sculpture, serving primarily as a pedestal to support and showcase the pug.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The simple black base under the wooden pug in Image B creates a strong contrast with the rich, warm tones and detailed craftsmanship of the sculpture. This contrast helps to highlight the sculpture's intricate wood grain and carved details, drawing attention to the artistry involved.",
