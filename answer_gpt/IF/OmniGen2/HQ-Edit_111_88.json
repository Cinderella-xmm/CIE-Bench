    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the dancing woman appear as if made of stained glass with distinct panel-like divisions and dark outlines resembling lead came?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is surrounded by an outline and geometric divisions similar to stained glass designs. These divisions create a segmented appearance typical of stained glass artwork seen in images like those on church windows, where the lead came provides distinct dark outlines separating colored glass panels.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the woman’s pose identical to the original, with one leg lifted and arms positioned dynamically as in the source image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the woman with one leg lifted and arms positioned dynamically, identical to Image A. Both images depict the same pose, indicating the dancer's movement and vitality.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the woman’s garments and body adorned with flowing, curvilinear lines and intricate geometric patterns consistent with Art Nouveau design principles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the garment displays geometric patterns that are consistent with traditional designs rather than the fluid, curvilinear patterns typical of Art Nouveau. The art maintains vibrant patterns but does not incorporate flowing lines typical of Art Nouveau.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees and huts in the background redesigned with smooth, curving lines and organic shapes typical of Art Nouveau, rather than naturalistic forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has elements framed within a stained glass-like design, showing strong outlines and defined divisions. However, the trees and huts display a more geometric or segmented appearance instead of the fluid and organic forms typical of Art Nouveau.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall color scheme of the image muted and iridescent, resembling colored glass with soft transitions and low contrast, rather than vibrant, saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses bright and vibrant colors that are bold and saturated, consistent with vibrant stained glass but not resembling the muted and iridescent qualities typical of traditional stained glass with soft transitions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the entire image exhibit a sense of continuous, flowing ornamentation and balanced movement, with decorative details linking the dancer and environment in a unified design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B maintains a stained glass effect with distinct outlines and geometric divisions, it lacks the continuous flowing ornamentation typical of unified Art Nouveau designs that seamlessly blend the dancer and environment into a singular design.",
