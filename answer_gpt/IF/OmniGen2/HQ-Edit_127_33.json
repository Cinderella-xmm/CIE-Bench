      "question": "Are the topiary structures transformed into sentient plant creatures with visible facial features or limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the topiary structures remain as normal, well-maintained trees without any transformation into creatures. There is no indication of facial features or limbs that would suggest they are sentient beings. The visual cues of upright, dense foliage are consistent with traditional topiary designs, not sentient creatures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the fountain feature water that appears crystalline and transparent, with glowing or luminous rocks beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fountain water does appear clearer and more vibrant than typical water, suggesting a crystalline appearance. However, there are no visible glowing or luminous rocks beneath the water. The light emphasizes the clarity of the water, but there is no indication of an unnatural luminescent effect from rocks.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small, butterfly-like creatures with iridescent wings visibly fluttering around the garden?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays two butterfly-like creatures near the fountain area. These butterflies have visible wings and give an appearance of fluttering, which aligns with the description of butterfly-like creatures with iridescent qualities. The distinct shapes and placement confirm their presence.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there vine-like structures forming spiral paths that rise upward from the garden toward the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the garden features well-defined hedges and other greenery, but lacks any vine-like structures forming spiral paths that rise toward the sky. The design of the garden includes structured paths and topiary, not upward spiraling vines.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hedges exhibit an otherworldly appearance such as glowing outlines, shimmering surfaces, or ethereal lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not present any hedges displaying glowing outlines or shimmering surfaces. Although the garden is brightly lit and colorful, with vibrant hues, the appearance remains grounded and does not suggest any ethereal or otherworldly lighting effects. The appearance is vivid but not supernatural.",
