      "question": "Are the cheetah figures replaced with gold-finished perfume bottles that maintain their original seated poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are visually identified as cheetahs with a gold finish. They retain the same seated pose as typical cheetah sculptures, commonly used for decorative purposes. The gold look enhances the perception of luxury and opulence, consistent with high-end packaging design, like that often seen in perfume bottles. This understanding is based on the typical association of gold-finished items with luxury goods.",

      "question": "Has the botanical center been replaced with a translucent, green-tinted glass façade that has a cascading downward appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object appears as a translucent structure with a green tint, suggesting the use of glass material. The vertical lines and the gradient effect from the lighting give the impression of a cascading downward appearance, which is often used in modern and elegant display designs. This change adds to the overall sophistication of the setup.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is clearly visible text labeled as 'Savanna Essence' on both bases of the objects. The font used is a chic serif style, which is frequently used in luxury branding to convey elegance and class. Serif fonts are traditionally associated with high-end products because of their readability and timeless design.",

      "question": "Does the edited image convey an elegant and luxurious aesthetic consistent with a high-end retail perfume display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses elements like gold finishes on the cheetah figures, a translucent green glass façade, and a sophisticated serif font. These elements are characteristic of luxury retail displays, such as those found in high-end perfume stores. The lighting further enhances this perception, creating reflections and a warm, inviting ambiance.",

      "question": "Are the two gold-finished perfume bottles symmetrically positioned on either side of the central glass façade, preserving the original spatial arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of objects maintains symmetry, with one gold-finished cheetah figure placed on each side of the central glass façade. This spatial arrangement mirrors the layout found in Image A, reflecting a deliberate balance and order typical of an elegant display. Symmetry is often employed in product presentations to reinforce structure and harmony.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the objects in Image B appears to be a reflective surface, as there are visible reflections of both the gold-finished cheetah figures and the central glass façade. This reflective property contributes to the luxurious aesthetic, highlighting the objects' forms and the interplay of light, which is a common feature in high-end displays to enhance visual appeal.",
