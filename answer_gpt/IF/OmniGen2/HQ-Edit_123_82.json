      "question": "Is the woman's figure stylized in a cartoon-like manner with exaggerated proportions or simplified features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's figure appears more stylized with smoother and cleaner lines, creating a cartoon-like effect. The figure is simplified, with consistent texture and a polished look that diverges from the natural realism of a photo. This stylization often includes exaggerated or idealized proportions typical of illustration or cartoon styles.",

      "question": "Are there visible gold embroidery details added to the red dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red dress features intricate gold embroidery details around the waist and neckline. These details are not present in a typical plain dress and are added to enhance the visual appeal, often seen in stylized or high-quality illustrations to give a sense of luxury or ornamentation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the butterfly wings significantly larger than they were in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the wings in Image B to those in Image A, the butterfly wings are disproportionately larger in Image B, further emphasizing the stylized appearance and suggesting a fantastical element. The larger size surpasses natural proportions, indicating artistic exaggeration.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings lack highly detailed textures like fine veins or layered patterns, which are typical in realistic depictions. Instead, they are depicted with bold colors and smooth shading, focusing on visual impact rather than intricate details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings do not display any text or calendar-related information. Instead, the calendar months appear to be displayed around the periphery of the image, framed by the surrounding design elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the entire composition encased within a wooden frame, which is accented by floral inlay patterns. These design elements enhance the decorative and collectible aesthetic of the image, setting it apart from the casual setting of Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the final image include design elements (such as wood grain, floral patterns, or embossed text) that suggest it is intended as a collectible item?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of a wooden frame, floral inlays, and the overall presentation of Image B suggest it is designed as a collectible item. These elements are commonly associated with items intended for display and preservation, rather than everyday use.",
