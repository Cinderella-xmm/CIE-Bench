      "question": "Is the background of each sticker transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By observing Image B, we can see that the stickers have solid colored backgrounds, not transparent ones. Typically, transparent backgrounds allow for the image to blend seamlessly with any underlying image or color, but here each sticker clearly has a non-transparent, opaque background.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stickers arranged in a 3x3 layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the stickers arranged in a 4x3 grid, which means there are four rows and three columns. A 3x3 layout would have only three rows and three columns.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all stickers maintain a square 1:1 aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By analyzing the shapes of the stickers, most appear square, but one sticker has an outline that extends significantly beyond the usual square borders, indicating it's not a perfect square. The presence of non-square boxes suggests that not all stickers have a 1:1 aspect ratio.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers in Image B feature characters with large heads and small bodies, which is characteristic of the Chibi style in anime. Additionally, the colors used are bright and vibrant, aligning with the cartoon aesthetic often seen in Ghibli-inspired art.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining each of the stickers, the characters appear to be engaged in slightly different poses and actions related to snowboarding. The poses vary in terms of angles and motions, indicating distinct snowboarding actions or scenarios.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In each sticker, the characters are fully depicted without any missing or cut-off parts. All body parts including limbs and facial expressions are displayed wholly within the borders of each sticker.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection, each sticker seems to have a white outline following the perimeter of the design, providing a consistent border across all stickers.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The stickers follow a cohesive design without any elements that appear added or separate from the main design of each sticker. They seem well-contained within their respective borders with no random elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows that there is no text included within the design of any individual sticker. Any text present is in the header above the stickers, not in the stickers themselves.",
