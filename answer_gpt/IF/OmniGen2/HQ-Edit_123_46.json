        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the basketball player is depicted holding two balls indicating a mid-dribble motion, but neither ball is near the ground as would be typical in a dribble pose. This suggests the motion is different from a common dribbling posture.",
