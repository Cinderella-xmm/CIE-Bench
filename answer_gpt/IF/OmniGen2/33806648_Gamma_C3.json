    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the rock arch as a recognizable stone guardian creature with anthropomorphic or guardian-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arch is depicted as a circular structure embedded with crystals and runic symbols. This gives it a mystical appearance but does not impart any anthropomorphic or guardian-like features typically associated with creatures. The rock structure serves as more an inanimate magical portal than a creature.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible crystalline structures growing along the curved edges of the arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows numerous sharp, blue crystalline structures prominently along the edges of the arch. These crystals are visually distinct and add an element of fantasy to the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there luminous, vein-like lines running across the surface of the arch that follow naturalistic branching patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display luminous, vein-like lines running along the structure. Instead, it shows runic symbols with a glow around them, and these symbols are uniformly arranged rather than following branching patterns. Therefore, the absence of vein-like lines leads to this conclusion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the original arch outline been replaced with skeletal, wing-like protrusions extending from the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's outline of the arch features crystalline structures but does not resemble skeletal or wing-like protrusions. These additions serve more as decorations enhancing the mystical aspect rather than forming skeletal extensions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there clearly visible runic symbols engraved or etched onto the inner surface of the arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, runic symbols are clearly visible on the inner surface of the arch. They are distinct, forming a ring around a central glowing light, suggesting a magical or fantastical function.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a glowing orb positioned centrally within the arch, acting as a source of radiance and energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a glowing, radiant source of light centrally in the arch. This resembles an orb emitting powerful luminescence, indicating energy presence and magical characteristics.",
