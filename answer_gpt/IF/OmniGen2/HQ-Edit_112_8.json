      "question": "Is the phrase 'Stories Through Time' present in the image using an elegant serif typeface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text visible at the top reads 'STORIES THROUGHE' in a serif typeface, which typically consists of strokes at the end of the letters, giving it an elegant appearance often used for formal and historical designs. Given the serif style, which is designed to evoke a sense of tradition and elegance, it suggests a refined appearance. Despite the presence of the typo 'THROUGHE', the font style matches the described elegant serif typeface.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text 'Stories Through Time' rendered in a distressed gold color that matches the typewriterâ€™s metallic tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color used for 'STORIES THROUGHE' is indeed a distressed gold, exhibiting variations in color that give it a worn or vintage look similar to tarnished metal. This choice complements the typewriter, which appears in shades of brown and sepia suggesting aged metal. However, there is a typo in the text, making it 'STORIES THROUGHE' instead of 'Stories Through Time'.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a consistent sepia-toned color scheme, giving it an aged, vintage look reminiscent of historical documents and posters. Sepia filters are commonly used to evoke nostalgia by casting a warm, brownish tint over images. This warmth appears consistently across every visual element in Image B, suggesting a unified application of the sepia effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are illustrated pages with swirling patterns near the typewriter, positioned so that they seem to be emerging or floating away. These pages are designed to resemble translucent sheets, often used to give an ethereal or symbolic representation of stories coming to life. The positioning enhances the effect of stories actively emerging from the typewriter.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a border with intricate and symmetrical designs typical of the Art Deco style, which often features geometric shapes and curves to add sophistication. These borders often frame elements to give posters and prints a distinct vintage and stylish appearance. The detail and symmetry align with characteristics associated with Art Deco designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B combines several visual elements: sepia color tones for an aged look, the distressed gold serif font for elegance, swirling pages to represent stories, and an Art Deco border for vintage sophistication.
