      "question": "Is the entire image rendered in a hand-painted watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues such as the smooth transitions in color, the vibrant yet soft palette, and the apparent absence of intricate texture detail suggest a hand-painted watercolor effect. This is different from the photographic realism typically found in photos. This style is characterized by lighter, airy washes of color and a more impressionistic approach. Therefore, based on these observations, the entire image does indeed appear to be rendered in a hand-painted watercolor style.",

      "question": "Is the foreground woman depicted in greater detail compared to the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground woman is portrayed with more vivid colors and clearer lines compared to other elements of the image. The dress, posture, and glass are more pronounced, drawing more attention and suggesting more detail. In contrast, the background figures have less contrasting details and softer colors, emphasizing the primary focus on the foreground woman.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the background figures represented with light-colored linework and faint washes rather than detailed rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the background figures using a more abstract approach with less emphasis on individual features. The linework is lighter and there are faint color washes without strong details or contrasts, which gives an illustrative rather than detailed appearance, typical of watercolor media where emphasis is not on intricate details.",

      "question": "Does the woman appear to be elegantly raising her glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman in the foreground holds her glass up in a poised manner, typical of a gesture made during a toast or display. The context and her posture suggest an elegant motion. The edited image uses soft lighting and clear outlines to accentuate this action, supporting the notion of elegance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B is placed prominently in the foreground with vivid colors and discernible details compared to the more subdued background figures. Her central positioning and the use of lighter and softer background tones enhance her prominence, making her the focal point of the image composition.",
