      "question": "Is there a person's hand visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, we can clearly see a hand holding the keychain. This information is conveyed by the visible fingers and the way the hand is grasping the keychain, which indicates human anatomy. The presence of the hand is straightforward based on the visual evidence.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the keychain feature a chibi-style depiction of the dog from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in the edited image depicts a cartoonish, chibi-style character of what appears to be a dog. The style is characterized by exaggeratedly cute features such as large eyes and a simplified form. To assess if it's the same dog as in the original image, I would focus on specific traits like fur color and shape. The dog in the original image is a Yorkshire Terrier with long fur, while the chibi style on the keychain merges these characteristics into a stylized representation incorporating bright colors and exaggerated features. Despite the change in representation, the fundamental dog-like characteristics align with the original image.",

      "question": "Is the keychain made of soft rubber with thick black outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a keychain that appears to be made of a soft material, likely rubber, given its matte finish and visual texture. The design features thick black outlines, typical of chibi-style animated art, which enhances its appearance and separation of colors. These cues suggest a soft rubber material commonly used for such keychains.",

      "question": "Is the keychain connected to a tiny silver keyring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in the edited image is attached to a metal ring, which, based on its appearance, seems to be a typical small keyring. The metallic shine and size suggest it's silver, which is a common choice for key rings due to its durability and aesthetic appeal.",

      "question": "Is the background plain and neutral without any additional elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the edited image is plain and neutral, consisting of a flat, undistracting color without any other defining elements or textures. This background choice serves to highlight the keychain as the central focus of the image. The lack of detail in the background ensures that attention remains on the keychain and the hand holding it.",
