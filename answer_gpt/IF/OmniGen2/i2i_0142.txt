    "Question": "Q1: Is there a top view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the baseball appears from a frontal perspective, emphasizing its round shape and distinct red stitching.

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a side view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the baseballs are represented in a way that shows both their roundness and stitching, but not from a traditional side view which would be oriented orthogonally to the top or bottom of a sphere. The glove's angle also does not represent a true side view but rather a frontal interior view emphasizing the pocket and finger openings of the glove.",
