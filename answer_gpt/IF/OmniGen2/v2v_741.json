      "question": "Is the setting in Panel 1 a chaotic workspace with computer screens, stray coffee cups, and tangled wires?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Panel 1 of Image B, there are visual markers indicating a workspace setup, such as multiple computer screens, a desk, and cables.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the visible portions of the workspace setting do not markedly differ in terms of tidiness compared to Panel 1. The character is interacting with a computer, and there appears to be code on the screen, but it is not particularly described as glowing or cascading in an eye-catching manner. Therefore, based on visual insights, the desk is not portrayed as significantly cleaner or with dynamic visuals on the screen.",
