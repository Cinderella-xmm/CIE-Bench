      "question": "Has the clock been designed with a metallic material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock has a metallic appearance with a shiny, smooth silver or chrome finish. This suggests that the frame of the clock is designed to resemble metal material. This observation is derived from the distinct metallic coloring and reflective texture visible in the image, common characteristics of metal objects.",

      "question": "Does the badge pendant preserve the minimalist circular frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frame of the clock in Image B has a simple, circular shape without any additional elaborate design elements, maintaining the minimalist aesthetic. This observation is based on recognizing the straightforward circular layout and minimal markings which align with minimalist design principles.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the proportions of the clock hands been preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock hands appear proportional relative to the size of the clock, akin to those found in a typical wall clock. The hands themselves have a standard length where the minute hand is longer than the hour hand, consistent with typical clock designs. Comparing this with Image A indicates no significant change in the proportions of the clock hands.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible feature such as a loop or hook indicating the pendant can function as a keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a loop or ring attached to the top of the clock, serving as a keychain holder. This feature is distinctly visible, connecting the clock to a keychain ring, indicating its functionality as a keychain accessory.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there no additional elements besides those necessary for converting it into a metallic badge pendant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "Besides the metallic frame and the keychain attachment, Image B does not show any other extraneous elements added to the clock. The modifications made are solely for the purpose of converting the clock into a keychain pendant, preserving its simplicity and original design characteristics.",
