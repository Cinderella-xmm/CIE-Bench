    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figure rendered as a bronze sculpture with a metallic surface finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B clearly exhibits a bronze-like appearance with a reflective metallic surface, which is characteristic of a sculpture made from bronze. This observation is derived from the uniform golden sheen across the limbs, attire, and base of the figure, suggesting a bronze sculpture with a metallic finish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the limbs visibly elongated compared to natural human proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs appear to be longer and more slender than average human proportions, which aligns with artistic interpretations to convey elegance or other artistic styles. This conclusion is made by examining the exaggerated length and narrowness of the arms and legs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the legs form smooth, curved shapes that suggest dynamic movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The legs in Image B are posed in a way that renders them as smooth and curvy, extending forward and backward in a dynamic pose, which implies a sense of movement and gracefulness. By observing the posture and the way the attire adheres to the contours, dynamic movement is suggested.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have all floral elements been replaced with geometric patterns consistent with Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains floral elements attached to the boots and around the figure, similar to Image A but rendered in a way that complements the metallic theme. No geometric Art Deco patterns replace these flowers, maintaining the original floral motif.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image rendered in metallic tones while preserving the original color scheme (teal, red, pink)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B are reinterpreted in metallic tones, with a bronze finish over teal attire and the other elements, yet preserving the original color scheme. The bronze enhances the teal, and other accents align with the original color palette.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background a solid, uniform turquoise color matching the overall aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is indeed a solid turquoise, which complements the sculptureâ€™s teal color and overall image aesthetic. This color choice creates a harmonious backdrop for the bronze figure, enhancing its visual appeal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the adornments on the figure composed of symmetrical, angular, or repetitive geometric motifs typical of Art Deco style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The adornments visible on the figure in Image B mainly retain their floral aesthetics rather than being replaced by geometric or angular motifs typical of Art Deco. The pearls wrap around at curves, aligning with organic rather than geometric styles.",
