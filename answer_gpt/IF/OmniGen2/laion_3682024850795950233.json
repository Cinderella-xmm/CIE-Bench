      "question": "Is the title \"The Saga of the Heroic Bread Warrior\" displayed prominently in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title is displayed prominently at the top of the image as 'THE SAGA OF THE HEREAD WARRIER.' While the text uses a playful and bold style that is typical for titles meant to capture attention, there is a typographical error in 'HEREAD WARRIER' instead of 'Heroic Bread Warrior.' This suggests an attempt to create a fun and engaging headline, but it is not exactly the original title mentioned.",
