      "question": "Has the original desk and character structure remained unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desk and the character arrangement are visually consistent with common portrayals of 'The Last Supper' painting by Leonardo da Vinci. The individuals seated at the table, as well as the layout of items on the table, suggests that the original structure has not been altered. This is a typical scene where characters are positioned around a long dining table, maintaining the historical look.",

      "question": "Has a modern man been added to the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the inclusion of a figure on the right side dressed in modern clothing, which contrasts with the other figures who are in historical attire typical of the time of Jesus. The posture, style, and context of this figure, based on its appearance, imply that he is a modern addition to the image.",

    {

      "question": "Is the modern man wearing formal attire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure on the right in Image B is wearing a dark suit and white shirt which are generally considered formal attire in modern times. This attire contrasts with the traditional robes of the figures in the original painting, leading to the conclusion that he is dressed formally.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The modern man on the right side of Image B is extending his arm, and in his hand, he is holding an object that visually resembles a glass, suggesting the action of raising a glass.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the modern figure appears in the rightmost portion of the image, which was previously more vacant in the context of Image A (without providing this explicit knowledge). His position suggests he was added to an area that traditionally did not have a full figure in the original composition.",
