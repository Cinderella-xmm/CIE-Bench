      "question": "Is the background of the image now a weathered pirate map with aged parchment texture and sepia-toned colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the background significantly differs from a natural setting onboard a ship seen in Image A. Instead, Image B showcases a background resembling a pirate map with an aged parchment texture in sepia-toned colors. This can be identified by the visual cues such as the the faded yellowish hue, irregular patterns, and a circular map sketch, which are typical of a classic aged map appearance.",

      "question": "Is the treasure chest depicted as a central element in the image using detailed ink sketch style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the treasure chest remains the central element, as indicated by its prominent placement in the center of the image. However, the style is not consistent with the ink sketch technique. It retains a painted or digitally rendered look similar to the original, rather than a framed ink sketch style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ropes and nautical elements used as decorative borders around the edges of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents decorative borders around the edges formed by ropes. This is emphasized by the presence of ropes tied in knots at each corner, providing a nautical theme border. This contrasts with Image A, where ropes are part of the ship's scenery rather than decorative borders.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are parts of the ship's mast and sails visible and integrated into the corners of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the corners do not show elements from the ship's mast or sails as they are primarily occupied by decorative motifs and map elements. The corners are instead filled with images of ships and rope knots. Image A, however, includes parts of the ship like masts and sails within the corners naturally fitted into the ship setting.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a legend present in the image with symbols for coins, gems, and pottery labeled in bold, ancient-style typography?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks a clear legend for symbols such as coins, gems, and pottery labeled in ancient-style typography. While there is text present, it is primarily decorative and does not correspond to a typical legend format seen in maps where symbols are explained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a compass rose located in the bottom-right corner, aligning with the description given. Its design includes metallic hues similar to the jewels and coins depicted, enriching the nautical pirate map theme.",

      "question": "Are there subtle, intricate motifs such as sea monsters visible within the map design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't show subtle motifs of sea monsters clearly within the map's design. The decorative elements are mainly filled with ships and ropes, and complex details akin to sea monsters are absent. The visual presentation of the map lacks these intricate mythological motifs.",
