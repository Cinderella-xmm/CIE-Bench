        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a distinct bottle shape with a rounded bottom and slender neck, which is characteristic of a perfume bottle design. This contrasts with the statue form in Image A, suggesting a transformation from the statue's shape to a bottle structure in Image B.",
