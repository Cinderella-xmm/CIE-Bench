      "question": "Is the entire body of the truck composed of layered, reflective crystal planes resembling emerald and jade facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is depicted with a material that mimics the appearance of crystal, taking on a vivid green color similar to emerald or jade. The body appears to be made of layered crystal-like planes, showcasing reflective qualities. This gives the impression of the truck body being composed of crystalline materials with an aesthetic reminiscent of precious stones.",

      "question": "Are the wheels transparent and made of quartz with visible internal crystalline patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels of the truck appear to be transparent, suggesting that they could be made of a material like quartz. The internal patterns visible within the wheels simulate crystalline structures, aligning with the appearance one might expect from a quartz composition.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is positioned on a surface that looks like a smooth, polished, white material, closely resembling marble.

      "question": "Do the cabin and body surfaces feature angular, faceted crystal planes that reflect and refract light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfaces of the truck in Image B exhibit angular and faceted qualities typical of cut crystals. These facets reflect and refract light, creating variations in color and brightness across the surface, which is characteristic of cut glass or crystal.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The truck in Image B maintains the same overall shape, size, and structural layout as depicted in Image A, ensuring that the proportions and general design elements (such as the position and size of the cabin, cargo area, and wheels) are consistent with the original military truck design.",
