      "question": "Has the hummingbird been transformed into a non-biological, ethereal entity resembling a garden spirit rather than a realistic bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hummingbird possesses vivid, fantastical colors such as bright blues, purples, and greens, giving it a more surreal or ethereal appearance. This color palette mimics what one might consider a magical or spirit-like entity rather than the more muted, natural tones seen in real hummingbirds. However, its form remains biologically consistent with a bird, retaining wings, body, and a beak, preventing it from being classified purely as spirit or non-biological entity. Image A displays a hummingbird with more realistic colors, aligning it closely with a biological bird. The transformation in Image B adds magical qualities but does not completely remove biological aspects.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wings of the hummingbird appear as iridescent, glass-like structures that display a full rainbow spectrum of shimmering colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the hummingbird are depicted with bright, rainbow colors, including transitions from blue to pink, purple, orange, and green, which contribute to the appearance of iridescence. The colors suggest glass-like qualities but retain the structure of typical hummingbird wings. This aligns with a fantastical interpretation rather than biological realism. Image A displays wings with natural feather patterns and colors, without the apparent glass-like, rainbow spectrum. Comparing both, Image B's wings achieve the described shimmering effect.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the body feathers of the hummingbird replaced with glowing, petal-like structures that emit light or have a luminous appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the hummingbird is shown with bright, smooth colors that suggest luminescence akin to glowing petals, with a cohesive mix of blue, green, and pink hues blending seamlessly. This contrasts with the feathery texture typically seen in real birds. Image A shows the hummingbird with detailed feather patterns and more muted tones appropriate for an organic bird. The difference indicates that Image B employs colors and textures that suggest glowing, petal-like features on the bird's body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the beak been replaced with a transparent, crystalline spout from which a golden or honey-colored liquid (floral nectar) is visibly flowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the hummingbird with a realistic beak shape and coloration appropriate for an organic bird. There is no visual indication of a transparent, crystalline replacement or visible liquid flow. Image A similarly depicts a standard hummingbird beak. Both images confirm a lack of transformation relating to the beak, maintaining traditional biological characteristics.",

      "question": "Does the tail of the hummingbird consist of green, leafy vines with small blossoms growing along them, blending into the surrounding garden?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hummingbird's tail in Image B retains a sleek, feathered appearance and does not visually represent green, leafy vines. There are no small blossoms along its tail or evidence of integration into the garden environment through botanical transformation. Image A also shows a typical feathered tail structure, confirming the absence of any vine-like transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the transformed hummingbird visually integrated into the garden environment, with colors, textures, and elements (like vines and petals) harmonizing with the surrounding flora?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the hummingbird has vivid, ethereal colors, these tones complement the bright flowers in the garden scene, creating visual harmony between the bird and its environment. The seamless vibrant colors suggest a fantasy integration, despite retaining a biological bird form. Image A reflects natural coloration and does not exhibit the same fantastical visual integration into its surroundings. Image B's fantastical color scheme aligns it with garden spirit imagery.",
