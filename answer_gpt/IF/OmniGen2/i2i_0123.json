      "question": "Has the timer on the left been replaced with an illustration of a robotic dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no parking meter visible on the left side. Instead, a robotic dog appears next to the remaining parking meter on the right. In Image A, we see two parking meters. The analysis of Image B confirms the absence of the left parking meter, replaced by the robotic dog. Therefore, the robotic dog appears instead of the timer on the left.",

      "question": "Is the robotic dog clearly shown holding a coin in its paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robotic dog prominently displays a large coin in its left paw, featuring a dollar symbol. From the visual cues, the coin is emphasized, and the dog's pose intentionally extends the paw with the coin toward the viewer, facilitating identification. The image clearly conveys the intended depiction of the robotic dog holding a coin.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the parking meter still display billing information such as numbers and labels in a legible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parking meter next to the robotic dog continues to show numbers, text, and labels, similar to its portrayal in Image A. The numbers '1995' are visible, along with other labels, validating the continued display of billing information in a legible fashion. Therefore, the analysis supports that the parking meter maintains legability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the overall shape and structure of the parking meter remained consistent with the original design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parking meter design remains unchanged compared to Image A. Both images feature the meter's structure, including the rounded top and rectangular body with coin slots and display area. The overall form and functional components are consistent between the images, confirming that the parking meterâ€™s structure is unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the robotic dog designed with features such as metallic textures or mechanical parts, making it identifiable as a robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a robotic dog with characteristics indicative of robotic design, such as metallic textures and articulated mechanical joints. Elements like the segmented limbs and stylized eyes contribute to its robotic appearance. These features are typical of robot toys or figures, enabling recognition of the robotic nature of the dog through familiar visual cues.",
