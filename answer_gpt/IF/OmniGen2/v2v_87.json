      "question": "Is there a classic LEGO-style minifigure present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a miniature model of an elephant and a backpack. The base of this setup resembles a LEGO-like structure with the signature studded appearance around the edges, but there is no LEGO-style minifigure present. The scene contains a miniature version of the elephant and a backpack, which are not LEGO minifigures. LEGO minifigures are usually characterized by human-like figures with standardized sizes and shapes, but this is not visible in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the elephant in the edited image feature earthy hues accented with a rich red tone similar to the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant displays a color scheme consistent with lifelike representations of elephants, featuring shades of brown and not displaying any rich red tones. The backpack next to it is of a rich red color that stands out from the elephant's earthy color. Therefore, the elephant does not have any red accents similar to the backpack.",

      "question": "Is the scene encased within a transparent glass cube in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature scene of an elephant and a backpack enclosed in a transparent glass or plastic case. The encasement is visibly clear and covers the models entirely, which is suggestive of a display case setup. This visual cue indicates that the scene is encased in a transparent cube.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the miniature rest on a matte black base with silver details in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base that supports the miniature scene appears to be constructed with black Lego-like pieces but does not feature any apparent silver details. The studs on what resembles a LEGO base are uniformly colored, adhering to the black theme. Thus, the base does not have any silver details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there an engraved nameplate on the base reading \"African Elephant\" with biological classification information beneath in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a base with an engraved nameplate that reads \"African Elephant\". Below the name, there appears to be additional text similar to biological classification information, though the text beneath is not entirely clear or legible. However, the presence of a nameplate with such details is evident and aligns with typical displays.",
