        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly looks soft and adorned with fabric materials, evidenced by the appearance of textured, cloth-like surfaces suggesting a plush or velvety texture rather than the hard, reflective nature of metal or gemstones.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
