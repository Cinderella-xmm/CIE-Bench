      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a cartoon-like illustration with exaggerated features typical of chibi style, such as a large head and simplified anatomy, fitting a tennis theme with a tennis ball and court elements. This change confirms the transformation into a chibi sticker.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
