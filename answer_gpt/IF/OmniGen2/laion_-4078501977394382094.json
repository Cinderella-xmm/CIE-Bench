        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title of the comic strip in Image B should be prominently visible if it were 'Desert Adventure Chronicles'. Based on the given image, no title fitting this description is visible at the top or any prominent location. The panels contain text bubbles discussing the desert and road but lack a central title embossing this particular phrase.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Panel 1 of Image B, the green van's roof is flat and does not feature any upward tilt similar to a hat tip. The roof carries a roof rack, which is a traditional horizontal structure, confirming no hat tip resemblance.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text bubble in Panel 1 of Image B reads 'Ah, the open DESERT ROUAD CHORILES.' rather than 'Ah, the open road calls!'. The sentence is not correctly spelled, indicating an intentional mix-up or humor involved in the text choice.",
