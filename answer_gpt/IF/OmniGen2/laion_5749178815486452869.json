      "question": "Is the green field depicted as a floating island disconnected from any ground or horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green field is shaped like an island with a visible edge that is submerged. It gives the visual perception of being a floating landmass, similar to common depictions of floating islands in fantasy. This is emphasized by the absence of any continuous ground or horizon, looking like it is suspended in space. This contrasts with the typical continuous land or horizon found in grounded landscapes.",

      "question": "Are the yellow and red flowers significantly more vibrant and saturated in color compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the flowers are depicted in realistic tones that mirror natural coloring, while in Image B, despite stylization, the bright and striking colors remain consistent, avoiding a significant difference in saturation and vibrancy. Enhanced saturation or vibrancy isn't apparent beyond stylized design, maintaining a coherent color scheme with the original's saturation.",

      "question": "Has the moon been replaced with an oversized apple in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible large red apple with leaves is clearly apparent against the sky, occupying a space that could suggest replacement of celestial features such as a moon commonly seen in decorative, surreal works. Image A features a moon in the sky that is noticeably substituted by the apple in Image B. Such a depiction is not typical and ties into a whimsical, surreal artistic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the bee and butterfly been replaced with stylized, playful, non-realistic motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the bee and butterfly appear in their naturalistic forms, whereas in Image B, they are absent and the portrayal shifts entirely to a surreal landscape devoid of direct analogs or similar fun motifs of those original elements. Consequently, this indicates a replacement by omission or decoration typical to surreal rearrangements rather than direct playful substitutes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the tree been replaced with a hollow geometric structure (e.g., cube, pyramid, or sphere) with visible interior or transparent parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a distinct geometric structure is apparent resting on the green floating island reminiscent of a hollow arch with visible interior space. The original scene in Image A features a typical tree but in Image B, there's a transformative portrayal aligning commonly with abstract representations by swapping natural for constructed forms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the starry night sky with visible stars and cosmic depth still present and dominant in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is depicted with a deep blue filled with twinkling stars, invoking a vivid cosmic scene much like Image A. The stars visibly articulation space depths and provide a dramatic backdrop typical in fantastical notions of the universe above. It maintains the celestial aspect similar to the original despite changes elsewhere in artistic elements.",
