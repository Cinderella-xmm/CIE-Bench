    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the building facade now appear as an organic, alien-like structure rather than a conventional architectural design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) depicts a structure that resembles an otherworldly or alien-like form, characterized by its distinct tentacle-like appendages and unconventional texture and lighting. This appearance contrasts sharply with traditional architectural designs, suggesting a transformation to an organic or alien structure. Therefore, based solely on the visual cues presented in Image B, it clearly appears to be an alien-like structure.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the curved elements of the building transformed into distinct tentacle-like appendages extending from the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B has distinct tentacle-like features that are characteristic of jellyfish or cephalopods. These appendages extend outwardly and are a prominent feature of the structure, diverging from conventional architectural elements and resembling an organic entity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are fibrous, strand-like textures visibly applied across sections of the buildingâ€™s exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the structure does not exhibit any fibrous or strand-like textures. Instead, it has a smooth, bulbous shape that resembles the body of a jellyfish. The texture looks solid and glossy rather than fibrous.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have all window surfaces been replaced with translucent, membrane-like panels that appear soft and non-rigid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no visible window surfaces resembling conventional building windows in Image B. The dome of the structure is solid and does not show any signs of transparent or translucent window constructions, much less any soft or non-rigid membrane-like panels.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the metal surface detailed with overlapping, iridescent scale-like patterns that reflect multiple colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the structure in Image B is depicted with an iridescent and scale-like texture, often associated with reptilian or marine life. This design element is highlighted by the lighting that reflects multiple colors, much like the scales of a fish or reptile.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there glowing, bio-luminescent lines along the edges of the structure that emit an eerie, unnatural light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible glowing lines along the edges of the structure. These lines exhibit a bio-luminescent quality, emitting light that enhances the alien and unnatural appearance of the structure.",
