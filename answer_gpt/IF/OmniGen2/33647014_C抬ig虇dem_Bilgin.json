      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the king piece now depicted as a regally robed water deity with visible fluid or wave-like motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is depicted with a blue hue and flowing robes, which suggest a water motif. This figure is positioned centrally among other transformed pieces, a position often associated with the king in chess. The visual cues, such as the color and fluid design, align with attributes of a water deity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the queen piece now depicted as a regally robed fire deity with visible flame or ember-like motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are figures with orange and red hues, suggestive of fire. The figure to the left of the central water deity exhibits a fiery appearance with flame-like visuals around it, resembling a fire deity. Given its prominent position similar to where a queen might be, it aligns with the description.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the knight pieces now depicted as stone golems with carved armor and rocky textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, to the sides of the central figures, there are entities that resemble armored knights with a stony appearance, indicating that they might be depicted as stone golems. The presence of armor supports the knight imagery with a carved, rocky texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bishop pieces now depicted as ethereal, translucent wind phantoms with swirling or flowing visual effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no figures that directly display the characteristics of ethereal, translucent wind phantoms with swirling visuals. The bishops are not represented as such; hence the answer relies on the lack of such visuals compared to the fiery and watery motifs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pawn pieces now depicted as small, shimmering, and luminous sprites with glowing or reflective qualities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pawn pieces are shown as smaller than the other figures, positioned in the foreground, and appear as glowing or lit figures. They reflect the description of small, luminous aspects associated with sprites.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "question": "Are the rook pieces now depicted as ancient trees with visible runes carved into their trunks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible indication of rooks being depicted as ancient trees with runes. The motifs present focus on elemental deities and other non-tree-related transformations, so this description does not match the visual representation in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all transformed pieces positioned in the same locations as the original chess pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the relative positions of the transformed entities reflect the organization one would expect from a chess setup. The elemental figures align with the positions of king, queen, and knights from Image A, suggesting that the transformed pieces maintain the original positional arrangement.",
