        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window above the sink exhibits a stained glass effect, with clearly segmented sections filled with vibrant colors such as red, blue, yellow, and green.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the stained glass window provides a multitude of colors and segments, the skateboard, kitchen sink, and cabinets do not display vivid geometric designs.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The window in Image B presents intricate patterns and vibrant colors, including curves and various shapes filled with bold hues.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has an overall visually striking appearance mainly due to the stained glass window, which introduces geometric shapes with vibrant colors, drawing attention away from the more subdued skateboard and cabinetry. The geometric emphasis is primarily centered around the window area, contributing to the overall striking design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard, kitchen sink, and cabinets do not stand out due to the stained glass and geometric design effects. These elements maintain a relatively standard appearance and do not incorporate the stained glass effect. It is the window alone that exhibits these design effects, making the window stand out more prominently.",
