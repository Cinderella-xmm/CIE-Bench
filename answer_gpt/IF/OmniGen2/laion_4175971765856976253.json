      "question": "Is there a collectible packaging box visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a clear plastic and cardboard box is depicted, which contains two red characters and various accessories. This setup is consistent with how collectible items are often packaged, presented for display and organization. Therefore, based on the visual cues, there is a collectible packaging box visible in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the packaging box rendered in an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the packaging box in Image B is shown with both the front and side visible to the viewer, which gives a sense of depth and three-dimensionality typical of isometric perspective rendering, providing a more comprehensive view of the packaging. Therefore, using visual cues, the packaging box is rendered in an isometric perspective.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"DUAL TRANSFORMER HEROES\" visible on the packaging box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible text on the packaging box is 'DUAL HERS' and 'DUJAL TRANSFORES,' not the phrase 'DUAL TRANSFORMER HEROES.' The text displayed suggests a stylized title that deviates from the given phrase. Combining knowledge of how product titles should match exactly for identification, the specific phrase 'DUAL TRANSFORMER HEROES' is not present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are chibi-style versions of the car and robot present inside the packaging box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the packaging box shown in Image B, there are two small characters with large heads, simplified features, and exaggerated expressions typically associated with chibi-style figures. However, these figures do not represent versions of the car and robot from Image A. They are generic chibi figures, and there is no indication they represent the specific car and robot mentioned. Since the question specifically asks about chibi versions of those objects, the answer is no.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the chibi figures inside the box rendered in vibrant metallic red and black colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figures inside the box are prominently colored in red and black. The brightness and shine in some of the elements suggest a vibrant and potentially metallic look, aligning with the question's description. Therefore, the figures do appear to be rendered in vibrant metallic red and black colors.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, alongside the chibi figures inside the packaging box, there are additional miniature accessories including tools, alternate helmet pieces, and a gear-like object on clear display within the box. These components seem designed for interaction or customization with the figures, supporting the description of a mini tool set, interchangeable helmets, and a gear base. Therefore, these items are indeed visible inside the packaging box.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any full-sized car or robot figures outside of the packaging. Instead, the scene is focused solely on the packaging box and its contents. Based on this observation, there are no large figures outside the packaging box in the image.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the packaging box and its contents, without any visible figures outside the box. As there are no figures outside the box to assess for realistic textures or lifelike appearance, this question does not apply to the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a clear display of the packaging box with detailed chibi figures and accessories inside, suggesting a presentation-style package. However, the surrounding environment is not indicative of a showcase setup with reflective surfaces or professional lighting. The focus remains on the packaging rather than the environment around it, suggesting the figures are not placed in a pristine showcase environment.",
