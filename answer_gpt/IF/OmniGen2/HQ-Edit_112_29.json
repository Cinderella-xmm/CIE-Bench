      "question": "Is the ship and seascape rendered as a spherical 3D globe rather than a flat scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is depicted within a glass dome, giving it a three-dimensional appearance. The rounded shape of the dome and the way the scene is enclosed suggest that the ship and seascape are part of a spherical 3D globe rather than a flat scene, reinforcing the perception that the entire setup is intended to mimic the look of a miniature world.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the ship encased in a transparent glass dome. This is evidenced by the glass reflections and curvature, which encompass the ship and miniature scene, indicating it is enclosed within a dome rather than an open setting.",

      "is_correct": true

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the glass dome in Image B appears to be made from polished wood, and there are visible intricate details that resemble compass engravings. These designs suggest a nautical theme and provide an ornamental support for the glass dome.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside Image B's globe, there are small figures that appear to represent sea creatures such as starfish. These are floating within the water, enhancing the maritime theme of the miniature globe and giving the impression of a lively underwater scene accompanying the ship.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waves appear more stylized rather than realistically glowing or ethereal. They do not give the effect of being illuminated akin to moonlit waters; they look more like painted or crafted details within the decorative globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sails in Image B appear smooth and crafted, lacking visible fabric texture or intricate folds. This gives them a pristine look, as expected in a miniature model, rather than a realistic fabric depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the domeâ€™s interior features clouds and a stationary ship, there is no indication of dynamic movement, such as moving clouds or glowing waves, which would provide an animated ambiance. The scene inside the dome appears static and crafted.",
