      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies have been edited to include faces and limbs. They have various expressions like smiling, while also featuring arms and legs, giving them anthropomorphic features. The visual cue is the presence of drawn faces with eyes and mouths, and additional appendage-like shapes representing limbs, which is different from the plain cookies seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the image include at least one cookie with a grinning expression, one with a pouting expression, and one with a winking expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows different cookies with distinct facial expressions. One cookie appears to have a wide, grinning expression with open eyes, another displays a sad or pouting expression with a downturned mouth and a differently styled eye expressing sadness, and another one has a winking expression with one eye closed and a small smile. This variety of expressions is achieved through anthropomorphizing the cookies.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B depicts a scene that resembles a tea party. There are several teacups and a teapot with decorated designs around, which are typical props used in a tea party setup.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one of the teacups is depicted with additional details resembling architectural features. It has a small drawn window, giving the impression of a clubhouse.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene has changed from a pink speckled plate to a floral-patterned surface. This surface resembles a picnic blanket due to its elaborate floral design and texture, differing from the plain pink plate shown in Image A. The visual switch denotes a stylistic change, akin to a picnic setting.",
