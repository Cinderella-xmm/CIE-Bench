      "question": "Does the kimono feature stylized, bold outlines and vibrant, flat or gradient colors characteristic of anime illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono is depicted with bold outlines and vibrant colors that are typical of anime illustrations. These elements are used to enhance the stylized depiction characteristic of anime art. The color is uniformly applied without realistic shading, which is common in anime illustrations. This approach contrasts with Image A, where the kimono exhibits more natural, muted colors and textures.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms visibly enlarged beyond natural proportions and rendered in bright, unnatural colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms are shown in a more exaggerated form, with enlarged proportions that are not typical in natural settings. The blossoms are depicted in bright pink shades, which are more vibrant than natural colors, fitting the anime aesthetic. In Image A, the cherry blossoms appear more realistic in size and color, with pale pink hues that resemble actual cherry blossoms.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossom branches depicted with sharp, high-contrast ink-like lines, lacking soft gradients or natural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs sharp, high-contrast lines to outline the cherry blossom branches, reminiscent of ink illustrations found in anime art. These lines lack the soft gradients and textures that are typically found in natural depictions, contrasting with Image A, where the branches have smoother transitions and softer textures that aim for a more realistic representation.",

      "question": "Are there strong, visually striking color contrasts throughout the image, especially between the kimono, flowers, and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B emphasizes strong color contrasts, particularly between elements such as the bright red of the kimono, the vivid pink of the cherry blossoms, and the white background. This contrast is a hallmark of anime and cartoon styles, which often employ bold color combinations to create striking visuals. Image A, by contrast, has more subdued and harmonious color transitions, which are typical of natural imagery.",

      "question": "Is the person’s face, mask, hairstyle, and general pose preserved in the same position and orientation as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite changes in illustration style, Image B maintains the same position and orientation of the person’s face, mask, hairstyle, and general pose as in Image A. This indicates that the editing focused on stylistic changes rather than altering the image's composition or subject positioning.",
