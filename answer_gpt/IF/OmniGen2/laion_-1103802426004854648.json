        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse retains the original plush fabric appearance, characterized by the soft texture visible in the fabric's visual cues. The seahorse's texture does not exhibit the glossy or reflective qualities typically associated with glass material, indicating it remains as plush fabric.",
