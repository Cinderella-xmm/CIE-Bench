      "question": "Is the thermometer depicted in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thermometer is presented with visual elements that suggest a 3D cartoon style. Specifically, the clear outlines, the shading around the edges, and the design of the enclosing box with rounded corners indicate a cartoonish and rendered appearance, which is characteristic of 3D stylization. This style is emphasized by the vibrant color scheme and smooth, rounded forms typically seen in 3D renderings.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image use soft lighting to highlight the thermometer's metallic finish and clearly visible dial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features lighting that appears diffused and soft, creating highlights and shadows which enhance the visual appeal of the metallic finish on the thermometer. This lighting allows the details on the dial to be highly legible while also featuring subtle reflections that mimic a metallic sheen, suggesting a thoughtful use of lighting to highlight these elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] clearly incorporated into the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no indication or text that explicitly mentions stats such as [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C]. The only visible text includes the title and nameplate, which do not contain these specific statistics. Therefore, these elements are not clearly incorporated into the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top portion of the image contains a title banner with text that appears to be 'Presision Thermal Guage,' which seems to be a misspelled version of the phrase 'Precision Thermal Gauge.' Despite the spelling error, the intent of labeling as such is evident.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a section at the bottom of the blue card, which appears to serve as a nameplate. The text on this nameplate reads 'NER MEN+ +LOK.' While not a typical nameplate text, it does serve the purpose of labeling or identifying the item in some capacity.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The border of Image B is sharp and well defined. The card enclosing the thermometer is framed by a clear, crisp border that adds emphasis, providing a finished and polished look to the image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is composed of cool tones such as blue shades, which are often used to convey professionalism and a sense of scientific or technological precision. These tones add a subtlety to the overall theme and appearance of the image, aligning with a more scientific presentation.",
