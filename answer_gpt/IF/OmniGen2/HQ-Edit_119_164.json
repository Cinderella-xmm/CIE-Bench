      "question": "Does the elephant’s skin feature a galaxy-patterned texture with visible stars, nebulae, and cosmic swirls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features an elephant whose skin is depicted with bright, vibrant colors that resemble patterns commonly associated with galaxies. There are visible stars and swirling textures integrated into the skin design, which suggests a cosmic theme. This is determined by recognizing the visible star-like points and swirling nebula-like color formations across the image. These elements visually symbolize cosmic patterns.",

      "question": "Do the elephant’s tusks exhibit a shimmering, nebula-like appearance with glowing, cloud-like textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the tusks in the edited image, they appear to have a luminescent quality with a cloud-like texture that resembles a nebula. The glow and diffuse appearance provide a sense of celestial object overlay on the tusks. This conclusion is based on the consistent nebula theme found across other parts of the image, reinforcing the tusks' appearance as part of this cosmic motif.",

      "question": "Are the elephant’s ears replaced with vast, sail-like structures that reflect starry constellations and have a celestial appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts the elephant's ears in a way that they appear enlarged, reflecting bright and colorful constellations that resemble sails. The ear structures have a vibrant and celestial overlay with star-like details, giving the impression of vast sailing structures. This conclusion stems from the visual cues of colors and patterns resembling a night sky filled with stars.",

      "question": "Does the elephant’s trunk emit a visible, swirling cosmic mist composed of glowing particles or nebula-like vapor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant's trunk in the edited image has a neon glow that suggests nebula-like vapor; however, there is no visible emission of swirling cosmic mist from the trunk itself. While the theme is cosmic, the trunk is rather stable in color and design without additional swirling mist visible.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there radiant, glowing planetary rings encircling the elephant’s legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are bright, glowing rings depicted near the base of the elephant's legs, which resemble planetary rings in luminosity and positioning. The rings consist of vibrant colors that enhance the cosmic theme and provide the visual impression of orbital rings surrounding a planetary body, assisting in forming the answer.",

      "question": "Do the elephant’s feet display luminescent star patterns that glow visibly against the skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The feet of the elephant in the edited image reflect bright, luminescent patterns that resemble star formations. These patterns stand out visibly against the skin, further highlighting the cosmic theme. The distinct glowing points on the feet can be visually interpreted as star-like luminance based on their representation.",
