      "question": "Is the entire elephant and savannah scene enclosed within a visible vintage travel case structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant and the savannah scene are clearly contained within a vintage-style travel case. This is evidenced by the visible handle and the structural edges typical of such a case. The scene appears as a diorama within the enclosure, utilizing the case as its boundary.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the elephant and landscape elements appear as detailed miniature 3D models with realistic scaling and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant and landscape elements are portrayed as 3D miniature models within the travel case. The elephant and the surrounding features have shadows and highlights that suggest a three-dimensional form, providing a sense of depth and scale appropriate for a model rather than life-sized objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ground covered with a material that resembles grass but has a textured, resin-like finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground within the diorama is covered by a material that imitates grass. The surface appears to have a uniform, manufactured texture, suggesting a synthetic or resin-like finish rather than natural grass. This is typical for dioramas where materials are used to mimic natural environments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a small-scale acacia tree placed in the diorama to indicate scale balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small-scale acacia tree included in the diorama next to the elephant model. This tree helps create a sense of scale balance within the scene, as these trees are characteristic of the savannah and help to establish relative size comparisons.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky depicted as painted elements on the inner surface of a backdrop lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are designed within the diorama scene and appear to be painted on the inner surface of the backdrop lid of the case. This is consistent with creating a background scene, where the lid serves as a backdrop, and the clouds give the illusion of a continuous sky.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a brass-colored compass placed on the base of the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a brass-colored compass is visibly placed on the base of the diorama. This compass adds to the thematic elements of exploration and travel, which is in line with the design of a vintage travel case setup.",
