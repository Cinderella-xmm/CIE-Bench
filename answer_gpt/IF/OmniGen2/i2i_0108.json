      "question": "Is the character depicted as a 3D half-body figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted standing fully in front of a television screen, showing the entire body from head to toe. There is no indication that the figure is only half-body, as the legs and feet are visible. The analysis is based on the complete visibility of the character's costume and positioning.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the character appear to be breaking out from a television screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character imposed in front of a television, with the screen displaying an effect that looks like a burst of light. This creates an illusion that the character is emerging from the screen. This effect is created using lighting and positioning, giving an impression of motion from the TV outward.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the character in a defensive shield-raising pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the character is holding a shield with one hand to the side and raised slightly, with the other hand in a fist. Generally, a defensive pose would involve a more pronounced uplift or positioning of the shield in front of the body, potentially covering part of the torso. Here the shield is raised but not directly in front to suggest defense.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image simulate an augmented reality display effect through lighting, shadows, and spatial realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) is designed to simulate augmented reality by placing a 3D figure against a television screen backdrop, with striking lighting and shadow effects that enhance the sense of realism and dimension. The glowing effect on the screen and the precise shadowing contribute to a spatially believable AR effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the character's original appearance and posture been maintained while implementing the new effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, even with the added effects, the character retains a similar appearance and posture as one would typically expect from Captain America, with the costume design intact and no major alterations to the positioning except for the arms showing a slight lifting. The fundamental identity and form is preserved, reflecting a consistent character portrayal within an augmented setting.",
