      "question": "Has snow been added to the clock tower and the surrounding area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower is covered with a noticeable amount of snow on the roof, balcony railing, and various horizontal surfaces. Additionally, the surrounding area has a snowy background, indicating that snow has been added to the scene. Combined with common sense about how snow accumulates during winter, it is clear that snow has been added.",

      "question": "Have the flags been replaced with icy patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flags are blue, resembling icy patterns instead of the green and yellow stripes seen in Image A. Icy patterns typically manifest in a blue hue due to the reflection and refraction of light through ice crystals. Therefore, the flags have been replaced with icy patterns.",

      "question": "Does the overall scene reflect a winter setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the snow covering the clock tower and the snowy background create a visual indication of a winter setting. The cold color palette, snowy environment, and the replacement of the flags with icy patterns all suggest a winter season. Thus, the scene reflects a winter setting.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there visible snow accumulation on the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows snow visibly accumulating on various parts of the clock tower, such as the roof and balcony areas. Snow accumulation typically occurs during winter or cold conditions, visibly changing the appearance of structures. Hence, there is visible snow accumulation on the clock tower.",

    {

      "question": "Do the flags display distinct icy patterns that differ from the original green and yellow stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image comparison reveals that the flags in Image B have been changed to blue with an icy visual appearance, contrasting with the original green and yellow striped flags in Image A. Blue icy patterns are distinct and different from stripes, providing an altered visual aesthetic. Therefore, the flags indeed display distinct icy patterns different from the original.",
