      "question": "Has the formal suit been replaced with a vibrant, floral-patterned design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit features a dynamic, floral pattern with bright colors, contrasting significantly with the traditional dark suit visible in Image A. The stark difference in design, color, and visual impact, suggests a complete replacement of the original formal suit with a vibrant, floral-patterned one. This assessment is based on the unmistakable visual cues presented in the edited image.",

      "question": "Has the bow tie been replaced with a bold, colorful design featuring geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bow tie in a solid blue color, which complements the lively geometric tie design. Comparing this to the muted checked pattern of the bow tie in Image A, it is clear that a replacement has occurred in terms of design and color scheme. The edited bow tie features a simplified and colorful appearance that matches the pop art characteristics of the overall image.",

      "question": "Does the background feature a distinct dotted texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is covered with small white dots against an orange backdrop, which creates a textured effect distinct from the plain, dark background in Image A. This pronounced dotted patterning is a clear visual cue indicating the presence of a textured background in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is characterized by vibrant colors, bold floral patterns, and geometric designs, all of which are hallmarks of the pop art style. The contrast of bright colors, absence of shading, and stylized design reinforce pop art aesthetics, differing significantly from the subdued palette of Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to Image B's blurred region limiting visual access to facial features, any changes in facial attributes are indeterminable. However, the posture appears consistent with Image A's presentation, suggesting no alteration has occurred in this regard. The known cues do not indicate a change in posture.",
