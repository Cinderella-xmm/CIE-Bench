      "question": "Is the edited image presented as a flat postcard format rather than a 3D product shot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I observe that the bag is displayed with a clear, three-dimensional view with visible shadows and highlights that provide depth, indicating a 3D product shot rather than a flat postcard format. The bag's features, such as the handles and strap, show dimensionality and are not compressed into a flat perspective. Furthermore, the presence of a black portfolio and an ivory page in the background does not transform the bag into a flat postcard format. Therefore, the image maintains its three-dimensional product presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the main features of the bag rendered in minimalist line art style with clean, simplified outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the bag in a detailed and photorealistic style rather than in a minimalist line art style. The textures, such as the chevron pattern and the gold zippers, are clearly visible and intricate, which is contrary to the flat and simple appearance of line art. The image suggests a realistic representation focusing on the material and intricate design rather than minimalism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the chevron pattern visually enhanced to appear raised or embossed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chevron pattern on the bag appears to have depth due to shadows and highlights that create an embossed look. Such visual cues suggest that the pattern is raised or has a texture, offering a three-dimensional effect on its surface. This contrasts with a flat depiction, where such a pattern would not exhibit any depth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gold zippers depicted with a raised or embossed effect, distinct from the surrounding surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold zippers show visible highlights and shadows, giving them a raised or embossed appearance. These visual cues help the zippers stand out as separate from the bag's surface, suggesting they have a three-dimensional form that differentiates them from being simply flat to the bag.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire image rendered in a muted olive tone palette without vibrant or contrasting colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the main color of the bag is olive, the image is not restricted to muted colors. There are vibrant elements present, such as the gold-colored zippers and hardware, which contrast with the olive tones. This combination of muted and vibrant colors does not fit an entirely muted palette definition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image include a blank area on the back of the postcard suitable for writing messages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evidence of a blank area designated for writing messages. The background shows a black portfolio and an ivory-colored page but does not serve the typical layout of a postcard with a blank area for text. Instead, the focus remains on the bag as a three-dimensional object.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {

      "question": "Is the postcard displayed inside a sleek black portfolio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, behind the bag, there appears to be a black rectangular object resembling a portfolio or sleeve. This object contains an ivory-colored page, suggesting that the black item functions as a portfolio. Thus, the bag is displayed in front of what seems like a sleek black portfolio.",

      "question": "Are the interior pages of the portfolio ivory in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a portion of an interior page of the portfolio peeks from behind the bag, contrasting against the black portfolio with its ivory color. This implies that the visible interior pages are indeed ivory, offering an elegant contrast to both the black portfolio and the olive color of the bag.",
