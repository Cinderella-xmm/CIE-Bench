      "question": "Are the walls of the cabin visibly transformed into bark-covered limbs with naturalistic textures and irregular shapes resembling tree trunks or branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a log cabin with distinct wall textures that mimic the appearance of tree trunks or branches. The individual logs are visibly rounded and placed horizontally, resembling the natural formation and texture of bark-covered limbs. This design contrasts with the more uniform log construction found in Image A where the logs have a smoother finish.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin windows have been transformed into circular, amber-emitting features that appear similar to eyes. This replaces the standard rectangular window openings seen in Image A, adding an element that resembles glowing eye sockets.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cabin roof designed to resemble a natural canopy made of dense, vibrant green leaves. This appearance significantly diverges from Image A's more conventional roofing materials, which appeared to be shingles.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of greenery such as vines and moss is evident as they cover aspects of the cabin, including the roofline and the spaces between logs. In contrast, Image A does not show any vegetation growing on the cabin surfaces.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "explanation": "While Image B presents a fantastical scene, the notion of garage doors being replaced with animated faces emitting energy trails is not visible. Instead, no structure resembling forest spirit faces or energy trails is depicted, as the cabin lacks garage doors entirely.",
