      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image composed of three distinct panels arranged side by side or in a triptych layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three separate sections placed next to each other, forming a triptych layout. This conclusion is drawn from observing the vertical divisions and distinct visual themes in each section which are characteristic of a triptych format.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the central panel show a cartoon-style depiction of the womanâ€™s hands turning the pages of the book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central panel in Image B illustrates a cartoonish image of the woman holding a book. The depiction simplifies and stylizes the features into a cartoon representation, as evidenced by the simplistic lines and exaggerated proportions typical of cartoon art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the left panel display a morphed version of her hand that transitions into a tree branch structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the left panel of Image B, there is a hand visually connected to a tree, forming a structure that appears to be transitioning or morphing into a tree branch. This analysis is based on the observation of the hand's positioning and its integration with the tree form, which conveys a fusion of human and natural elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the right panel show floral elements such as flowers or vines decorating or brightening the bench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right panel in Image B indeed features flowers, leaves, and natural motifs surrounding a bench, adding visual interest and decoration. The presence of these botanical elements enhances the appearance of the bench, aligning with the description of floral decoration.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the panels rendered on soft pastel-colored paper with visible leaf-patterned textures along their edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of the panels in Image B have soft, pastel colors and subtle decorative patterns that suggest a leaf-like texture. This conclusion is reached by examining the gentle hues and patterns that contribute to a textured appearance, reminiscent of pastel illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the elderly woman still recognizable in at least the central panel, with her facial features, glasses, and book clearly present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the central panel of Image B, although a cartoon version depicts an elderly figure holding a book, the specific facial features and accessories such as glasses are not distinctly represented due to the stylization. The depiction focuses more on representing a general character type rather than preserving detailed individual traits.",
