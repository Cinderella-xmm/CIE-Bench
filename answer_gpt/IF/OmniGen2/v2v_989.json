      "question": "Is the black dog depicted in a chibi-style with exaggerated, cute features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black dog maintains a realistic appearance without exaggerated features commonly seen in the chibi style, such as oversized eyes or a disproportionately large head. It retains a naturalistic form, similar to how dogs generally appear in real life. Chibi style is characterized by such cute, exaggerated proportions, which are not present here.",

      "question": "Are the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag rendered in a minimalist flat design without gradients or 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag are depicted with solid colors and clean lines, lacking shading, gradients, or any three-dimensional effects. This style exemplifies minimalist flat design, which focuses on simplicity and uses two-dimensional representation without depth perception.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black dog the most prominent element in the illustration, with its distinct characteristics preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the dog is positioned centrally at the bottom and is large, making it a focal point in the composition. Its characteristics, such as its posture and features, are preserved, maintaining its identity as a realistic representation of a dog rather than being overshadowed by other elements. The simple style of the other elements ensures the dog stands out.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the illustration incorporate a bold white outline around its perimeter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is circumscribed by a definitive bold white outline, forming a clear boundary around the circular frame of the illustration. This framing style is typical in graphic designs to distinguish the main content from its background or surroundings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dog and bench extend slightly beyond the circular frame of the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the dog and the bench fit entirely within the boundaries of the circular frame. They are contained within this bold white outline, suggesting no elements extend beyond this circular perimeter.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background of the illustration transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background within the circular frame of Image B shows a greenish background reminiscent of a grass field, indicating it is not transparent. There is a solid fill behind the objects, which contrasts with the white outline but does not suggest transparency.",
