      "question": "Is the bird on the left depicted as an animated origami figure with visible star chart patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird on the left has visual characteristics of origami, such as folded paper-like facets and edges that indicate it's made to look like origami art, but it does not have visible star chart patterns. The design appears stylized and geometric, simulating origami rather than incorporating astrological or celestial chart patterns.",

      "question": "Does the bird on the right appear as a luminous crystalline structure with sharp edges and a glowing effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird on the right in Image B is rendered with features consistent with a crystalline structure, exhibiting sharp edges and a transparency effect. It also possesses a glowing effect, which is highlighted by the bluish hue and the illumination pattern across its surface that simulates light reflecting on crystal-like surfaces.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both birds perched on colossal, intricately carved ivory chess rooks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both birds are perched on chess pieces that resemble rooks. These chess pieces appear oversized relative to the birds and have a simple, smooth design rather than being intricately carved. The material resembles ivory or an ivory-like substance, given its cream color and sheen.",

      "question": "Is the background a surreal library with bookshelves and books drifting through aisles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a library background with bookshelves filled with books. However, there is no indication of books drifting through aisles; the books appear stationary on the shelves. The library setting is consistent and realistic in depiction without any elements that suggest surrealism involving floating books.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the positions and postures of the birds have been altered. In Image B, the birds are designed in different artistic styles (origami and crystalline), affecting their posture and visual orientation. Furthermore, their stakes on chess pieces represent a significant change in position from the rocks in Image A.",
