        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the words 'Clean First' are prominently displayed against a red background in the top left corner of the image.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text in the bottom right corner reads 'ALWAYS'. The slogan 'Comfort Always' indirectly referenced as 'Comfort.' appears separately at the top right.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Though the word 'ALWAYS' appears in the bottom right, it does not include 'Comfort'; hence, the exact phrase 'Comfort Always' is not present. Image B strategically separates words which could represent a slogan indirectly. This evaluation is based on the typography and typical placement strategies used in design.",
