      "question": "Is the butterfly depicted as a voxel-based 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a butterfly with smooth, detailed textures, and a realistic appearance rather than the blocky, pixelated style typical of voxel models. Voxel models are made up of small cubic units, which is not evident in the butterfly in Image B. The butterfly here has organic curves and blended colors, which indicates it is not voxel-based.",

      "question": "Does the butterfly's design and style resemble the icons shown in the left image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a butterfly with a very refined and realistic design, showcasing detailed textures and shading. In comparison, the butterfly in Image A appears similar yet less polished, with more natural imperfections and realistic texture indicative of a photograph. Image B does not contain icons, but the design is more aligned with digitally enhanced graphics than the real butterfly in Image A.",

      "question": "Was the butterfly rendered in Octane at 8k resolution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Rendering techniques like Octane often produce highly detailed and realistic images. Image B displays a butterfly with convincing lighting, well-defined textures, and vivid colors that are consistent with high-resolution rendering. However, the specific resolution cannot be determined from visual cues alone. Understanding the typical type of render suggests it could be created using rendering technologies like Octane.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the butterfly exhibit three-dimensional characteristics such as depth and perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the butterfly with depth and perspective, evidenced by the natural shadows and highlights on its body and wings, as well as the positioning of the butterfly on the wooden surface. The rendering gives it a three-dimensional aspect as opposed to a flat representation, using shading and texture to imply volume and space.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the butterfly display realistic lighting and shading effects indicative of being rendered in Octane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B showcases detailed textures, accurate shadows, and highlights, which suggest realistic lighting and shading effects. These qualities are consistent with advanced rendering tools like Octane, which focus on achieving real-world lighting conditions in digital models. The depth and coloration further support the idea of high-quality rendering.",
