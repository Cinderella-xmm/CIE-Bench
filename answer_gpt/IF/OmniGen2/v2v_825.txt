    "Question": "Q1: Are the calendar pages arranged into a tidy pile?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar pages are scattered unevenly over the surface. They overlap and are angled differently, not stacked in a neat or tidy arrangement. The lack of alignment or stacking of the pages suggests a disorganized or random placement rather than a neat pile.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the handwritten notes and highlighted dates still present and unchanged?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the prominent handwritten notes like 'Birthday', 'No Work', 'Wedding', and 'Gym' are visible, and the highlighted dates with colored circles are still present. However, upon closer inspection, the note 'Quite day' in April has a typographical error, becoming 'Quct day', suggesting some change.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the calendar pages and desk surface display convincing textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar pages have a defined edge and some shadowing that suggest a paper-like texture.

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there evidence of lighting and shadow depth creating a realistic appearance?",

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the colors and styles of the handwritten notes and highlighted dates been preserved?",
