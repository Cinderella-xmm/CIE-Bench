      "question": "Does the edited image show the building transformed into a giant mechanical golem with visible articulated limbs and exposed gears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable addition of a large mechanical appendage extending from the building's side, resembling an arm with visible mechanical parts and gears. This strongly suggests the transformation of the building into a giant mechanical entity like a golem. Using world knowledge, a golem traditionally refers to an animated anthropomorphic being, often with visible mechanical features when depicted as a machine.",

      "question": "Are all original windows replaced with glowing energy panels that emit light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual cues in Image B, the windows on the building remain in place without emitting light as energy panels would. The appearance of the windows is consistent with a standard architectural design rather than being replaced with glowing energy panels. Hence, the edited image does not reflect such a transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the balconies been transformed into arm-like mechanical appendages extending from the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building retains its original balconies without transformation into mechanical appendages. The mostly rectangular shapes of the balconies do not resemble arm-like structures. Only one prominent mechanical arm is visible, which seems to be an appended addition rather than a transformation of the balconies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible intricate circuit patterns covering the surface of the building, resembling electronic wiring or circuits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows intricate patterns resembling electronic circuit designs on the building's facade. These patterns depict circuit-like designs as if the building is part of an electronic system. This suggests an artificial, technological theme applied to the building’s surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the building's angular edges appear as dynamic or movable mechanical components, such as hinges, pistons, or rotating joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not portray the building's angular edges as movable mechanical components. The building's architecture remains consistent with a static structure, without resembling movable mechanical parts like hinges or pistons.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background remains a clear blue sky, just like in Image A. There are no visible modifications or additions to the background, maintaining the same serene atmosphere.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The building's size and position within the frame have remained consistent between Image A and Image B. Despite the edited visual elements, the building occupies the same relative space in the frame, maintaining its original proportions and alignment.",
