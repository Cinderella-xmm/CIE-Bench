      "question": "Is the chocolate tower redesigned into a box-shaped structure resembling a festive tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the structure maintains a conical, tree-like shape with stacked layers, resembling a festive Christmas tree rather than a box shape. The conical configuration is suggestive of a tree due to the tapered silhouette.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chocolate layers are fully exposed and visible, but there are no cutout windows or concealed areas. Each layer is part of the open design of the chocolate tree pyramid, without the need of windows to reveal the contents.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are elements with a golden appearance, particularly the spherical decorations and the central focal points in some layers and the top element. These reflect gold-like qualities, suggesting the use of gold foiling on these parts.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of Image B features glossy and reflective gold elements that give a shiny appearance but doesn't imply a sparkle effect across the entire surface. It seems more metallic and smooth rather than sparkly.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has text at the base; however, it doesn't appear to feature any recognizable brand signature, unlike Image A, which explicitly mentions 'La Maison du Chocolat Paris.' Image B's text reads 'ChocoConifer Delights,' which is more of a name than a brand signature.",
