      "question": "Are the surfers replaced with pandas holding surfboards?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two figures standing on the beach holding surfboards are visually depicted as giant pandas. This can be identified by the distinctive black and white coloration of their faces and bodies, resembling the characteristics of a panda bear. Consequently, the human figures seen in Image A appear to be replaced by pandas in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the sunset and beach setting kept intact without any changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a beach setting with the sun at the horizon during what appears to be sunset, casting an orange glow on the ocean and sand. This setting matches the sunset and beach ambiance in Image A. Therefore, the sunset and beach environment appears unchanged between the images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the pandas positioned similarly to the original surfers, facing the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pandas are standing side by side on the beach looking towards the horizon, with the sun positioned in front of them. This positioning is analogous to the human figures in Image A, who are also standing in the same aligned posture while facing the sunset. Thus, the pandas maintain the same orientation as the original surfers.",

      "question": "Are the pandas holding surfboards in their paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pandas are each holding a surfboard with one limb, which appears similar to how the human figures in Image A are holding the surfboards. The adjustment ensures that the surfboards are maintained as original props, indicating that the pandas are indeed holding the surfboards.",

      "question": "Do the surfboards retain their original colors and design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the surfboards exhibit the same color patterns and designs: the left surfboard is yellow, and the right surfboard features a red, teal, and orange design. Since the surfboards appear unchanged in terms of color and pattern between the images, they retain their original look.",
