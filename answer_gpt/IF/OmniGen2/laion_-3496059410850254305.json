      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar body retains its traditional form without any elements resembling armor or an armored torso.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The guitar body in Image B appears to have a wooden texture, similar to that of a mahogany finish, but it does not possess metallic qualities or visible reflective properties.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features dynamic elements around the character, such as bright outlines and flowing aspects around the cape, suggesting movement and energy. These lines create a visual impression of motion or dynamism surrounding the character. Such illustrative elements are commonly used to depict channeled energy.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The guitar strings in Image B retain their normal appearance and remain as thin, parallel lines typical for guitar strings. There is no indication that they have been transformed into thick, muscle-like strands. The strings are consistent with the original design of the guitar without alteration into different forms.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a luminous cape emanating from the character, which is stylized to suggest motion and potentially sound wave motifs around the edges. The guitar headstock features a bright region, which might be interpreted as an emblem. The integration of these elements can suggest a thematic combination of motion and sound.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the addition of dynamic elements in Image B, the overall silhouette and structure of the guitar remain discernible - the headstock, neck, and body are still identifiable features of the guitar, maintaining their traditional structure. Visually, the guitar retains its recognizable form.",
