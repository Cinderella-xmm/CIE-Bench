      "question": "Have the three sheep been converted into chibi characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three chibi characters dressed in winter apparel, resembling cartoonified versions of a goat and two sheep, which match the general concept of the original figures in Image A. Chibi characters are typically characterized by their cute, simplified, and exaggerated features, consistent with the characters shown. Given this depiction, it can be concluded that the original animals have been transformed into chibi-style illustrations.",

      "question": "Do the chibi characters have scarves, earmuffs, and gloves added as winter accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi characters in Image B each wear winter accessories: scarves, earmuffs (or equivalent hat features), and gloves. These accessories align with typical winter clothing items that help prevent cold, thereby enhancing the cuteness and seasonal theme of the characters.",

      "question": "Has the interaction pose of the chibi characters by the railing been maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the animals are positioned interacting with a fence, suggesting association with their environment. In Image B, however, the chibi characters stand side by side without any interaction with a railing, indicating that the pose and interaction context have not been preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the chibi characters in a clear, flat, cartoon-like style, which is notable for its thick outlines defining the shapes of the characters. This style is a standard representation in chibi art, contributing to the simplistic and endearing aesthetic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is a white-filled area with no complex background elements present, suggesting an intent for the image itself to serve standalone. However, there is no indication of transparency (usually denoted by a checkered pattern in design tools), implying the image is not prepared as a transparent sticker.",
