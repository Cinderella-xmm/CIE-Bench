      "question": "Are all makeup brushes replaced with sculpted crystal wands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows elongated objects resembling crystal wands, with each one having a different colored tip that resembles gemstones. This indicates that the brushes have been replaced with sculpted crystal wands featuring colorful tips. The visual details combined with world knowledge lead to the conclusion that these crystal wands differ significantly from traditional makeup brushes in appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each wand features a distinctly colored structure at the end, resembling the common characteristics of gemstones. The varied colors and shapes suggest unique gemstones for each wand. Based on visual information combined with general knowledge of gemstones, it is reasonable to conclude that each wand is topped with a uniquely designed gemstone.",

      "question": "Is the container a transparent crystal vase with visible etched floral patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the container as a transparent structure, featuring patterns in its design that evoke a sense of etched floral details, characteristic of crystal craftsmanship. Based on the visual cues and understanding of etched glassware designs, it is logical to identify the container as a transparent crystal vase with etched patterns.",

      "question": "Has the lace band been replaced with a carved crystal ribbon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a lace band surrounding the container, consistent in appearance with decorative lace rather than a carved crystal ribbon. Visual recognition of textures indicates that the band remains lace, as a change to carved crystal would be manifestly different in material and design. Hence, no change is observed in the material from lace to crystal ribbon.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of Image B appears to have reflective properties, showing reflections of the vase and wands which is indicative of a mirrored surface. The visual reflection combined with knowledge on how mirrored surfaces function leads to the conclusion that the arrangement is on such a surface.",
