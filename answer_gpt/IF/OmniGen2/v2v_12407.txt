    "Question": "Q1: Is the mango depicted with visible pixelation characteristic of 8-bit graphics?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mango appears with clear pixelation, featuring distinct square pixels that indicate a low resolution typical of 8-bit graphics. These characteristics are consistent with the blocky, clearly defined pixels that are typical of early digital art forms, such as those seen in old video games.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the table and napkin rendered with a simplified, low-resolution appearance consistent with 8-bit graphics?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the table and napkin are depicted with pixelated edges and blocky shapes. This simplification is consistent with 8-bit graphics, where objects are rendered using large, visible pixels and lack detailed textures, focusing instead on strong outlines and simplified forms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the image utilize a limited color palette typical of 8-bit graphics?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are limited and highly contrasting, typical of 8-bit graphics where a restricted color palette is used to reduce complexity and processing power requirements. The table, mango, and other elements feature solid, bright colors without gradients, which is a hallmark of 8-bit style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are shadows and highlights on the mango and table simplified to match the flat shading typical of 8-bit graphics?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, shadows and highlights are represented by flat areas of color rather than smooth gradients, which aligns with the flat shading characteristic of 8-bit graphics. This technique reduces detail and creates a more stylized appearance focusing on distinct color blocks rather than realistic shading.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the overall composition of the image simplified, focusing on basic shapes and forms rather than detailed textures?",
    "explanation": "Image B focuses on elementary shapes and forms, where each component is made up of clearly defined blocks of color and lacks intricate details. This simplified composition is typical of 8-bit graphics, aiming to convey the intended scene with minimal visual complexity while maintaining recognizable shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
