    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire lighthouse scene enclosed within a spherical glass or transparent globe?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighthouse and its surrounding scene are distinctly encapsulated within a transparent, spherical structure resembling a globe. This enclosure is visually emphasized by the reflective surface and distortion traditionally seen in glass globes. The edges of the globe are clearly marked, further confirming its presence as a spherical, glass-like enclosure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the lighthouse inside the globe depicted as a miniature 3D model rather than a full-scale structure?",
    "explanation": "The lighthouse within Image B appears as a smaller, contained model relative to the size of the globe. The scale of the lighthouse compared to the globe suggests it is a miniature, as a full-scale lighthouse would not fit within such a small enclosure. The stylized and compact arrangement corroborates the notion of it being a 3D model.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the waves around the lighthouse inside the globe made of translucent blue resin with a stylized appearance?",
    "explanation": "The waves within the globe in Image B are depicted with a smooth, stylized aesthetic that lacks realistic texture, indicative of resin craftsmanship. Their vibrant blue color and semi-translucent quality further imply they are constructed from a material like resin, rather than natural water. This creative representation aligns with the typical design of resin models.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the globe rest on a wooden base with an engraved compass rose pattern?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the globe is mounted on a base that appears to be made of wood. On this base, a compass rose pattern is visibly engraved, adding to the decorative and functional style of the stand. Such design elements are commonly featured on globes to suggest navigation and exploration themes, complementing the lighthouse motif.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are painted clouds and a distant mountain panorama visible in the background behind the globe?",
    "explanation": "In the background of Image B, softly blurred painted clouds and a distant mountain range are visible, encircling the majority of the image behind the globe. These features suggest a backdrop commonly used in scenic artworks or dioramas to create depth and context, extending beyond the confines of the globe itself and contributing to the overall composition of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the rocks inside the globe rendered in earthy tones (such as browns, tans, and greens) and the water in vibrant shades of blue?",
    "explanation": "Inside the globe in Image B, the rocks are depicted with earthy tones including browns and tans, complemented by subtle hints of green which suggest grass or vegetation. These natural hues contrast with the dynamic shades of blue used for the water, highlighting the artistic rendition. This color scheme aligns with common representations of natural landscapes and is consistent with stylized miniature models.",
    "answer": "Yes"
