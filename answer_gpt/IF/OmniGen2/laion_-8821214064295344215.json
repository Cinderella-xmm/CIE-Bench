      "question": "Are the teddy bears rendered as mosaic figurines made of small colorful tiles mimicking fur texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bears are shown with a texture that resembles a mosaic or tile pattern. The 'fur' of the bears is depicted with what looks like small, colorful, and evenly placed squares that resemble tiles. This mosaic-like pattern gives the visual impression of fur texture, created using a tile motif. The use of colored tiles suggests an artistic rendering typical of mosaic works.",

      "question": "Have the knitted sweaters been replaced with intricate tile patterns in yellow and turquoise hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the previous knitted texture from Image A has been replaced by an intricate pattern of tiles. These tiles form the 'sweater' areas of the bears, using a consistent and closely packed tile pattern in yellow and turquoise colors, matching the original hues of their knitted counterparts. This creates a visual transformation from a soft, fabric-based aesthetic to a hard, tiled one.",

      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, snout) recreated using subtly shaded tiles to provide detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes, nose, mouth, and snout of the teddy bears are crafted using small, subtly shaded tiles. These tiles vary slightly in shade from the main colors surrounding them, adding depth and definition to the facial features and allowing for finer details that mimic the original expressions and shapes present in Image A.",

      "question": "Do the bows appear in glossy, smooth tiles that contrast with the mosaic texture of the rest of the bears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the bows are constructed with tiles that have a glossy, reflective surface. This glossy appearance creates a visual contrast against the more matte, mosaic-like texture of the rest of the bears. The smooth, shiny nature of the tiles used for the bows enhances their distinctiveness and sets them apart from the rest of the bears' tile patterns.",

      "question": "Are the mosaic bears positioned on a minimalistic white pedestal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bears are positioned on a white, flat surface that resembles a pedestal, likely used to display artworks. This minimalistic setting highlights the bears as art objects and serves to draw attention to their mosaic detail without any visual distractions from the background.",
