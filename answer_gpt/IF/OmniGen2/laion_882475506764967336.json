      "question": "Are the table and chairs visibly constructed from LEGO bricks with interlocking patterns and stud details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table and chairs exhibit characteristics that are typical of LEGO constructions, such as interlocking LEGO brick patterns and visible stud details on the surface of the table and the seats of the chairs. The use of standard LEGO shapes and textures, such as the rounded studs, is prominent. This observation suggests the furniture is made entirely of LEGO bricks.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the tabletop and chair seats feature interlocking LEGO brick patterns consistent with modular construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tabletop and chair seats in Image B are clearly constructed using LEGO bricks that fit together in the interlocking pattern characteristic of LEGO sets. This modular assembly allows the different parts to connect and form a coherent and stable structure, a key feature of LEGO design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable LEGO plant element positioned at the center of the table, resembling a small potted plant with a trunk and leaves, a feature often depicted in LEGO sets to mimic real plants.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface beneath the furniture in Image B resembles a flat, gray LEGO baseplate, indicated by the repeating stud pattern typical of a LEGO baseplate. This is different from the concrete patio seen in Image A, showcasing a change consistent with the overall LEGO theme of the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does retain some elements like the wooden fence, but it is simplified and stylized in a way that is consistent with LEGO set designs. While some elements might appear reduced in complexity, they are depicted in a way typical of LEGO environments.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The furniture in Image B uses a combination of brown and an amber shade for the LEGO bricks, which gives a visual impression similar to wood. This color scheme resonates with the wood theme of the original image but replicated using LEGO bricks.",
