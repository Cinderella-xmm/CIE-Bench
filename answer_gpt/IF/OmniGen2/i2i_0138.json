      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both 'Sharp' and 'Clean' appear in solid and clear fonts rather than a rough sketch style.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, after examining the added elements, features bold typography with clean lines around the scissors that suits a professional look.
