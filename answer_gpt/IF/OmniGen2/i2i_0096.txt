    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image show a left-side 90-degree view of the sofa alongside the front view?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, it shows the front view of a dark, plush, modern sofa positioned beneath a large abstract painting. There is no visible 90-degree side view of the sofa presented in this image. The view is strictly from a front-on perspective, and no side perspective is included which would show the depth of the sofa. Given this information, and leveraging basic understanding of viewing angles, we conclude there is no side view present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the dimensions of the sofa consistent between the front and left-side views?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a singular frontal view of the sofa. Since there's no side view provided, the question of consistency between front and side views in relation to dimensionality does not arise. Thus, it is not possible to assess the dimensions across different views when only one view is available.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the transition between the front and side views of the sofa smooth and coherent?",
    "explanation": "Considering Image B only displays a frontal perspective and lacks any visible transition to a side view, there is no evidence of a transition requiring evaluation. A seamless transition implies the presence of both a front and a side view that smoothly converge, which is absent here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the lighting and shadows on the sofa consistent in both the front and side views?",
    "explanation": "Given that Image B exhibits only a front-facing perspective of the sofa, there is no side view to analyze or compare. Consequently, the uniformity of lighting and shadows across different angles cannot be assessed. The lighting visible on the front view appears natural, with shadows present due to the apparent light source direction.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do objects around the sofa (e.g., wall art) appear correctly scaled and positioned relative to the combined view?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wall art above the sofa is centrally aligned and looks proportionate to the size of the sofa. The art scaling appears intentional and suitable for the room's layout. Given there's no additional side view, the observed setup with the single visible perspective holds correct scaling and positioning relative to itself.",
    "answer": "Yes"
