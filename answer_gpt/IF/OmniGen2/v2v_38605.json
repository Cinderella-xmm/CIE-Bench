        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a shift from a snowy mountain scene to a tropical beach environment.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual appears to be skiing on the beach waves, which mimics a surfing style, indicated by the presence of a snowboard-like equipment and ocean waves, despite retaining skiing gear. When compared with Image A, where the person is distinctly skiing on snow, it shows the intention to transform the skier into someone who seems to be surfing the beach waves.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases bright, vibrant colors typical of a tropical setting, such as the bright blue of the ocean and the vivid greenery of the palm trees. These features contrast with the cooler, muted colors of the snowy mountain scene in Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waves in Image B are depicted lively and bright blue, reminiscent of ideal surfing conditions. Although the scene shows skiing equipment, the wave coloration and form suggest vibrancy typical of surfing waves, which contrasts with the snow environment of Image A.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual's posture, including the bent knees and forward lean, remains consistent with the skiing form observed in Image A, despite being placed in a surfing-like beach environment. This indicates that while the environment has changed, the posture typical of skiing has been retained.",
