      "question": "Does the teddy bear have a faceted low-poly appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear shows a distinct angular appearance with noticeable flat surfaces and sharp edges, indicative of a low-poly art style. This style is characterized by geometric facets rather than smooth and detailed surfaces. This analysis is confirmed through visual observation of the teddy bear, and this style choice aligns with modern digital art trends where objects and characters are rendered with low polygon counts for effect.",

      "question": "Does the motorcycle have a faceted low-poly appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the motorcycle with a smooth and intricate design with polished reflections, not consistent with a low-poly appearance. Unlike the teddy bear, the motorcycle is rendered precisely with high detail and does not possess the angular facets associated with a low-poly style.",

      "question": "Is the scenic background rendered in a low-poly style while still being recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B remains realistic and clear, showing no signs of low-poly rendering. Landforms and details are smooth without angular or polygonal facets. It retains a photographic quality indicative of high-resolution images rather than the simplified and geometric nature of low-poly designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the two images, the pose and position of the teddy bear remain the same in terms of its relation to the motorcycle and how it is seated. Despite the change to a low-poly appearance, the teddy bear's posture and orientation have been preserved.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the motorcycle retains the same position and orientation. Its design in terms of shape, dimensions, and positioning remains unchanged despite the slight variations in style execution between the two images.",
