      "question": "Do the dolls have bold calligraphic outlines around them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls are depicted with bold calligraphic outlines, which is highlighted by clear, defined edges that are characteristic of an illustration rather than a photograph. This artistic technique gives the objects a distinct and cartoonish appearance, contrasting with the typical softer and less distinct edges found in photographs.",

      "question": "Are the dolls' clothing and hair depicted using flat planes of color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls' clothing and hair are illustrated using flat planes of color, a common technique in digital illustrations or cartoons where shading and texture are minimal, leading to a uniform look. This style contrasts with the detailed and textured appearance in Image A, where lighting and shadows provide a more realistic depth.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the store environment been replaced with a subtly patterned, simplified background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been changed to a simple and plain design with subtle color variations, typical of an illustration style, contrasting the detailed, realistic, and busy look of the store environment in Image A. This replacement creates a cleaner and less cluttered visual context.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image B and Image A, the foreground doll is posed in a ballet stance with arms spread out, wearing a tutu. Despite the stylistic differences, both images depict a similar pose and costume, maintaining the original context. The tutu in Image B, while illustrated, retains a light color similar to that in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seated doll is illustrated on the right side, wearing a pink top and appearing to be on a mat of a similar color to fuchsia, though simplified in style. This setup is consistent with Image A, where the color combination and position also align with this description, despite the difference in visual style from a photograph to an illustration.",
