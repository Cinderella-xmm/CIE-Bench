      "question": "Is the motorcycle composed entirely of black and blue LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is clearly built using LEGO-style bricks, and the primary colors seen in the construction are black and blue. This is apparent from the distinct modular brick style and the color distribution typical of LEGO. Thus, based on visual cues and the distinct LEGO brick style, the motorcycle is indeed composed entirely of black and blue LEGO-style bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the LEGO model retain the angular design features of the original motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO model in Image B maintains angular features typical of LEGO constructions, with sharp edges and distinct geometric shapes designed to mimic the original motorcycle's angular design. Comparing this with common LEGO design principles, where the aim is often to capture the essence of the original design, the LEGO model successfully preserves the angular design features.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wheel rims replaced with intricate cog patterns typical of LEGO mechanical parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheel rims of the LEGO model reflect a patterned design that resembles intricate cog patterns. This is characteristic of LEGO mechanical parts, which often include such features to emulate real-world mechanical components. These visual details are indicative of LEGO's style for mechanical parts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original decals represented as colorful printed tiles on the LEGO model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model does not show any signs of colorful printed tiles representing decals, which differentiates it from the original motorcycle's decals seen in Image A, where various colorful decals and stickers are prominently displayed. LEGO models typically depict such details through flat tiles with printed designs, but this is not observed here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO model placed on a smooth gray baseplate with directional arrows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model rests on a smooth gray baseplate, and while there is printed text and the MR logo, directional arrows are not visible. LEGO models often feature such baseplates, enhancing display aesthetics, and providing stability, but directional arrows are not present here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the blue and black stripes follow the same dynamic flow and positioning as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue and black stripes on the LEGO model in Image B follow a similar dynamic flow and positioning as in Image A, albeit in a more simplified and blocky manner, characteristic of LEGO representations. This indicates an attempt to capture the original design pattern within the constraints of LEGO brick styling, maintaining the essence of the stripes' flow and position.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the LEGO model displayed within a clean, enclosed display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO model situated within an environment that appears to be a clean, enclosed display case. This is inferred from the uniform lighting and the enclosed glass-like structure surrounding the model, a typical presentation style for valuable or collectible items, aligning with common practices for displaying LEGO models.",
