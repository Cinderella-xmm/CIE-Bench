      "question": "Is the teapot now a cylindrical container instead of its original rounded shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object displayed is not a teapot but a cylindrical container, indicative of a jar or packaging tin. Its shape is distinctly cylindrical with a uniform diameter and flat top and bottom, in contrast to typical teapot shapes which are more rounded with spouts and handles. The analysis concludes on this basis that the teapot has been replaced or redesigned as a cylindrical container.",

      "question": "Are floral patterns embossed in golden foil on the surface of the teapot container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cylindrical container with a golden surface. The floral patterns are integrated into the container's design, specifically depicted in a printed format rather than embossed or in golden foil. Embossing involves a raised surface that could be distinguished by casting shadows or highlighting light reflections, which are not apparent. Thus, the reasoning concludes that the patterns are printed, not embossed or golden.",

      "question": "Are the teacups redesigned as nested stackable units, each with a decorative lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evidence of teacups or similar units displayed. The image primarily features a cylindrical container with no additional items shown that resemble teacups or nested units accompanied by lids. The analysis rules out the presence or redesign of teacups as described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there Japanese calligraphy displayed across the top of the packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the cylindrical container in Image B contains text elements, however, these appear to be more akin to stylized English script rather than distinct Japanese calligraphy, which typically features unique character shapes and strokes. The analysis involves recognizing these differences in script style and concludes that meaningful Japanese calligraphy is not present at the top.",

      "question": "Is a bamboo motif visible along the side of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On Image B, there is a visible representation of a bamboo motif on the side of the cylindrical container, identifiable by the characteristic long, jointed, rod aesthetic typical of bamboo plants. This observation draws upon visual recognition of common bamboo imagery and concludes the visibility of such a motif.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the entire tea set packaging presented on a flat white surface with no other background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Image B displays the cylindrical container on a flat white surface without additional elements in the background, creating a minimalistic and clear presentation akin to typical product photography intended for focus on the item itself. The absence of other design elements confirms the composed simplicity of the setting.",
