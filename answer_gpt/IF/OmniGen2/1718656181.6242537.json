      "question": "Is the explosion depicted as a mural painted on a beach wall, rather than occurring naturally in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clues that suggest the explosion is depicted as part of a mural rather than a realistic scene. The background appears flat and colorful, with evenly distributed bright colors typical of wall art. The explosion and other elements like palm trees are stylized, reinforcing the feel of an illustration or mural. This analysis combines visual observation with the understanding that such art is often painted in vibrant styles on flat surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the explosion and surrounding elements bright and neon-like, consistent with pop art aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays extremely vivid colors such as bright yellows, pinks, and blues, which are characteristic of the neon palettes frequently seen in pop art. Such strong color choices contribute to the eye-catching and bold aesthetic typical of this art style. This interpretation aligns with the observation of pop art trends and common use of neon tones.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all major elements (explosion, clouds, palm trees, landforms) have thick black outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all the major elements including the explosion, clouds, palm trees, and landforms are distinctly outlined with thick black lines. This style is consistent with cartoon and pop art illustrations that emphasize forms through strong outlines. Observing these visual cues and their common usage in graphic art styles assists in making this determination.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the palm trees stylized with exaggerated forms and bold outlines, consistent with pop art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm trees in Image B appear exaggerated in their form and are highlighted by bold outlines, consistent with pop art's stylized approach. Their design lacks realistic texture and favors simplicity over detail. The analysis combines the visual style seen with general knowledge of pop art's tendencies towards stylized and exaggerated forms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are geometric patterns (e.g., stripes, grids, polygons) visibly embedded within the cloud formations of the explosion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible presence of geometric patterns such as stripes, grids, or polygons within the cloud formations of the explosion. The clouds are depicted in stylized, simplified shapes consistent with cartoonish and pop-art designs. This conclusion is drawn by examining the visual elements and recognizing a lack of geometric detailing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the island landscape been transformed into simplified abstract shapes, lacking realistic terrain details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The island landscape in Image B has been transformed into very simplified shapes with little to no realistic terrain detail. The colors are bright and flat, and the landforms are stylized without natural textures or variations. This assessment combines observed visual features with the understanding of abstract art styles that prioritize simplicity over realistic representation.",
