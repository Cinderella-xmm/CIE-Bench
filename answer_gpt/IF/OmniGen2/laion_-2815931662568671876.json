        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is split into two sections, each illustrating a different scene involving the anthropomorphic guacamole character.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no representation of a tortilla chip as an anthropomorphic character. Instead, there is a guacamole mound personified as a character. Therefore, no large tortilla chip with a monocle and a curious expression is present.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 1 in Image B features an anthropomorphic guacamole character but the setting does not exhibit characteristics of a rustic kitchen with a spice rack. It appears more festive with decorations like bunting rather than kitchen furnishings.",
