      "question": "Is the grand piano replaced with a cookie sculpture that retains the same overall shape and structure as the original piano?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object positioned similarly to a grand piano is indeed a sculpture resembling a piano but made from a material that appears edible, likely a cookie, indicating a transformation from the expected musical instrument seen in performance settings. The shape and proportions of the piano, such as its body and lid, are maintained to resemble the traditional design, although materials are obviously different, leading to the conclusion based on visual cues and common sense of artistic representation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the surface of the piano sculpture uniformly colored in a rich caramel hue instead of glossy black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the piano sculpture with a consistent coloring that resembles caramel, which is markedly different from the typical reflective black finish of grand pianos. Caramel hues are common in edible goods such as cookies, reinforcing the interpretation of the sculpture as an edible item.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible white and gold icing designs on the cookie piano that replicate the ornate details of the original piano?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the cookie piano with decorative white icing on the top surface, used to provide some decorative element. However, the designs are simple and do not attempt to replicate the complexity and detail of artistic elements like gold or intricate carvings seen on traditional grand pianos inside an opulent theater setting, where more sophisticated ornaments would be present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the piano keys made of embedded sugar crystals rather than solid black or white material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keys of the piano sculpture in Image B are designed to look as though they are made of an edible substance, likely resembling sugar crystals or a similar material, which distinguishes them from the solid material found on real pianos. The visual patterns seen indicate an intention to imitate the granular structure seen in sugar-based decorative items.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cookie piano positioned on a plain white marble tabletop, devoid of any surrounding stage, audience, or theater elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly places the cookie piano on a smooth white surface resembling a marble tabletop, lacking any elements typical of a stage or audience setting such as the grandeur, seating, or architectural details prevalent in concert halls, seen in Image A. This suggests a focus on showcasing the sculpture in isolation from the typical context of a musical performance.",
