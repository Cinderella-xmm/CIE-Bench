      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a clear glass dome covering the entire scene, enclosing the house, lake, and surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a transparent cover that extends from the base to the top, enclosing all elements including the house, trees, and a lake. The clear nature and uniform shape of the cover suggest it is a glass dome, much like those used to protect and display delicate or ornamental items. The reflections on the surface and overall shape further confirm that this is indeed a glass dome.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible mossy green pathways leading toward or around the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows areas of bright green surrounding the house, especially on the base platform where the house is situated. However, these areas appear to be uniform patches of grass rather than distinct pathways. The visual representation and the context suggest they are primarily decorative moss or grass patches instead of pathways.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there multiple tiny shrubs added around the house and along the pathways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are several small, well-defined trees placed around the house. These resemble miniature shrubs or coniferous trees, as seen in model displays. However, their positioning does not align with pathways as there are no visible paths in Image B; they are instead placed decoratively around the lake and house.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a lake with a shiny, silver-colored surface present in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene includes a lake that reflects light, showing a shiny surface. However, the color predominantly appears as blue, with light reflecting to create shininess, rather than a silver hue. This is consistent with how water would appear in bright conditions, with natural reflective qualities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there delicate fairy lights visible, wrapped around the miniature trees or foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small pinpoint lights are visible, which appear to be delicately placed around the trees and foliage, resembling fairy lights. These lights add a decorative touch and accentuate the miniatures, providing a whimsical aspect to the scene, suggesting they are indeed fairy lights.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small bridge crossing the lake and connecting to the entrance of the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small, clearly defined bridge structure connecting the shore of the lake to the entrance of the house. This bridge spans over the water, providing access directly to the house, which is a common design feature in miniature models to enhance realism and connectivity in the scene layout.",
