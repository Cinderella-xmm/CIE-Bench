    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sandcastle now presented as a scaled-down, highly detailed miniature 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle appears to be a small, ornate structure displayed inside a glass dome. The precise detailing and reduced size suggest it is a miniature 3D model rather than a life-sized sandcastle. The stand and environment further support that this is a model meant for display, not built on a beach.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sandcastle enclosed within a transparent spherical glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sandcastle inside a glass dome. The dome evenly covers the castle, with reflections indicating its transparency and spherical shape, which fits the description perfectly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass dome placed on a sculpted base made of mahogany wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the dome in Image B appears to be made from a dark, reddish-brown material commonly associated with mahogany wood. The refined finish and classic wooden design support the notion that it is sculpted mahogany.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are fine, glittering grains visibly applied to the surface of the sandcastle to simulate a sandy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the sandcastle model is highly detailed, in Image B, there is no obvious indication of glittering grains applied to simulate sand texture; the surface of the castle appears smooth rather than textured with grains.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are tiny, ornately detailed seashells placed around the base of the sandcastle model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding environment of the sandcastle within the dome includes a few seashells placed around the base, which appear to be carefully arranged and detailed, contributing to the seaside theme within the display.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the entire model and surrounding elements have a soft, matte pearl-like finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandcastle model in Image B inside the glass dome does exhibit a soft, matte finish, but it does not display an evident pearl-like sheen; it maintains a sandy color rather than a lustrous one.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a ceramic plaque with the words “Empire of the Shores” elegantly inscribed and visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a plaque visible on the sand model in the glass dome with the words 'Empire of the Shores' written on it, serving as a label or title for the display.",
