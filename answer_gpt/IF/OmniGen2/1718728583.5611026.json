    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the robot feature streamlined, symmetrical forms with chrome or highly reflective metallic surfaces typical of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis involves examining the design and surface of the robot in the edited image. The robot features smooth, symmetrical shapes with a highly reflective surface, which is characteristic of Art Deco design. The metallic finish suggests elements of this design style.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the flamingos depicted as stylized geometric patterns rather than realistic birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing the flamingos in the edited image, they appear to have exaggerated, geometric features such as uniform curves and shapes, which are more stylized rather than realistic representations of flamingos.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the palm trees in the background have angular, geometric forms instead of natural, curved shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the palm trees are shaped more geometrically and angular, lacking the natural curves and randomness seen in real palm trees. This stylized approach gives them a more artificial appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the rocks in the background rendered with stylized, geometric shapes rather than natural rock formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rocks in the edited image appear more angular and stylized, lacking the irregularities and textures of natural rock formations, indicating a geometric approach to their depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene rendered in a muted pastel color palette, avoiding strong or vibrant hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette of the edited image uses muted pastel tones, evident in the flamingos, palm trees, and sandy backdrop, creating a soft, subdued visual effect without vibrant or strong colors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the robot positioned centrally among the flamingos, maintaining the original compositional layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the robot is indeed centrally placed amongst the flamingos, which is consistent with maintaining a similar compositional layout as the original image.",
