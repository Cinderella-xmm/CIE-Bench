      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a teapot with a rounded body, similar to the original spherical or bulbous design associated with traditional teapots. Based on the visual information, the teapot retains a classic teapot shape with curved and intricate engravings rather than having a sleek cylindrical form. Hence, the body is not transformed into a cylindrical shape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the teapot features prominent dragon engravings visible on its surface. These engravings are deeply etched and detailed, portraying the distinct features of dragons. This aligns with the traditional aesthetic where dragons are commonly used motifs in decorative art.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lid on Image B remains consistent with the design typically seen on decorative teapots featuring intricate patterns. It appears to be a traditional teapot lid with a handle on top, rather than a modern screw cap design. The visual cues suggest it is not a screw cap but maintains the traditional hinged design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lid of the teapot displays textured patterns around its circumference. However, these patterns consist of abstract designs rather than specific tea leaf shapes, and the lid is not identified as a screw cap. Therefore, intricate tea leaf patterns are not embossed around a screw cap.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the spout of the teapot with a smooth surface where no text is visibly inscribed. The teapot retains its ornamental design without any textual additions to disrupt its aesthetic. As a result, 'Dragon's Delight' is not inscribed along the spout.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top center of the lid in Image B showcases an ornamental knob, typical of traditional teapot designs. No minimalist logo, including any tea leaf design, is present on this knob. The teapot maintains its classic decorative lid design, without a screw cap featuring a minimalist tea leaf logo.",
