      "question": "Does the butterfly have its antennae positioned or depicted in a way that suggests motion resembling a conductor's baton?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's antennae are extended outwards and slightly curved. This posture can be seen as resembling a conductor's baton in motion, part of the artistic choice to evoke a sense of orchestration or symphony as supported by the scene's title. Combining this observation with the theme suggested by the title strengthens the interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there faint sheet music patterns, such as musical notes or staff lines, visible within the orange areas of the butterfly’s wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon careful examination of Image B, the orange areas of the butterfly’s wings appear bright and uniform without any visible sheet music patterns, symbols, or lines. While the theme may suggest musical elements, the visual inspection doesn't confirm this pattern representation on the butterfly.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the flowers around the butterfly have petals shaped like musical notes or arranged in a way that suggests rhythmic swaying?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flowers in Image B are drawn with traditional petal shapes, resembling typical garden flowers without features resembling musical notes. Their arrangement is in a curved and harmonious layout, but they do not visually suggest rhythmic swaying or music symbols either.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the flowers rendered in soft, pastel color tones rather than vivid or saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flowers in Image B are depicted in vibrant colors (pink, orange, purple) that are distinct and saturated, indicating more vivid tones than soft or pastel colors typically have. This suggests a bright and lively design rather than subdued pastel tones.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the title as 'Moniard's Garden Symphony' in a flowing, elegant script font above the butterfly. The choice of font supports the thematic suggestion of an orchestrated or artistic scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is centrally positioned, and the surrounding flowers are arranged in a semi-circular form, partially enclosing the butterfly. This layout supports the harmonious design implied by the title.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a bright, clear lighting scheme that emphasizes vibrant colors and sharp details rather than soft lighting, gentle shadows, or glowing effects. The focus seems to be more on clarity and vivid contrast than creating a dreamy atmosphere.",
