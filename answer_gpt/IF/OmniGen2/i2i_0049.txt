}

}

    "Question": "Q4: Does the edited image maintain a calm and solitary atmosphere without extra distractions?",
    "explanation": "Image B has a simple background with a single solid green color, which eliminates any additional background details. While this may make the scene less complex, the bright green color itself is quite striking and not typically associated with a calm atmosphere.",

}
