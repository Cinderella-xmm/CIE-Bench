      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is altered to create a product presentation for a tea brand. The objects from the original tea scene are placed on a platform typical of product displays, with the addition of labels and decorative texts like 'En Tuonin Autun Tea' and 'Zen Autumn' marking it as a branded product. The surrounding decorative elements, such as the leaves and muted color palette, further emphasize the conceptual nature of the tea brand packaging design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central table is transformed into a flat surface akin to a tea box lid, as demonstrated by the distinct rectangular presentation platform typical of product packaging.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tea cups are illustrated similarly to typical ceramic or traditional teacups, without any visual cues to suggest they are made from sustainable materials like bamboo, recycled paper, or plant-based plastics.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is not enclosed within a leaf-shaped silhouette; instead, it rests on a rectangular platform typical for product displays. The teapot has no visible earthy textures like wood grain or soil tones; it is depicted in a standard form without special textural details to imply organic origin.",
