      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop-style box is displayed at an angle where two sides of the box are visible, specifically the front and one side.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual examination of Image B reveals that the chibi-style figure inside the packaging is depicted holding a bat in one hand, which is a common accessory for a baseball-themed figure.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure is seen holding a bat, while there is also a clear depiction of the figure's details, but no presence of a ball or a glove is visible as accompanying elements either within the figure's grasp or close to it. Thus, these signature items are not part of the composition.",
