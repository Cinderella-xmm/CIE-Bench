    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire scene, including the laundromat and the person holding laundry, depicted using Lego bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene is rendered in a style that resembles Lego construction. The person, laundry, and the laundromat all exhibit characteristics of Lego designs such as block shapes, interlocking pieces, and the distinctive appearance of Lego figures and objects. Given these visual cues and common knowledge of Lego's appearance, it's reasonable to conclude that the entire scene is depicted using Lego bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the person and the folded laundry represented as Lego figures and objects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the person and the laundry are clearly depicted with the distinct style of Lego figures and objects. The person has the classic yellow Lego minifigure features with blocky limbs and a painted-on face, while the laundry consists of stacked pieces that mimic folded clothes using the limited shape options available in Lego sets. This representation aligns with the style and visual grammar of Lego figures and objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the laundromat environment, including the walls, doors, and washing machines, constructed using Lego bricks?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays the laundromat environment with a blocky, modular appearance that is characteristic of Lego constructions. The walls, door frames, and washing machines are depicted with simplistic block forms that align with the style of Lego architecture, suggesting they are constructed using Lego bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Does the scene have a static, constructed appearance typical of a stop-motion diorama?",
    "explanation": "Image B has a static appearance where all elements, including the figure and surroundings, are presented as fixed, interlocking pieces, typical of Lego models. This gives it the look of a constructed diorama, which would be suited for a stop-motion animation style where each piece remains static between frames, coinciding with the visual cues shown.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Has the overall scene composition been maintained while adapting it to the Lego aesthetic?",
    "explanation": "Both images depict a similar composition with the person holding folded laundry in front of a laundromat. In Image B, this composition is maintained even though all elements are transformed to resemble Lego, preserving the positions and relative arrangements of objects and figures in the scene while adopting a Lego aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
