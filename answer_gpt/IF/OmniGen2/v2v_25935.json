      "question": "Is the entire urban street scene recreated using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a scene where the entire urban environment, including buildings and street, appears to be made from Lego materials. The lighting, texture, and block-like features are characteristic of Lego constructs, which commonly use interlocking plastic bricks to depict various sceneries. This conclusion stems from the visual cues of smooth surfaces and the uniformity typical of Lego creations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cobblestones on the path represented using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the street is depicted using a pattern that resembles the typical Lego brick surface, featuring regular, interlocking sections that mimic cobblestones. Such a design matches the common style seen in Lego brick constructions where individual pieces form repetitive patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the buildings in the background recreated using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows buildings with a texture and appearance that align with Lego brick design. The smooth finish, clear demarcations, and rectangular shapes are indicative of Lego constructions, which commonly encapsulate architectural elements in block-like forms.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the man and his clothing, bag, and cap represented using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts figures that have the recognizable features of Lego minifigures, including a blocky torso, cylindrical appendages, and simplified accessories. The manâ€™s blue jacket, black cap, and brown bag appear plastic-like, suggestive of their Lego brick rendition.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the original composition and perspective of the urban street scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images, A and B, display a scene with similar composition and perspective. In Image B, the angle at which the street and buildings are presented, along with the positioning of the figures, corresponds closely to Image A, albeit remade using Lego. This assessment relies on the recognition of spatial arrangement and viewpoint continuity.",
