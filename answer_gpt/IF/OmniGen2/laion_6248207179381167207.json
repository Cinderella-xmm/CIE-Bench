      "question": "Are the patterned surfaces of the handbag replaced with sleek geometric silver and turquoise motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handbag features a transformation from its classic monogrammed surface (seen in Image A) to a new design with bold geometric patterns. These patterns incorporate silver and turquoise colors, replacing the traditional brown and tan Louis Vuitton monogram. The distinct shapes and metallic look suggest an intentional design shift towards sleeker and more modern aesthetics. This aligns with the query about geometric silver and turquoise motifs.",
