    "Question": "Q1: Is the object now a tall, rectangular glass vessel instead of a soft-sided suitcase?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object retains the shape and structure of a suitcase, with clearly visible handles, zippers, and wheels. The dimensions and design are consistent with a suitcase rather than a vessel. The material used on the front appears to be a glossy surface with a purple hue, which could suggest a hard surface, but does not change the object's overall identity from a suitcase to a glass vessel.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Has the retractable handle been transformed into a metallic spray nozzle positioned at the top of the vessel?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the handle remains the same as in a standard suitcase, with no sign of transformation into a spray nozzle. It is visibly a standard telescopic handle used for maneuvering suitcases.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the side and front panels now made of translucent purple-tinted material instead of fabric?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front panel of the suitcase appears to be made of a glossy, purple-tinted material, suggesting a transformation from the original fabric to a hard, possibly translucent surface. The sides still appear to be a typical suitcase material. This indicates a partial transformation focusing on the front panel aspect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the original seam lines preserved as embossed linear patterns on the surface of the vessel?",
    "explanation": "Considering Image B, the surface does not have visible seam lines like typical fabric suitcase stitching. The embossed lines are not present due to the changes in texture and appearance of the front panel, which now appears smooth and glossy.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there an etched logo visible near the top of the vessel?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a logo near the top of the suitcase on its glossy surface. While the material can imply an etching-like appearance, the presence of the logo aligns with the question of visibility. The logo appears to be part of the updated design in a contrasting color.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Have the wheels been replaced with decorative caps at the base of the vessel?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels remain the same as those found on a suitcase, maintaining their functionality and appearance. There is no indication that they have been replaced with decorative caps.",
    "answer": "No"
