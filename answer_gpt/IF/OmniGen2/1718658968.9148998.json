      "question": "Are the surfaces of the castle composed of visible wooden puzzle pieces with natural oak and mahogany coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle's surface is clearly made of wooden puzzle pieces, which are characterized by their distinct edges and joints. The coloring appears to mimic natural wood tones such as oak and mahogany, evident from the grain and texture of the material shown. This indicates a deliberate stylistic choice in the design of the castle, as opposed to any stone or concrete texture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the castle retain its original architectural structure, including two towers, arched entrance, multiple windows, and connecting walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts a structure with the same architectural elements as traditionally seen in castles: two prominent towers, an arched entrance, visible windows, and walls connecting these parts. The silhouette and layout are indicative of a castle-like design, akin to historical or fictional representations. By comparing basic layouts without focusing entirely on materials, both images show similar castle architecture features like towers and arches.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tops of both towers display detailed interlocking puzzle piece patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the top section of the towers in Image B, there is a clear interlock pattern at the edges suggesting puzzle piece construction, which resembles the characteristic notches and protrusions of a jigsaw puzzle. This pattern is a departure from traditional architecture in Image A, indicating a creative rebuilding using puzzle-like components.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the castle placed on a smooth, flat wooden tabletop that serves as the new base of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the castle being placed upon a wooden surface, which is visibly distinct, smooth, and flat compared to the natural ground or water that might have been present in Image A. Such a surface suggests a deliberate presentation typically found in crafted displays, rather than a continuation of a natural environment or landscape.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the wooden components of the castle visibly segmented into individual puzzle-like pieces with defined edges and joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the castle is composed of clearly segmented wooden pieces, each defined by edges and joints characteristic of an interlocking mechanism, comparable to puzzle pieces. This segmentation is visually obvious and contributes to the assembled appearance of the castle.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the reflective water in front of the castle absent or replaced by the wooden tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area in front of the castle where water was visible in Image A is no longer present, having been replaced by the wooden tabletop. This background change is crucial, as it redefines the scene from a naturalistic environment to a more controlled display space.",
