    "Question": "Q1: Is the child depicted with exaggerated cartoon-style features such as large eyes, oversized head, or stylized expression?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the child is illustrated in a cartoon style. Typically, cartoon styles often exaggerate certain features like large eyes or oversized heads to emphasize expressiveness and appeal to a younger audience. However, without focusing on blurred facial features, the depiction of the child as seen in Image B seems to maintain relatively natural proportions in terms of body size and limb length, appearing as quite life-like especially in the context of the vibrant colors and setting. Thus, based on these observations, the answer would be 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the coat and balloons rendered in pastel colors (soft, desaturated hues) rather than vibrant or saturated tones?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the coat and balloons exhibit bright and vivid hues. Pastel colors are characterized by their soft, muted, and desaturated quality, often appearing light and gentle. However, in this image, the yellows, blues, and reds of the coat and balloons are highly saturated and energetic, contrasting with the more subdued nature of pastels. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a calendar grid displayed below the child, appearing as if it is hanging or attached to the scene?",
    "explanation": "Image B indeed features a calendar grid situated below the child, and it is visually integrated into the scene as though it was part of the environment. This suggests the calendar is resting at the base of the foreground, contributing an additional layer to the overall composition. Therefore, the correct choice is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the balloons visually associated with individual days in the calendar grid, such that each balloon corresponds to a single day?",

The balloons are presented as separate elements without explicit links to specific calendar dates. Thus, the correct response is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
