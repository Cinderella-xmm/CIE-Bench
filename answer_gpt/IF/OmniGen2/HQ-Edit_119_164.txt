    "Question": "Q1: Does the elephant’s skin feature a galaxy-patterned texture with visible stars, nebulae, and cosmic swirls?",
    "explanation": "The edited image features an elephant whose skin is depicted with bright, vibrant colors that resemble patterns commonly associated with galaxies. There are visible stars and swirling textures integrated into the skin design, which suggests a cosmic theme. This is determined by recognizing the visible star-like points and swirling nebula-like color formations across the image. These elements visually symbolize cosmic patterns.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the elephant’s tusks exhibit a shimmering, nebula-like appearance with glowing, cloud-like textures?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining the tusks in the edited image, they appear to have a luminescent quality with a cloud-like texture that resembles a nebula. The glow and diffuse appearance provide a sense of celestial object overlay on the tusks. This conclusion is based on the consistent nebula theme found across other parts of the image, reinforcing the tusks' appearance as part of this cosmic motif.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the elephant’s ears replaced with vast, sail-like structures that reflect starry constellations and have a celestial appearance?",
    "explanation": "The edited image depicts the elephant's ears in a way that they appear enlarged, reflecting bright and colorful constellations that resemble sails. The ear structures have a vibrant and celestial overlay with star-like details, giving the impression of vast sailing structures.
