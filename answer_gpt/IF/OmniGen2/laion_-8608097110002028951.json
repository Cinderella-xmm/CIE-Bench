      "question": "Is the facade of the theater building constructed from visible tan LEGO bricks with brown accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facade retains its architectural features similar to a standard building with visible textures and details that are typically found in real-life construction. Although the color has been changed to a bright yellow with brown accents, the surface does not show typical LEGO brick studs or interlocking features. LEGO bricks usually have a distinct pattern, but that is not apparent on the facade; hence, it does not exhibit the characteristics of being made from LEGO bricks.",

      "question": "Are the large arched windows replaced with translucent square LEGO pieces arranged in a grid pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the large arched windows with a grid pattern, similar to the original Image A. The windows have a translucent appearance which might be perceived as LEGO-like due to the grid arrangement, but there are no visible LEGO studs or the typical plastic sheen associated with LEGO bricks.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the marquee signs for \"Walgreens\" and \"Marina Theater\" rendered using smooth red flat LEGO bricks to form the letters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marquee signs in Image B are depicted in solid red color but do not feature the block structure characteristic of LEGO bricks. Letters formed using LEGO bricks typically have noticeable edges and textures, which are not apparent in the signs. Instead, the signs appear to have a smooth finish without individual bricks forming the letters.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both vintage cars rendered as blocky LEGO vehicles, one in black and one in purple, with angular, modular features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cars in Image B are painted purple, giving a colorful and playful look. However, they do not display the blocky, angular, or modular construction consistent with LEGO vehicles. Vintage cars depicted as LEGO models generally have visible LEGO features such as studs and specific angular connections, which are absent here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene—including the building, cars, and signage—appear as a cohesive, playful, miniature LEGO model with consistent blocky textures and toy-like proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the scene in Image B shows vibrant colors with red accents, the textures and proportions do not reflect a miniature LEGO model. There is no consistent visual evidence of blockiness or toy-like proportions associated with LEGO models. The scene retains realistic architectural details and shapes throughout, which do not suggest LEGO construction.",
