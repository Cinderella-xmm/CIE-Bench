    "Question": "Q1: Is there a clearly defined collectible figure present in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the objects on the dresser include a vase with flowers, candles, and a decorative lantern. There is no object that visually matches the common appearance of a 'collectible figure,' such as a figurine or statue of a character or object, which is typically what is referred to as a collectible figure. These items are more aligned with home decor elements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the collectible figure placed on a surface suitable for a desk ornament?",
    "explanation": "As identified in the previous question, there is no collectible figure present in Image B. The dresser does have objects like candles, a book, and a vase, which are common desk or dresser ornaments, but none are considered collectible figures. Without a collectible figure, the question of suitable placement becomes moot.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the collectible figure maintain visual harmony with the overall composition of the room?",
    "explanation": "Since there is no collectible figure present in Image B, it cannot affect or maintain visual harmony within the room. The existing decor, such as the mirror, vase with flowers, and candles, however, do harmonize with the minimalist and neutral style of the room.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the collectible figure obscure or overshadow key elements such as the mirror or existing decorations?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no collectible figure present, thus nothing to obscure or overshadow other elements such as the large round mirror or the decorative items on the dresser. The current elements are coherently placed and do not clutter or overshadow each other.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the collectible figure appear seamlessly integrated into the scene as though it is a natural part of the composition?",
    "explanation": "Given that there is no collectible figure in Image B, this question does not apply. The other visible items, such as the vase, candles, and decorative lantern, integrate well within the scene and with each other, maintaining a balanced composition. However, these items are not classified as collectible figures.",
