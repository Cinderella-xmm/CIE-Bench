      "question": "Does the image feature a gradient background with pastel colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background colors transition smoothly between different shades of blue at the bottom and pink towards the top, creating a gradient effect. These colors are more vivid than typical pastels, but they align with common vaporwave and neon color schemes. The overall effect is reminiscent of a gradient but with brighter, more saturated colors characteristic of neon lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible neon lighting effects around the mirror or sink area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features bold neon lighting effects, particularly around the edges of the mirror, which is framed by a bright pink neon border. This change transforms the lighting from the original warm tone in Image A to a vivid neon style, which is typical of vaporwave aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the overall bathroom scene been transformed into a retro-futuristic style characteristic of vaporwave?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neon lighting around the mirror and the gradient background are key elements of vaporwave style, which blends retro and futuristic elements. The vivid colors and bright neon lights contribute to a retro-futuristic atmosphere commonly associated with vaporwave, characterized by vibrant colors and nostalgic aesthetics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the gradient background consistently applied throughout the bathroom scene without disrupting the visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gradient background in Image B transitions smoothly from blue to pink, which is consistently applied across the wall space behind the sink and mirror. The integration of this gradient does not disrupt the visual coherence; rather, it enhances the scene by creating a cohesive vaporwave atmosphere.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the original objects like the mirror, sink, and cabinet retain their form but now reflect a vaporwave design influence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shapes and forms of the mirror, sink, and cabinet remain consistent with those in Image A. However, the lighting and color scheme of the objects have been altered significantly to reflect a vaporwave design influence with brighter neon colors and a futuristic aesthetic.",
