      "question": "Has the wooden surface been replaced with an elegant marble texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the teapot is clearly a marble texture, identified by its characteristic smooth, shiny surface and the pattern typical of marble, which contrasts with the wooden surface seen in Image A. The wood in Image A has a more textured, grainy appearance with visible wood patterns and colors. Recognizing these materials is based on common world knowledge of how marble and wood surfaces appear.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a transparent label overlaid on the teapot with visible text including \"Earl Grey Elegance\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a teapot with a visible label on its side that includes the text 'Earl Grey Elegance.' The label visually appears to match typical design elements found in luxury packaging, using clear and readable typography set against the teapot's finish. This contrasts with Image A, where no such label or text is present. Understanding the nature of product labeling in branding and marketing aids in recognizing this change.",

      "question": "Is there a finely embossed gold monogram logo visible on the lid of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, there is no distinct, finely embossed gold monogram logo visible on the lid of the teapot. The lid has intricate designs, but they do not appear to form a specific monogram logo. In comparison, Image A also shows detailed patterns but lacks any form of distinct logo. Since the question targets specific logo identification, world knowledge about monogram styles suggests that an embossed logo would be prominently visible if present, which it is not in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a box present in the image with engravings similar in style to those on the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a box situated behind the teapot, which has engravings. These engravings include text and logos consistent with those seen on the teapot and are part of the overall presentation. The similarity in style between the box engravings and those on the teapot indicates a cohesive design theme. Contrarily, Image A does not contain a box, meaning no comparison of style elements can be drawn.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition reflect a luxury tea brand packaging design with cohesive branding elements such as elegant textures, consistent engravings, and premium presentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates elements commonly associated with luxury brand packaging, such as the use of marble texture, gold accents, clear and sophisticated label, and the presence of a branded box, indicating a high-end product presentation. These elements contrast with Image A, which lacks such refined design features and luxury branding elements, instead showing a more traditional teapot setup. The understanding of luxury branding helps in recognizing these design and presentation upgrades.",
