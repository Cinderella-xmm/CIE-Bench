      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the entire cruise ship been replaced with translucent, iridescent crystal structures that resemble a palace?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original cruise ship has been replaced with a structure that appears to be made of clear, crystalline material, forming intricate patterns and shapes that resemble an elaborate palace. This replacement of the original ship structure with a crystal palace is visually evident.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the hull been replaced with clear, angular, and faceted crystal structures rather than a smooth, solid form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hull of the ship in Image B has been replaced with angular and faceted crystal structures, as opposed to the smooth and solid hull seen in Image A. This crystal design mimics geometric patterns typical of crystals.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all windows been transformed into multifaceted gem-like elements with visible facets and reflective properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows from Image A are now part of the crystal structures, featuring multifaceted surfaces that mimic gem-like properties, unlike the smooth, traditional windows on the ship in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the decks been replaced with intricate, transparent crystal pathways featuring detailed patterns or latticework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decks in Image A, which are traditional, have been transformed in Image B into intricate pathways formed by the crystal structures. These pathways imply a complex pattern and detail work, characteristic of lattice or intricate design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the background been simplified to a minimalist horizon with no visible islands or complex terrain, emphasizing the crystal ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the original background with visible islands and complex terrain, similar to Image A. Therefore, the background has not been simplified to the extent of eliminating these features entirely.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there strong visual contrast between the shimmering, iridescent crystal ship and the minimalist background, enhancing the perception of brilliance and transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is a distinct visual contrast due to the shimmering nature of the crystal ship against the background, the background is not minimalist as there are still islands visible, which diminishes the potential contrast compared to a truly minimalist background.",
