      "question": "Is the entire body of the truck constructed from visible LEGO bricks in orange, black, and silver colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a toy truck clearly made from LEGO bricks, with visible studs characteristic of LEGO construction. The colors of the bricks are orange, black, and silver, as observed from the truck's cab and body panels. Based on the consistent pattern and recognizable texture of LEGO bricks, it is evident that the entire structure of the truck in Image B is composed of these materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the wheels composed entirely of circular gray LEGO pieces, replacing the original tire and rim design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheels in Image B appear as circular gray LEGO parts, fitting the expected design for LEGO wheels and differing from the aesthetic of real tires and rims. The LEGO model's wheel design matches those typically found in LEGO vehicle kits, suggesting the complete construction of wheels from these components.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth black LEGO tiles, replacing the original textured surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck bed seems to be composed of LEGO elements that include smooth black tiles. These pieces replace the real truck's original textured surface observed in typical vehicle beds. Given the uniform appearance of LEGO tiles, it is reasonable to infer the truck bed in Image B is covered this way.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO truck placed on a plain white shelf that elevates it above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO truck resting on a flat, plain white surface that functions as a shelf, visually elevating the toy from the surrounding environment. This setup contrasts with typical living space flooring, indicating elevation by shelf placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the LEGO model retain the correct shape and proportions of the original pickup truck, including the cab, bed, and wheelbase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model approximates the general shape of a pickup truck, including features like the cab, bed, and wheelbase. However, LEGO's inherent design limitations regarding precise proportion replication suggest variations compared to the real truck's exact dimensions and details. Pickup trucks' shapes are distinct, yet LEGO models often prioritize stylized representations over exact scaling.",
