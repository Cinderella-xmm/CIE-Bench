    "Question": "Q1: Are the overall lines and contours of the image now clear and well-defined?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the overall presentation is characterized by sharp lines and clear contours due to the high-contrast colors and bold outlines.

The clarity of different elements is accentuated, such as the outlines of the mannequins, bags, and figures, which are made more prominent than in Image A.",

    "Question": "Q2: Have the original textures been replaced with soft gradient blocks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, detailed textures like those seen in the fabric of clothing and building materials in Image A have been substituted with flat color blocks.

    "Question": "Q4: Are the edges and boundaries between elements in the image now sharply defined and crisp?",

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do areas previously filled with detailed textures now feature smooth, soft gradients instead?",
    "explanation": "Image B transforms areas which originally displayed complex textures, such as clothing fabrics and ground paving, into smoother, gradient-like fields. These provide a visually cohesive and less detailed representation without the intricate texture seen in Image A, contributing to the image's stylized simplicity.",
