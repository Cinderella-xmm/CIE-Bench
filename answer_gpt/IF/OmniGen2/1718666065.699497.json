        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn is depicted with a uniform, polished, and glossy appearance typical of glazed ceramics, characterized by its smooth texture and creamy white color.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mane and tail of the unicorn have distinct, curvilinear forms with intricate, uniform shapes resembling crafted porcelain.

        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background consists of plain walls and a neutral tone floor, typical of minimalist gallery spaces designed to focus attention on the exhibit.
