      "question": "Is the entire naval scene enclosed within a visible vintage glass lantern structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire naval scene appears to be housed under a glass dome, resembling a vintage bell jar or lantern. The reflection on the glass and the wooden base are visual cues that help identify the structure as a glass enclosure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the ship feature brass-colored finishes and visible rotating gears as part of its mechanical design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship showcases a brass or golden hue, which is distinct from typical naval gray finishes. The appearance of large gears suggests an industrial or steampunk aesthetic, indicating this is a stylized model rather than a traditionally finished ship.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures standing on the dock appear to be stylized with Victorian-style clothing, such as top hats and formal suits, which contrasts with modern casual attire. Their rigid posture and uniform appearance further suggest the nature of automatons.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays white, fluffy clouds hovering near the ship, which resemble steam. These clouds imply a dynamic, lively environment, akin to being powered by steam, thus highlighting the steampunk or Victorian industrial influence.",
