      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the overall image been given a cinematic appearance akin to a movie poster, with bold colors and dramatic lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors appear more vivid and dramatic, and the lighting has a pronounced contrast that one might associate with a cinematic or high-drama style, similar to movie posters that often use bold lighting and enhanced colors to grab attention. The lighting on the cars creates a dynamic and dramatic look, enhancing the cinematic feel.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the reflections on the cars enhanced, making them appear more glossy and shiny compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cars' surfaces exhibit increased glossiness, especially on the black car, where reflections are more pronounced and defined, indicating enhanced reflections. This change is visible because of the shinier surface, which often suggests post-processing to increase gloss.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there an increased level of environmental haze present in the image, creating a hazy effect around the surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears more blurred and dimmer than in Image A, which suggests an increased level of environmental haze. This kind of post-processing technique is often used to create mood and depth in images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the contrast enhanced in the image, resulting in sharper differences between light and dark areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the contrast is noticeably heightened, with darker darks and brighter highlights, which is evident in the traffic lights, cars, and road markings. This suggests that the image has been edited to increase the contrast, making features more distinct.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the opposing lanes and positioning of the cars waiting at the red light, combined with enhanced shadows and dramatic lighting, evoke a sense of confrontation or standoff, contributing to a dramatic, tense feeling.",
