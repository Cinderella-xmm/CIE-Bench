      "question": "Is the cactus transformed into a creature-like form with distinct features such as a face, body, and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus has indeed been transformed into a creature with a clearly visible face, body, and limbs. These are distinct features that indicate a departure from its original plant form to a more creature-like or anthropomorphic appearance. The creature's scales and other details back up this transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the creature’s scales feature patterns and colors matching those on the sombrero’s brim, such as floral and geometric designs in vibrant hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature has detailed scales, but they do not specifically feature the floral and geometric designs that match the brim of the sombrero. The sombrero itself has vivid patterns, but the scales are uniform in pattern and mainly focus on representing a reptile-like texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the terracotta pot been replaced with a stone-like base that serves as the creature’s feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is clearly no terracotta pot as seen in Image A, and instead, the creature has feet. This suggests that the base of the original plant (the pot) has been replaced or transformed into the creature's feet, supporting the transformation into a full anthropomorphic form.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the spines replaced with golden, shimmering quills that appear reflective or luminous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature does not appear to have golden, shimmering quills. The spines seen in Image A are not present on the creature, suggesting a lack of replacement with reflective or luminous quills.",

      "question": "Is there a visible, flowing sandy aura surrounding the creature, composed of particle-like textures resembling drifting sand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no apparent sandy aura surrounding the creature. The background depicts a typical desert scene, but there are no sand aura effects or any texture representing drifting sand around the creature itself.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature’s eyes are indeed bright and have a gem-like quality. They appear with topaz-like coloration, featuring reflective highlights that give them depth, and the expression conveyed is serene and watchful. This matches the description provided.",
