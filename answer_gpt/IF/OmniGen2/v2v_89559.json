      "question": "Have the 'Search for a Star' and 'Rising Star' logos been transformed into stylized, gleaming golden award statuettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Search for a Star' and 'Rising Star' logos appear as stylized graphic designs rather than gleaming golden award statuettes. They maintain their bold, colored design with a star motif, typical for logos. Therefore, they are not depicted as physical statuettes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background that looks like a rich, dark velvet curtain, providing a more luxurious and theatrical backdrop compared to the plain green background in Image A.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Sumo Digital' logo appears below the 'Rising Star' logo, but it is not embossed on a polished wooden plaque. Instead, it's placed next to the 'Rising Star' logo with a similar graphic design. There's an embossed seal present between the two main logos, but it doesnâ€™t integrate the 'Sumo Digital' text.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Sumoo 2018 Charactery 2018' text is showcased on a wooden plaque, which is different from the engraved silver lettering description. The text is stylized to fit the plaque graphic, rather than using an engraved silver appearance.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B includes significant background and style changes, the core elements such as the logos and their relative positions remain largely intact. The placement and layout are consistent, signifying structural integrity maintenance despite the stylistic adjustments.",
