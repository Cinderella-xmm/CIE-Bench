      "question": "Is the waterfall and surrounding rocks visibly transformed into the shape of an aquatic dragon emerging from the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a clearly defined aquatic dragon emerging from the water, complete with recognizable features like a dragon's body, tail, wings, and head, all distinct from any natural rock and waterfall formations. The visual cues directly depict a fantastical creature rather than a natural scene like in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the flowing water appear as a shimmering, translucent mane extending from the dragon’s head or neck area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a dragon with detailed features such as a mane comprised of stylized, translucent textures flowing from its head or neck area. This appearance mimics the look of flowing water, enhanced with glowing elements, which differ from the plain natural flow in Image A.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rocks reshaped into a scale-armored body structure that forms the torso or limbs of the dragon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocks do not retain their natural form and instead are illustrated as part of the dragon’s body, which is fully covered with scale-like textures, forming the torso and limbs of the creature, distinct from the unchanged rocks in Image A.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the white foam areas form two distinct, misty cloud-like wings attached to the dragon’s back or sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two distinct, cloud-like wings attached to the dragon's sides, which can be observed as part of the fantasy creature design. These wings are not made from the foam of a waterfall, as seen in Image A, indicating transformation rather than natural occurrence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there glowing blue runes visible along the dragon’s scales, appearing as luminous symbols or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows glowing blue runes or symbols along the dragon’s scales, adding a magical aspect to the creature’s design. Image A has no such features on the rocks or water, confirming that these elements are part of an artistic transformation in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image convey a mystical atmosphere through glowing effects, translucent textures, or ethereal lighting around the dragon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is filled with elements of glowing effects, such as luminous symbols and an ethereal glow around the dragon, along with translucent textures that contribute to a mystical atmosphere. This contrasts with the purely natural landscape of Image A.",
