      "question": "Does the male character's tee have a plush 3D appearance with a bold geometric pattern and an enlarged collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the male character's tee has a plush 3D appearance, which indicates a toy-like quality. The geometric pattern is present but not bold; it's a subtle design. The collar of the tee is not enlarged; it maintains a regular size relative to the overall chibi style of the figure. Image A shows a more realistic fabric texture without a 3D plush appearance, and the collar is regular-sized without any bold geometric patterns. Thus, in comparison, Image B presents a more exaggerated and tactile version, though not with a bold pattern or enlarged collar.",

      "question": "Are the male character's pants rendered in a plush 3D style with a bold geometric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The male character's pants in Image B are depicted in a plush-like 3D style typical of chibi figurines, but they lack a bold geometric pattern. They are a solid blue color without additional patterning. Image A's pants have a realistic fabric appearance with no hint of plushness or geometric patterns, only appearing dark colored. Therefore, based on Image B, the pants are plush but without bold patterns.",

      "question": "Do the female character's high-waisted pants feature exaggerated, prominent pleats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the female character's pants are high-waisted, the design is smooth and does not feature exaggerated or prominent pleats. They have a simple, streamlined design typical of a chibi figure. In Image A, the pants show a realistic creasing and pleating at the waist, indicative of a designed style in fabric. Comparing both, Image B lacks any pleats, let alone exaggerated ones.",

      "question": "Is the sleeve of the female character's top visibly enlarged compared to normal proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the female character's top does not feature visibly enlarged sleeves. The sleeves are designed in line with the chibi style, rounded and simplistic but not exaggeratedly large. In Image A, the sleeves are symmetrical and proportional to the overall size of the top, with no signs of being enlarged. Comparing both indicates that in Image B, the sleeves are consistent with the figurine's scale.",

      "question": "Are both characters rendered as chibi-style figurines with large heads, small bodies, and cartoonish proportions, dancing on a pastel-colored stage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both characters are depicted as chibi-style figurines, characterized by large heads and small bodies, which fits the cartoonish proportion description. They are standing on what appears to be a pastel-colored stage due to the backdrop and floor color, implying a set stage. Image A shows real persons with realistic proportions and no evident stage. Therefore, Image B accurately portrays them as chibi-style on a pastel stage.",

      "question": "Do the characters exhibit graceful dance poses, joyful expressions, and are placed on a pastel-colored stage, conveying playful elegance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the characters have chibi-style postures that are slightly dynamic, they do not specifically exhibit graceful dance poses. Their expressions are not visible due to the blur, and their stances do not convey specific expressions such as joy. However, the pastel-colored stage is present. Image A features realistic stances with no indications of dancing. Thus, although Image B sits on a pastel stage, it lacks the defined dance poses and visible joyful expressions.",
