    "Question": "Q2: Are the architectural elements of the church perfectly symmetrical on both sides?",

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the proportion of the church been altered to enhance its sense of grandeur and scale?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the church in a manner that retains realistic proportions without exaggerating its structure for added grandeur or scale. The semi-cartoon style may simplify the architectural features but does not necessarily alter its proportions for enhanced grandeur.",
    "answer": "No"

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there three separate architectural art prints displayed, each within a matte black frame?",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the three prints arranged in a trifold album format, with a central fold and two outer panels?",
