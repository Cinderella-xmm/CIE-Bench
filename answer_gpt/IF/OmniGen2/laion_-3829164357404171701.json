      "question": "Has the woven texture of the handbag been replaced with a scaly pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handbag still has a woven appearance, typical of a basket weave, although it is now more tightly woven compared to Image A. The pattern does not appear scaly, which would suggest a more detailed or repetitive pattern resembling scales of an animal, like a reptile. The texture visually resembles a regular woven basket, preserving the traditional look of basket material.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gray ribbons now appear as elegant wings rather than flat bows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gray ribbons maintain their bow shape similar to Image A. The ribbons are fashioned into loops typical of bows rather than appearing shaped or angled to resemble wings. Wings would generally have a more pointed or flowing structure, often with feather-like details, which is not indicated in the design of the bows.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the white flowers been transformed into eye-like features with surrounding ornate lashes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white flowers still resemble traditional artificial flowers rather than eyes. They retain their round, layered petal appearance which is typical for flowers, rather than mimicking the structure of an eye, which would have more defined, circular, and possibly glossy characteristics, potentially including details resembling lashes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two delicate, sparkling antenna-like structures present near the handle of the bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed two thin structures resembling delicate antennae protruding from near the handle of the bag. These structures are visually distinct and positioned at a slight angle, which supports the description of antenna-like features, differing from any design elements in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the chain been transformed into a serpentine tail that curls gracefully beneath the bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large black, scaly structure resembling a serpentine tail visible beneath the bag. It curls around the base, distinctively different from the chain which is visible in Image A, indicating a transformation into a tail rather than maintaining the appearance of a typical segment of chain links.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bag retain its original basket-like shape while being transformed into a creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall shape of the bag retains its rounded, basket-like form, similar to what is seen in Image A. Despite the addition of creature-like elements such as antennae and a tail, the fundamental structure and silhouette of the bag remain unchanged, indicating that it retains its original shape while incorporating these transformations.",
