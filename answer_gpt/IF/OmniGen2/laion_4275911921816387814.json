      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the dagger now rendered as a soft, plush toy rather than a rigid weapon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dagger has a soft and smooth appearance, which contrasts with the rigid and metallic look seen in Image A. The material in Image B appears to be plush or fabric-like, indicative of toy-like qualities that suggest it is meant as a plush toy rather than a functional weapon. The transformation from rigid metal to soft fabric reflects the change in its purpose from a weapon to a toy.",

      "question": "Is the blade made of soft, silver-gray fabric with black embroidered patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a blade that appears to be crafted from soft fabric, featuring black patterns that seem embroidered onto a silver-gray background. This contrasts with the metallic, engraved surface of the blade in Image A. The change in texture and appearance indicates a shift to a fabric material suited for a plush toy, with embroidery providing a decorative element rather than the functional purpose of a weapon.",

      "question": "Is the hilt made of a soft, faux ivory-like fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hilt has an ivory-like appearance but lacks the hard sheen found in real ivory, as observed in Image A. The softness and padded look of the hilt suggest it is fabricated from a textile, possibly faux ivory, aligning with the plush toy design where comfort and soft textures are paramount over authenticity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all edges of the plush dagger, including the hilt and blade, appear rounded and smooth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the dagger with rounded and smooth edges, a common feature of plush toys which prioritize safety and softness. This contrasts with Image A, where the dagger's edges are sharper and defined in alignment with its function as a weapon. The plush design in Image B minimizes safety concerns typical of hard or sharp objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the plush dagger appear stuffed and voluminous, with softened contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The contours of the dagger in Image B are softened and appear voluminous, characteristic of stuffed toys. This is evident in the plump appearance compared to the rigid and lean profile seen in Image A. The plush nature is emphasized by its padded appearance, which is consistent with toys designed for tactile enjoyment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the plush dagger placed against a solid-colored backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dagger placed against a vivid red backdrop, which is solid in color. This provides a clear, unadorned background, contrasting with the neutral setting of Image A, and helps to emphasize the object in Image B without distraction. This is often used in product or toy presentations to highlight the items depicted.",
