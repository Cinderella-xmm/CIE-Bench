      "question": "Is the sheep and clock scene enclosed within a transparent snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep and clock are clearly enclosed within a transparent snow globe, which is visually indicated by the glass dome encasing these objects. This is evident from the reflective surface and curved lines of light on the globe that suggest spherical transparency. This aligns with common representations of snow globes which are made of glass or clear plastic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the snow globe rest on a wooden tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe is positioned on a flat surface that appears to have a natural wood grain texture typical of a wooden tabletop. The color and subtle texture in the image suggest that the base is indeed a wooden tabletop, a common placement for decorative snow globes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the scene illuminated by gentle, ambient lighting, casting warm glows on the table and nearby areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is depicted as soft and warm, casting glows that highlight the snow globe and the table. This can be confirmed by the warm tones around the edges of the snow globe and the surface it rests upon, suggesting ambient lighting typically found in cozy settings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sheep and clock depicted as adorable chibi-style 3D models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the sheep and the clock have exaggerated, rounded features which are characteristic of chibi-style, suggesting a playful and adorable aesthetic. The sheep looks cartoonish and has softened features, and the style mimics that of 3D models designed to appear cute and stylized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sheep casually leaning against the clock inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep is positioned close to the clock, but there is no clear indication or visual evidence that it is physically leaning against the clock. The positioning seems more like a side-by-side arrangement rather than a leaning posture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there gently drifting snowflakes surrounding the sheep inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a transparent snow globe with small white flecks or dots scattered within, resembling snowflakes. This visual cue is typical for snow globes, where simulated snowflakes often float or rest on a surface, contributing to the theme.",
