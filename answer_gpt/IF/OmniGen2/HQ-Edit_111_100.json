      "question": "Is the warrior statue composed entirely of LEGO bricks, with visible brick-like elements forming its body, limbs, and head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior statue is clearly constructed from LEGO bricks, as indicated by the visible interlocking brick elements on its body, limbs, and head. The texture and structure are typical of LEGO pieces, showcasing the characteristic blocky appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor sections in Image B are formed using smooth LEGO bricks, as evidenced by their flat surfaces and lack of texturing or patterns. This aligns with the typical smooth surface of LEGO bricks.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
