      "question": "Is there a magnifying glass placed in the position of one book on a shelf, casting a noticeable shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a round object with a handle placed on top of a compact drawer-like piece of furniture, suggesting it is a magnifying glass. This placement does not correspond to a book on a shelf, but rather on a standalone piece, resulting in a shadow due to the light source from the window. The context of a study or library environment further supports the presence of a magnifying glass.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a silhouette of a figure in a trench coat and hat that resembles a detective's attire, prominently visible on the window. The silhouette is solid within the window's light and bears characteristics closely associated with a detective figure, suggesting an intentional addition to the image. This visual cue indicates a thematic link to detective narratives.",

      "question": "Has the overall color tone of the image been shifted to deep sepia, giving it a moody and aged appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette consists of warm, brownish tones that evoke a sepia filter, common in vintage or aged photographs. This gives the entire image a nostalgic and moody appearance, suitable for the atmosphere of an old library or study, reinforcing themes associated with historical or mysterious narratives.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, the text 'The Lost Legacy' is prominently displayed using a serif font, characterized by embellishments at the ends of the letters, which is a common choice for conveying a sense of tradition and gravitas.
