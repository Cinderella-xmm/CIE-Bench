      "question": "Is the word \"warm\" placed at the top left corner in large letters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'warm' is prominently displayed near the top center of the wall art, spanning horizontally across the artwork. The large size of the font makes the word stand out considerably against the background. By typical placement standards, it could be considered centrally located rather than strictly at the top left corner, suggesting a slight misalignment with the question. Therefore, the placement is not strictly as described in the top left corner.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'freedom' is indeed placed at the bottom right corner of the image on the sofa. It appears in a smaller font compared to the word 'warm,' making it less prominent but appropriately positioned in the corner area.",

      "question": "Are all original elements, such as the sofa, cushions, rug, plant, and wall art, still present without alteration except for additions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparing Image B to Image A, all the foundational elements such as the sofa, cushions, rug, plant, and wall art are still present in Image B without any alterations to their positions or appearances. The only changes in Image B include the addition of the textual elements 'warm' and 'freedom.' This comparison shows that the original elements remain intact and unchanged except for these text additions.",

      "question": "Does the image convey a \"home living\" feel with warm tones, soft lighting, and cozy arrangement of furniture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B continues to maintain a 'home living' ambiance due to the arrangement of furnishings, the presence of a soft lighting scenario through the window light, and warm sunset tones depicted in the artwork. These elements together create a comforting and cozy atmosphere typical of home living environments.",

      "question": "Is the text placement well-balanced so that it complements the rest of the image without disrupting the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The placement of 'warm' across the wall art and 'freedom' on the sofa is done in a manner that maintains a visual balance in Image B. The large 'warm' text integrates with the center of the artwork, drawing appropriate attention without overpowering, while 'freedom' is subtly integrated into the bottom corner of the sofa, ensuring cohesive visual flow throughout the setting. The textual elements complement the design rather than disrupt it.",
