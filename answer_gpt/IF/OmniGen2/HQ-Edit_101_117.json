      "question": "Is the mannequin now rendered as a stone sculpture rather than a metallic or plastic figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mannequin appears to have a matte finish and a muted color palette which could suggest a stone-like texture, deviating from the shinier appearance typical of plastic or metallic figures. The lack of metallic sheen or plastic gloss leads to the inference that the figure is meant to resemble a stone sculpture.",

      ],
