    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image formatted as an educational infographic with structured layout elements such as titles, labels, and text boxes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B organizes information with a clear structure, including a prominent title, labeled parts of the butterfly, and explanatory text boxes. These elements are characteristic of an educational infographic. The structured layout supports learning by separating and clarifying information visually, common in infographic designs.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the title “Butterfly Biology Basics” displayed prominently at the top or center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Butterfly Biology Basics' is prominently displayed at the top. This is a typical approach for infographics to inform viewers immediately about the subject of the content, highlighting the importance and central theme of the presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the anatomical parts (antennae, wings, abdomen, thorax) labeled with monochrome line-drawing overlays on the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show monochrome line-drawings directly over the butterfly itself but rather has small illustrative line drawings of specific body parts around the main butterfly image, with captions explaining their functions. While they contribute to the anatomy understanding, they are not directly overlaying the butterfly like labels.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are pink flower petals included in the image to represent the butterfly’s feeding preference?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes an illustration of a pink flower next to the butterfly, which could symbolize feeding preferences. Typically, butterflies are associated with flowers due to their role in pollination. The presence of the pink flower aligns with this concept within the infographic context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there text boxes in the image that explain the butterfly’s role in pollination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there are text boxes present in the infographic, the specific content of these text boxes is not readable. Without readable content directly stating the butterfly’s role in pollination, it's not evident from what's visible whether this information is covered.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the overall visual style delicate, with the butterfly’s vibrant blue color clearly emphasized as the central focal point?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B emphasizes the butterfly's vibrant blue color as the central visual element, which is typical for emphasizing a subject's importance in infographics. The coloration and focus suggest careful design meant to draw attention to the butterfly while being informative, indicating a delicate and thoughtful style.",
      "weight": 1,

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly maintains its vibrant blue color and overall appearance. Despite the additional infographic elements surrounding it, the butterfly itself remains intact and clear, preserving its original presentation as viewed in Image A.",
