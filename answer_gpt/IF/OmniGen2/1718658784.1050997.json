      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cake feature bold, graphic icing patterns such as geometric shapes, stripes, or repetitive motifs instead of realistic frosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is depicted with distinct horizontal stripes of color, a characteristic graphic design element, rather than realistic frosting textures seen in traditional cakes. The use of stripes is a bold and stylized choice, consistent with graphic design and pop art styles. This is different from the original cake in Image A, which uses realistic frosting with intricate detailing.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the balloons composed of vivid monochrome dots rather than solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balloons are shown with dotted patterns, especially noticeable on at least one balloon, which aligns with graphic techniques often seen in pop art, where patterns such as polka dots are used to create vibrant designs. This differs from Image A, where the balloons are solid colors without such patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the table rendered as a flat, solid color block without texture or gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the table is presented as a flat, solid red block without any texture or gradient, reflecting a simplified and stylized form typical of pop art. In contrast, Image A's table has visible wood texture, giving it a realistic appearance.",

      "question": "Is the vase depicted as a solid color block without visible texture or design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vase in Image B is a solid bright yellow color without any texture or intricate design, indicative of pop art style. This differs from Image A, where the vase features a detailed painted design.",

      "question": "Does the candle flame have exaggerated sharp lines and bright, saturated colors instead of a natural, soft glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the candle flame is represented with bold black outlines and a solid white color, creating a stylized, non-natural appearance aligned with pop art characteristics. This is unlike Image A, where the flame has a more natural glow with gradients typical of a real flame.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the entire image exhibit characteristics of pop art, including flat colors, bold outlines, and stylized forms across all elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B fully embodies the characteristics of pop art through the use of flat, bright colors, bold outlines around elements like balloons, cake, and candle, and the overall stylized representation of typical objects. This contrasts with Image A, which uses realistic textures and gradients. The image's composition contributes to the pop art aesthetic.",
