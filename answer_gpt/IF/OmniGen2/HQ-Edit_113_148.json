      "question": "Is the sandcastle rendered as a translucent crystal sculpture with visible facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is shown with clear, glass-like material that allows light to shine through, typical of a crystal sculpture. The edges and surfaces reflect and refract light, giving it a faceted appearance, which is characteristic of crystal. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the sandcastle is rendered as a translucent crystal sculpture with visible facets.",

      "question": "Are there soft blue highlights visible on the surface of the crystal castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the crystal structure displays a variety of subtle color hues caused by the interaction of light with its surfaces. These interactions commonly manifest as faint blue highlights, particularly when viewed under a bright setting like the one depicted in the image, where the light appears cool-toned. Hence, soft blue highlights should be visible on the surface of the crystal castle.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all seashells been replaced with small, polished gemstones in pastel hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what resembles hemispherical, smooth objects can be seen around the crystal structure. These objects appear polished and are arranged in small clusters like gemstones could be. Their coloration in light, pastel tones, typical of certain gemstones, confirms that seashells have been replaced with small, polished gemstones in pastel hues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ocean depicted as a wave pattern etched into a frosted glass slab rather than flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not clearly represent a visible ocean or water body. Instead, it seems to be more of an abstract or non-water background given the context of the crystal castle. The ocean is not depicted as a part of a cohesive scene with waves etched into glass. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that the ocean is not a key element present in this image as described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a minimalist gallery display case with clean edges and neutral surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a structure placed inside what appears to be a display case with defined, clean lines. This setting is typical in galleries for displaying art pieces, including the nature of the table the structure is on, which has a minimalistic and neutral-toned appearance. This setup suggests that the entire scene is enclosed within a minimalist gallery display case.",
