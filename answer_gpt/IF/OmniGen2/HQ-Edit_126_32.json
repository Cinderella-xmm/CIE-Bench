      "question": "Does the tree appear as a fantastical, sentient entity with an otherworldly presence rather than a natural tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree has been altered to include elements that are not typically found in nature, such as bright glowing lights, detailed decorative patterns on the trunk, and large, wing-like structures. These features collectively create an image of a tree that resembles a fantastical or sentient entity rather than a common tree as seen in nature, where trees usually have organic, non-glowing features and simple bark textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree's leaves replaced with glowing, fern-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree's leaves have been altered. They appear as large, bright green fern-like structures that glow with a luminescent quality. This transformation from traditional leaves to stylized, glowing fern-like structures suggests a departure from natural to an artistic, otherworldly design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the tree’s bark display detailed silver-colored tribal or ornamental patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trunk of the tree in Image B is depicted with intricate, silver-colored patterns that resemble tribal or ornamental designs. Such patterns are artistically placed and do not occur naturally on tree barks, which typically have rough or smooth, non-patterned appearances. These artistic additions suggest a designed or enchanted tree rather than a natural one.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the tree’s canopy transformed into wing-shaped, translucent, and shimmering structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the canopy of the tree has been artistically transformed into structures that resemble large, translucent, and shimmering wings. This is a stark contrast to traditional tree canopies, which possess a more solid, leafy composition. The wing-like appearance adds to the otherworldly and fantastical nature of the tree.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the tree’s trunk replaced by a structure made of twisted, glass-like fibers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trunk in Image B appears to have a smooth, detailed appearance with tribal-like patterns. There are no clear indications of it being composed of twisted, glass-like fibers, which would suggest a transparent or reflective quality. Instead, it maintains a solid and artistic, but not glass-like, form.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there luminous, vine-shaped tendrils emerging from the base of the tree and extending into the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, bright green, ribbon-like lights wrap around the trunk and suggest an extension into the ground. These can be interpreted as vine-shaped tendrils that are luminous, emerging from the tree and interacting with the environment, consistent with a fantastical depiction of the tree.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the glowing tendrils visually blend or harmonize with the surrounding field through color, light, or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing green tendrils in Image B contrast starkly with the dark background and the vivid blue wings, but they do not appear visually blended or harmonized with the surrounding field in terms of color and texture. The luminescent tendrils stand out distinctly against the darker night setting of the environment.",
