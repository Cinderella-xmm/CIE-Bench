      "question": "Is the title \"The Nocturnal Observer's Guide\" clearly displayed on the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the bottom section, there is a distinct title featuring bold text: 'The nocttulunal Observer's Guide.' This suggests the intention was to have the title 'The Nocturnal Observer's Guide,' but it appears as a typographical error with 'nocttulunal.' Despite the error, the intended clarity in titling is present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the tree and surrounding foliage display lush, highly detailed botanical features consistent with a scientific illustration style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes several leaves and branches depicted with varying shades, outlines, and shadowing, suggesting depth and dimension. However, the illustrations lack the fine detail and precision typical of scientific illustrations, offering more of a stylistic rather than a scientifically accurate representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image dominated by earthy tones, particularly highlighting the owl’s brown and cream plumage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl indeed showcases brown and cream plumage, which are typical earthy tones. These colors are prominent throughout the image, balancing well with the dark blue of the background and the light yellows of the leaves. Thus, the colors are dominated by earthy tones.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible labels pointing to and identifying the owl’s talons and feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features various labels with lines extending from them toward the owl. However, the text accompanying these labels appears nonsensical and not clearly identifying parts such as talons or feathers. Despite the presence of labels, they do not fulfill the function of identification as would be expected.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the moon depicted as a dotted diagram with labeled lunar phases (e.g., waxing gibbous, full moon)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is encircled by dots, creating a diagram-like appearance. There are words surrounding it, but they do not correspond to labeled lunar phases. The moon is depicted in a diagram style with elements suggesting labels, yet lacking clear naming of phases.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a text box located at the bottom of the image containing a short, descriptive paragraph about owl nocturnal adaptations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of Image B, there is a text box that includes a paragraph. Despite the paragraph consisting of scrambled or nonsensical text, the presence of the paragraph ostensibly serves the intended function of describing owl adaptations, albeit unsuccessfully due to the text quality.",
