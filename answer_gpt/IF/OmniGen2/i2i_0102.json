      "question": "Is the word “Draft” written in a handwritten font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' appears to be written in a font that imitates handwriting. The letters are uneven in size and shape, which is typical of handwritten fonts. Handwritten fonts often appear informal and personal. Analyzing the curves and unique features of each letter confirms that the font used resembles handwriting. Even without Image A for comparison, the visual cues indicating uneven spacing and unique letter forms suggest it's a handwritten style.",

      "question": "Is the word “Draft” placed on the yellow paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stack of yellow paper placed on a desk, and the word 'Draft' is clearly positioned on top of this yellow paper. The alignment of the word with the visible boundaries of the yellow paper supports this observation, indicating consistent placement. Using world knowledge, it's typical for text to be placed directly on the paper as part of its intended message or theme. Therefore, even without needing to compare with Image A, it is clear that 'Draft' is indeed placed on the yellow paper.",

      "question": "Does the image resemble a design sketch cover focused on presenting the word “Draft”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central focus is on the word 'Draft' prominently displayed on the yellow paper, with minimal distractions surrounding it, like the corner of a laptop. This setup is reminiscent of a design sketch cover where the main text or theme is highlighted for conceptualization. Typically, design sketches emphasize key elements, often using simple yet effective visual layouts. The clarity of the word 'Draft' and its central placement on the simple background suggests this intention, without requiring comparison with Image A to reach this conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the word “Draft” clearly visible and legible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' is displayed prominently in bold, dark letters on a light, yellow background, which provides excellent contrast and visibility. This visual arrangement ensures that the word 'Draft' is easily recognizable and readable. Such visibility is typical when clarity is prioritized, especially when a text conveys significant information. Therefore, combining world knowledge with the image cues suggests that the word 'Draft' is indeed clearly visible and legible without needing a comparison with Image A.",

      "question": "Are there any elements in the image other than the yellow paper and the word “Draft”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B includes other elements aside from the yellow paper and the word 'Draft'. Notably, part of a laptop is visible on the desk where the yellow paper is placed. These are common objects found in typical office or desk setups. Even without Image A's context, these elements contribute to understanding the environment where the yellow paper and 'Draft' are situated.",
