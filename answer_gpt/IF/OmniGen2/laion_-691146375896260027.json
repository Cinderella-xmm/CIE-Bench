      "question": "Is the entire dresser constructed from LEGO bricks, primarily in brown and gold colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dresser clearly constructed from LEGO bricks. The overall structure and surface display visible LEGO brick textures, and the colors used are predominantly brown and gold. The assumption that LEGO bricks are used is supported by the visible studs and blocky appearance typical of LEGO construction. Thus, the conclusion is based on the combination of visible LEGO features and color differences.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the decorative patterns on the front of the dresser recreated using small interlocking LEGO pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative patterns on the dresser are represented by pieces that maintain the ornamental design. These patterns appear to be made from LEGO bricks, as indicated by the blocky texture and the fact they follow the dresser’s design. Based on the visual cues of LEGO textures and the consistent pattern style with LEGO construction, it can be reasoned that they are made with LEGO pieces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the curved sides and legs of the dresser constructed using smoothly joined sloped LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The curved sides and legs of the dresser in Image B have a smooth appearance consistent with sloped LEGO bricks. The continuous curve and the seamless transition imply that the LEGO bricks are used creatively to mimic curved surfaces. Accordingly, based on the visual cues of LEGO construction techniques and the smooth texture, it is concluded that the parts are made using sloped LEGO bricks.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the marble top been replaced with gray flat LEGO tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the top of the dresser as gray, with visible patterns of LEGO studs, which indicates usage of LEGO tiles replacing the original marble texture. This is evident through the typical LEGO surface texture and stud arrangement, suggesting a change from marble to LEGO tiles.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dresser placed on a neutral, plain background that does not distract from the LEGO structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a plain white, which serves as a neutral backdrop. This choice prevents distractions from the main subject—the LEGO dresser—maintaining focus on its unique construction. The interaction between the subject and background is considered neutral, supporting clarity of the dresser’s features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the LEGO dresser maintain the original two-drawer layout with ornate frame designs around each drawer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dresser showcases a design that clearly features two drawers and ornate frame designs around them. The layout and design reflect the original dresser's style, suggesting the LEGO version mirrors these aspects. Visual comparison of layout and decoration confirms the replication of two drawers with similar ornate frames.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all surfaces of the dresser visibly composed of LEGO bricks, with no realistic wood or metal textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based solely on Image B, all visible surfaces of the dresser are made from LEGO bricks. The textures and appearance are unmistakably LEGO, with the absence of realistic wood or metal textures. This conclusion is drawn from the consistent brick textures seen across the dresser’s surfaces, confirming full composition from LEGO.",
