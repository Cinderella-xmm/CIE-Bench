        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure exhibits characteristics of a sculpture – it is a monochromatic white and appears to have the solidity typical of stone, lacking the soft textures and colors indicative of a living person. These visual cues suggest the ballerina is a sculpture.",
