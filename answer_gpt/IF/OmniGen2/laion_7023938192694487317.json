      "question": "Is the individual's torso and attire rendered as an oversized figurine with exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate that the body and attire are modeled in a way that resembles a figurine rather than a human form. The arms and torso have a distinct simplicity and exaggeration in size and shape, typical of figurines, possibly aiming to create a stylized or cartoon-like effect. This is contrastive to a normal human posture as depicted in figurines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figurine wear a stylized athletic jersey that differs from the original realistic shirt design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the attire appears to be part of the figurine design, exhibiting a more stylized and uniform appearance than typical fabric. The way it's presented is sleek and consistent, lacking the natural folds, wrinkles, and texture of clothing seen in real-life fabrics, suggesting itâ€™s a stylized design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the \"Craft\" logo visibly emphasized with increased size, brightness, or contrast compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Craft' logo is prominently displayed with clear and bold lettering, contributing to its increased visibility compared to Image A. This emphasis is common in stylized representations where branding elements are highlighted for visual impact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the shirt material rendered with a matte-finished black polymer appearance, lacking shine or fabric-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shirt in Image B exhibits a smooth, consistent, and non-reflective surface typical of polymer materials without fabric-like nuances such as shine or texture. This is consistent with how plastics or matte surfaces appear.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors in the logo rendered in elevated, bold tones (e.g., bright red, white, blue) that contrast sharply with the black shirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the logo appear vivid and pronounced, creating a stark contrast with the black background of the shirt. This elevates the color tones to be bold, ensuring they stand out distinctly against their dark setting.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a stand beneath the figurine that has a sleek design consistent with polished metal bases typically used in collectible figures or displays. This base is a clear departure from what would be a natural human stance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the base exhibit a subtle reflection consistent with polished metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base shows visual cues of a reflective surface, which aligns with the characteristics of polished metal. This subtle reflection gives it the appearance of being metallic and sleek.",
