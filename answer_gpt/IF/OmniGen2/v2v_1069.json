      "question": "Is the ceiling fan enclosed within a transparent snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembling a ceiling fan is indeed contained within a glass-like dome, which appears to be a snow globe. This is evident from the shape of the dome, which is characteristic of a snow globe, and the presence of snow-like material at the base inside the dome.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe rest atop a tabletop under soft lighting with a warm and minimalist background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe is placed on a wooden surface, indicative of a tabletop. The lighting in the scene is warm, as suggested by the yellow-orange hue in the background and the gentle glow illuminating the snow globe. The background is plain with a warm color tone, contributing to a minimalist setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there delicate shimmering effects visible on nearby surfaces caused by light passing through the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible shimmering effects on nearby surfaces as the lighting is soft and warm but does not create shimmering or reflective patterns on the surfaces outside of the snow globe. The focus is on the snow globe itself, and the surrounding areas appear evenly lit without additional light effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the fan inside the snow globe depicted in a playful, cartoon-style 3D design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fan inside the snow globe in Image B is depicted in a realistic 3D style rather than a cartoonish one. The details and finish of the fan's blades and motor are indicative of a realistic design, typical of traditional ceiling fans, rather than a playful and exaggerated cartoon-style rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are snowflakes visible drifting gently through the air inside the tiny room within the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible snowflake patterns inside the globe. These snowflakes are artistically rendered and distributed around the fan, giving the appearance of being suspended in the air within the snow globe. This simulates the classic snow globe effect of snowflakes drifting gently.",
