    "Question": "Q1: Is the word 'warm' placed at the top left corner in large letters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'warm' is prominently displayed near the top center of the wall art, spanning horizontally across the artwork. The large size of the font makes the word stand out considerably against the background. By typical placement standards, it could be considered centrally located rather than strictly at the top left corner, suggesting a slight misalignment with the question. Therefore, the placement is not strictly as described in the top left corner.",
