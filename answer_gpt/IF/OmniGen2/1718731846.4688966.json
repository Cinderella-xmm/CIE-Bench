      "question": "Does the figurine appear to be made of polished wood, with visible wood grain and a smooth, reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine indeed has characteristics that suggest it might be crafted from a material with a polished surface, such as its glossy appearance and the smoothness of its contours. However, upon closer inspection, the absence of visible wood grain indicates that it doesn't fit the typical appearance of polished wood with visible grain. The reflection and smooth surface may result from a different material or finish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black and white areas of the dog's fur represented using contrasting natural wood tones (dark vs. light)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur of the figurine is shown in distinct black and white colors. While these colors provide visual contrast, they do not mimic natural wood tones. True natural wood tones would include more nuanced shades, resembling actual wood coloration. The simplicity of black and white suggests a design choice rather than an attempt to represent natural wood tones.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the figurineâ€™s contours appear smooth and rounded, avoiding sharp or angular edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B displays very smooth and rounded contours. The overall design emphasizes a soft, curved aesthetic without any noticeable sharp or angular edges. This contributes to the figurine's cartoon-like, playful appearance, often characterized by softened shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are facial features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth enhanced with visible fine carved lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the figurine, like the eyes, nose, and mouth, are visually distinct and prominent. However, they do not appear to be enhanced by fine carved lines. Instead, the features are defined by their shape and shading, likely painted or embossed rather than carved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figurine placed on a minimalist wooden platform that matches the carving style and material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figurine sitting on a wooden platform that is simple and unadorned. The platform looks wooden, given its texture and color, which fits well with the overall smooth stylistic theme of the figurine. It appears to be designed to complement the figurine without drawing attention away from it.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image emphasize craftsmanship through natural wood textures, subtle lighting, and a muted color palette compared to the original bright appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is indeed subtle and the color palette is relatively muted, compared to brighter tones that might be used otherwise. The shadows and highlights emphasize the craftsmanship of the design, but the absence of natural wood textures suggests that the emphasis is more on the design and style rather than the use of natural wood materials.",
