    "Question": "Q1: Is the title “Astronaut and Space Station Dynamics” present in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the title reads 'ASTRONTN AND SPACE DYNAMICS', which closely resembles 'Astronaut and Space Dynamics', but it does not include 'Space Station Dynamics'. The title is different due to these misspellings or intentional alterations, so it does not fully match 'Astronaut and Space Station Dynamics'. Therefore, the correct option is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the astronaut, Moon, and ISS depicted using simplified, vector-style shapes rather than photorealistic rendering?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates the astronaut, Moon, and space elements using simplified, vector-style graphic designs, evident in the flat colors and lack of detailed texture or shadows. Common infographic style, often utilizes simplified and stylized shapes for clarity rather than photorealistic rendering. Thus, the correct choice reflecting this vector style is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the spacesuit include visible textural details such as stitching or fabric patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spacesuit is depicted with flat areas of color typical of vector graphics and lacks visible textural details such as stitching or fabric patterns. Simplified graphics generally omit such details for a clean look, unlike in photorealistic images. The absence of these details means the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are gold accents used in the image to emphasize certain elements such as labels, borders, or arrows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, gold accents are present in various elements such as shields and numbers, which are used to emphasize and highlight key parts of the infographic.

    "Question": "Q5: Are there three sequential stages illustrated with arrows showing the astronaut's movement toward or interaction with the space station?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the infographic visually displays several stages and arrows; however, they do not depict the astronaut's movement toward or interaction with the space station directly. These arrows and steps appear to be part of abstract or technical processes rather than a clear depiction of sequential movement. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the labels “Step 1: Prepare”, “Step 2: Navigate”, and “Step 3: Operate” displayed in sequence along the bottom of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the labels contain noticeable typos and order issues, such as 'Step 1: Navpare', 'Step 2: Navigate', and 'Step 3: Operate', and the term 'Prepare' appears anomalously. This sequence does not match the specific preparation, navigation, and operation steps in sequence as described. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the entire infographic arranged in a vertical format with elements stacked from top to bottom?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents an infographic format where many elements are arranged in columns and rows, not strictly stacked vertically from top to bottom. The layout is more horizontal with side-by-side comparisons of steps and procedures. Therefore, the arrangement is not purely vertical, which means the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
