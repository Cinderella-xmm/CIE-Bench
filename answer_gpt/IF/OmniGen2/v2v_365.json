      "question": "Does the character retain the original shell structure and turtle attributes, reimagined in a cute, chibi-style design with long legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a character that resembles a turtle in a chibi or cartoon style, maintaining attributes like a turtle-like face and feet, but the shell is used more as an aesthetic accessory rather than for physical protection. The character design deviates from realistic proportions, and does not have notably long legs typical of chibi-style figures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image B maintains a layout that seems consistent with a portrait orientation, including a title 'OOTD' at the top. The main chibi character is situated on the left, while individual clothing pieces and accessories are organized on the right. This cohesion lends itself to a possible 9:16 aspect ratio.",
