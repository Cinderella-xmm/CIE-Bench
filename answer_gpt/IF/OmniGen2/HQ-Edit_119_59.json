      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms of the weightlifter are notably oversized and exaggerated, reflecting a cartoon-like style.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of Image B, there is a strip which incorporates grid lines and resembles a calendar layout design with space for writing or labeling, suggesting it might be intended as a detachable calendar element.
