    "Question": "Q2: Is the packaging box rendered in an isometric perspective?",
    "explanation": "The image of the packaging box in Image B is shown with both the front and side visible to the viewer, which gives a sense of depth and three-dimensionality typical of isometric perspective rendering, providing a more comprehensive view of the packaging.

    "Question": "Q3: Is the text 'DUAL TRANSFORMER HEROES' visible on the packaging box?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visible text on the packaging box is 'DUAL HERS' and 'DUJAL TRANSFORES,' not the phrase 'DUAL TRANSFORMER HEROES.'
