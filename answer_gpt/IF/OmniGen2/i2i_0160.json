        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is now a dark sky filled with stars, indicating it is a night scene. The presence of stars and a dark blue color suggests a night sky, contrasting the warm, bright sunset background of Image A. The visual change from a sunset to a night sky is evident. Therefore, the background has been changed from a sunset to a starry night sky.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a crescent moon is visible in the night sky, which was not present in Image A. This crescent moon adds to the night time ambiance and matches the starry sky background. The presence of this moon indicates the addition of a new element in the night sky.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits soft lighting that highlights the birds against the night sky. This subtle glow, paired with the serene starry background, can give the image a dreamy, tranquil quality.

      "explanation": "The positions and details of the birds in Image B are consistent with those in Image A.
