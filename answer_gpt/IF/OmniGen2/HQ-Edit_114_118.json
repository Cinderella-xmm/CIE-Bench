      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible curved glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a ship enclosed in a glass dome with clear boundaries, which is evident from the visible curvature and reflections on its surface. The dome's shape and transparency suggest it encases the scene entirely. Therefore, based on these visual cues, the answer is yes.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sails depicted with visible creases, layered edges, and shadows consistent with a papercraft material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sails in Image B appear to have a flat, smooth surface with evenly layered edges, lacking depth or texture indicative of fabric. These characteristics are consistent with papercraft, where materials are typically more rigid and can hold defined shapes like creases and shadows. Thus, the answer is yes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a translucent, shimmering blue resin layer beneath the ship that mimics ocean waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the ship, there is a distinctly visible blue layer with a wavy texture that reflects light in a way reminiscent of water. The transparency and shine suggest it is resin, commonly used in crafts to simulate water. Hence, the answer is yes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the seagulls suspended by fine, barely visible wires, giving them a static yet dynamic floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seagulls in Image B appear to float in a stable position around the ship. Although there is no clear visual of wires, their positioning suggests suspension which can be achieved using thin, almost invisible wires for display purposes. Therefore, the answer is yes, based on their appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the ship retain its original structural details such as masts, rigging, and hull design, now presented in miniature scale within the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the ship in a scaled-down form within the glass dome. The structural elements such as masts, rigging, and hull are clearly visible, retaining their design but adjusted to fit the smaller scale. The intricate details, though reduced in size, are preserved. Thus, the answer is yes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the blue resin layer exhibit shimmering surface textures and light reflections that simulate flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue resin layer in Image B has a surface texture that reflects and refracts light, mimicking the appearance of flowing water with shimmering effects. This characteristic is similar to the way water interacts with light. Therefore, the answer is yes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the curved glass dome visibly present with clear boundaries and possible light refraction effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the curved glass dome is clearly visible, with defined edges and a surface that bends light, indicative of light refraction typical of glass objects. This observation confirms the presence of the glass dome along with its effects. Thus, the answer is yes.",
