        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette is an unconventional combination of neon pink and blue, which are commonly associated with a cyberpunk aesthetic.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keyboard is visually lit by vibrant blue and purple lights. These colors, particularly when used in glowing neon forms, are typical in creating a cyberpunk atmosphere. The strong hue and intensity of these colors strongly suggest that the keyboard emits blue-purple neon light.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fingertips are illuminated and show a soft glow effect, primarily from the reflection of the neon lights on the keyboard. The presence of such glow, which diffuses slightly around the fingertips, indicates a subtle, soft light effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a dark background contrasted with glowing neon lights, a hallmark of cyberpunk visuals. The combination of blue and pink neon lights accentuates this theme, making the lighting consistent with the cyberpunk style, which is often characterized by such bright, glowing elements against dark scenes.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing the entirety of Image B, all visible components consistently display neon lighting and a dark environment, without any elements that detract from the cyberpunk or futuristic illusion. The hands, keyboard, and background all contribute synergistically to the style, as no contradictory objects or lighting are present.",
