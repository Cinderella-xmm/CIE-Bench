      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragonfly is visually transformed with characteristics not typically found in regular insects.

These artistic and fantasy elements, combined with vibrant, unnatural blue hues and patterns, suggest a transformation into a non-realistic being.",
