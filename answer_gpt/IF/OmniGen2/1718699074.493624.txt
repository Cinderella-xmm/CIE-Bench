    "Question": "Q1: Has the central structure been replaced with a digital billboard featuring luminous panels?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure appears to have been transformed to emit a bright blue glow, suggestive of a digital billboard or similar digital display with luminous panels. This change contrasts with the concrete appearance in Image A, which lacks such luminous characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible dynamic neon animations on the digital billboard surface?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a luminous transformation with visible neon-like hues, but there is no specific indication of dynamic animations present. While the surface is vibrant and glowing, it lacks any discernible movement or animation elements; hence it doesn't showcase dynamic animations.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Has the natural overgrowth been replaced with synthetic, glowing foliage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the overgrowth appears to emit a bright green glow, which is not present in the natural foliage seen in Image A. This suggests that the foliage in Image B has unnatural, synthetic qualities that produce an artificial glow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the original architectural angles and structural geometry preserved in the transformed structure?",
    "explanation": "Both images share the same fundamental design and geometry for the central structure, with distinct shapes and angles remaining consistent, indicating that the original architectural angles and structural geometry have been preserved even with the vibrant color enhancements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Do the surrounding buildings feature metallic facades and visible augmented reality elements such as holograms or digital overlays?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding buildings do not appear to have metallic facades or visible augmented reality elements. The buildings retain their original material appearance similar to Image A, with no evident holograms or digital overlays.",
    "answer": "No"
