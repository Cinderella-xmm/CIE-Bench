      "question": "Has the vase been replaced with a structure composed entirely of flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the only visible structure is the floral arrangement in a pot. There is no sign of a vase, as seen in Image A, where an intricately designed metallic vase is present. The absence of the vase in Image B suggests that it has been replaced with just flowers and a pot. Using visual cues and knowledge of typical vase-viewing, it can be concluded that the vase is missing.",

      "question": "Do the floral details follow and blend with the contours of the vase's original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B solely showcases a bouquet arranged in a pot, without any visible vessels or contour resembling the vase's structure seen in Image A. The flowers are in a consistent and typical floral arrangement pattern rather than following any external contour akin to the vase's shape in Image A. This indicates that the flowers do not blend with nor follow the contours of any vase shape.",

      "question": "Does the design prioritize artistic and imaginative expression over functional realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an arrangement of bright red flowers in a pot is highlighted, creating an artistic and visually appealing portrait. The absence of a vase and focus on the floral design implies imaginative expression. Comparing to Image A, where the vase serves a clear functional purpose, it seems the design in Image B is more artistic rather than focusing on realism. This aligns with artistic creativity over practical use.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the final design present a unique and innovative interpretation rather than a conventional vase appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a traditional vase, but rather features a pot with flowers. This is a departure from the conventional vase presentation seen in Image A. The floral arrangement itself provides an unusual display not bound by standard vase structure, indicating a unique and innovative take. Given the absent vase, this arrangement strikes as unconventional, diverging from typical visual expectations of vase designs.",

      "question": "Does the transformed vase retain the original shape and structure while being composed of flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit any sign of retaining the vase's shape or structure, as Image A does. The image focuses on a pot with a floral arrangement, and no resemblance to the intricately patterned or shaped vase from Image A is visible. The reliance on a different structure (the pot) and the absence of the vase's unique form in Image B indicate non-retention of its original shape and structure.",
