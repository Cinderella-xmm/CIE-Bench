      "question": "Does the edited image depict elements from extreme sports?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays text that reads 'Executive Sports Seriee,' suggesting an association with sports. The presence of a person in a dynamic pose with sports attire (sneakers, joggers) additionally supports the theme of extreme sports. This attire and wording typically relate to active and intense physical activities, which aligns with the concept of extreme sports.",

      "question": "Is the person in the edited image shown in a jumping pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a figure with arms bent and raised slightly and legs in a spread manner, suggesting a jumping motion. The position of the feet off the ground and the dynamic pose further reinforce the interpretation that the person is depicted mid-jump.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of thick lines and shading around the figure and text in Image B suggests a hand-drawn or illustrated style. These bold outlines typically characterize sketch-like or graphic art designs.",

      "question": "Are abstract graffiti elements visible within the background of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features abstract, splatter-like and starburst elements behind the text and figure, which are frequently used in graffiti art. These elements are not straightforward or representational, which characterizes the abstract nature of graffiti. The combined presence of text and graphic stylings suggest graffiti influences.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B consists mainly of abstract and graphic elements without any indication of a concrete or gritty texture. Typically, a concrete texture would include patterns or shading that imitate rough, urban surfaces, which is not present in this image.",
