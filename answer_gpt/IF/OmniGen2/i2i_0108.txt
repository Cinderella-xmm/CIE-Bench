    "Question": "Q2: Does the character appear to be breaking out from a television screen?",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the character in a defensive shield-raising pose?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the character is holding a shield with one hand to the side and raised slightly, with the other hand in a fist.
