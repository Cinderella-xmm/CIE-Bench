      "question": "Is the central body of the drone redesigned to resemble a robotic face with sharp, angular features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central body of the drone is depicted with a design that has sharp, angular features that resemble a robotic face. This is evident from the visual cues such as the shape of the front and the lines on the body suggesting a mechanical visage.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the rotor blades replaced with arm-like structures that appear to be capable of rotation and are positioned as if in motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rotor blades remain intact as typical drone propellers. They are not replaced with arm-like structures; rather, they continue to serve their function as rotors, indicating that the statement of replacement is incorrect.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original landing gears replaced with multiple spider-like mechanical legs extending from the drone’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landing gears of the drone appear as part of a creative comic-style depiction but they do not resemble multiple spider-like mechanical legs. Instead, they are simplified to fit the cartoonish style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the character shown in mid-flight above a detailed futuristic cityscape with high-rise buildings and advanced urban elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts a drone in mid-flight above a cityscape with tall futuristic buildings, contributing to a notion of an advanced urban environment. The visual style suggests a themed futuristic setting with high-rise elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character exhibit a sleek metallic surface with reflective textures, chrome finishes, or glowing highlights indicating a metallic aura?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drone character is drawn with slick, smooth surfaces and stylized highlights that give an impression of a metallic texture, common in futuristic design depictions. However, the image is stylized rather than photorealistic, so while it suggests metal, it does not visually confirm chrome finishes or genuine reflective textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a speech bubble present with the text “Secure the Quantum Core!” written in a bold, tech-style font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a speech bubble with text reading “Secure the Core!! Quannthum Core!!” in a bold manner typical of comic or tech-style illustrations. However, the text differs slightly as 'Secure the Quannthum Core' is not fully mentioned, instead, the speech is broken into parts.",
