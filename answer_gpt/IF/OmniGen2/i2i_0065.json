        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image depicts a dog's sculpture placed inside a glass display case with lighting on top, which is common in museum settings to showcase artifacts or exhibits.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show the dog's sculpture enclosed in a transparent structure. The presence of glass panels and lighting above it bears resemblance to typical museum exhibit cases. This observation allows the conclusion that the dog is presented inside a glass display case.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the lighting from the display case seems to illuminate the entire sculpture, but concentrates more towards the top half, including the face area. This focused lighting on the dog's face enhances its visibility, which is common in display lighting to emphasize key features of the exhibit.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is visible text within the glass display case. It suggests information about the exhibit, potentially including details about the dog's breed and a story title. This is typical in museums where exhibits are accompanied by descriptions or labels for visitor information.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, Image A depicts a real dog with specific features like posture and expression. Image B showcases a sculpture of the dog, which replicates the posture and general appearance as seen originally, such as the tilted head and facial expression, maintaining the original stance.",
