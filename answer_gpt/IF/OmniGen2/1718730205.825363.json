      "question": "Is the entire image, including the cosmic vortex and forest landscape, rendered in the style of a stained glass window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire image features a pattern consistent with stained glass. The image is segmented into various sections separated by lines that resemble lead cames commonly used in stained glass windows. The cosmic vortex and the landscape below exhibit this segmented and outlined patterning typical of stained glass art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the spiral patterns of the cosmic vortex outlined with thick, dark, continuous lines resembling lead cames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spiral patterns in the cosmic vortex indeed have outlines with thick, dark lines that resemble lead cames, typically used in stained glass art to separate different colored glass pieces. This style is crucial in stained glass art for structural integrity and visual effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sky and tree canopies depicted using deep, saturated colors such as deep blues, purples, reds, and greens characteristic of jewel tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palette used for the sky and tree canopies includes deep and saturated colors. The colors are vibrant and rich, aligning with jewel tones like deep blues, oranges, and greens, which are common in stained glass art to mimic the appearance of precious stones.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the stained glass elements (including the spiral and trees) exhibit angular, multi-faceted textures that simulate light refraction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the stained glass elements lack angular, multi-faceted textures. Instead, they are portrayed with smooth color transitions and don't have the textured surface that would suggest light refraction typical of cut or faceted glass.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image feature soft, glowing light effects, smooth color transitions, and balanced composition that evoke a sense of calm and serenity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of smooth color transitions, coupled with the artful composition and vibrant colors, results in an artwork that evokes a sense of calm and serenity. The glowing effects from the stained glass simulate light passing through, contributing to a soft ambiance.",
