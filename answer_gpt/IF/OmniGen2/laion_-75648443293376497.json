      "question": "Has the backpack's fabric been replaced with a visible rugged leather texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric of the backpack appears smooth and consistent with a canvas-like texture, similar to what is observed in Image A, rather than a rugged leather texture. Leather typically has a distinct texture, including grain patterns or a sheen that is not present here.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buckles have an antique brass color, which differs from the metallic silver color of the buckles in Image A. Brass has a warm, yellowish hue, which is visibly different from the cooler, reflective silver.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'EXPLORE VINTAGE' is prominently displayed on the front flap of the backpack, clearly visible and distinct, which was not present in Image A. This indicates an intentional design feature on the edited image.",
