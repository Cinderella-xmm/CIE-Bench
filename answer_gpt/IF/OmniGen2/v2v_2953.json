      "question": "Does the cocktail glass appear to be sculpted from clay with visible texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cocktail glass exhibits a smooth surface, lacking the typical sculpted clay texture such as fingerprints, rough patches, or subtle irregularities often associated with clay creations. However, its appearance is more consistent with a stylized, digitally rendered design rather than hand-sculpted clay. The absence of clay-like imperfections leads to the conclusion that it does not appear to be sculpted from clay.",

      "question": "Are the ice cubes and lime slice depicted with intricate clay textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ice cubes are depicted with a uniform, grid-like pattern rather than the varied and irregular surface one would expect from sculpted clay. Similarly, the lime slice maintains a smooth, distinctly separated look from the rest of the glass, more reminiscent of a digital rendering than a hand-crafted clay object. Therefore, they do not exhibit the intricate textures typical of clay.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the surroundings, including the bar and bottles, exhibit a handcrafted clay appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bar and bottles possess a simplified and stylized look, lacking the slight variations, layering, and imperfections typical of handcrafted clay objects. They appear uniformly colored and symmetrical, which is more characteristic of digital or manufactured items rather than clay creations.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall composition maintain an organic, imperfect look characteristic of hand-sculpted clay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall aesthetic in Image B is uniform and polished, lacking the organic, slightly uneven quality that hand-sculpted clay objects display. The elements in the image, such as the glass, ice cubes, and surrounding environment, appear to be digitally rendered with smooth, clean lines and uniform colors, indicative of a well-defined, structured appearance rather than an organic, imperfect one.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting and shading adjusted to enhance the clay-like textures and three-dimensional appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates lighting and shading that emphasizes the smooth, clean lines of the digital art style rather than enhancing any kind of clay-like texture. The reflections, shadows, and overall lighting are consistent with a digital rendering, focusing on clarity and clean depiction of shapes, rather than highlighting the intricate, varied surface details or imperfections typical of clay objects.",
