      "question": "Does the edited image depict the chocolate cake as an anthropomorphic cake girl with the luscious chocolate glaze and layered design intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left panel directly displays the chocolate cake slice as it is, not transformed into an anthropomorphic character. The right panel features a manga-style character resembling a cake girl based on context, with no explicit transformation of the cake into a human form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "In Panel 1, is the cake girl depicted as sad and tearful, resting a hand on her cheek, with the text box containing the specified dialogue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The left panel in Image B shows only the chocolate cake with a speech bubble but not the cake girl herself. Therefore, there is no depiction of a sad, tearful cake girl. The speech bubble humorously implies personification, but visually, it's just the cake.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "In Panel 2, is the cake girl depicted as determined, gripping a spoon like a weapon, with chocolate spirals and sparkling effects surrounding her?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the right panel of Image B, the character appears determined, fitting the energetic and lively manga style, but she is not depicted holding a spoon as a weapon, nor are there any chocolate spirals surrounding her. The character is surrounded by dessert items with a thoughtful expression instead.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the text boxes in both panels written in a playful, casual handwritten font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text boxes in Image B use a comic-style handwritten font, which is indeed playful and casual. This is evident from the fun, informal appearance of the text, fitting within a manga-style theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the edited image presented in a vertical, two-panel manga format with an aspect ratio of 2:3, featuring a vibrant and energetic, fun and exaggerated cartoony aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of Image B shows two panels vertically stacked, resembling a manga format. The style uses bright colors, expressive characters, and exaggerated elements typical of a fun, energetic cartoon or manga aesthetic, although the specific aspect ratio determination is more assumption than directly measured.",
