      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the motorcycle been transformed into a collectible-style figure with simplified or stylized proportions suitable for display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle retains its realistic design and proportions, similar to Image A. The detailed features and metallic finishes are consistent with real motorcycles, indicating that it has not been transformed into a simplified or stylized collectible figure suitable for display as would be characteristic of figurines or models designed for collection purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the collectible figure placed inside a box rendered in isometric projection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two boxes beside the motorcycle: one with the text 'FUTRE RIDER' and an illustration of a figure, and the other with what appears to be a futuristic vehicle. These boxes are rendered with a perspective visible on both sides, suggesting that they are not shown in isometric projection, which typically involves equal dimensions without perspective distortion.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the motorcycle feature glowing neon accents, hover wheels, and a visible digital interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle maintains its traditional appearance without glowing neon accents, hover wheels, or visible digital interfaces. The wheels are regular motorcycle wheels with tires, and there are no signs of futuristic modifications like hover capabilities or neon lights, similar to Image A.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text \"FUTURE RIDER\" clearly visible and correctly spelled on the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a large box with the text 'FUTRE RIDER,' which is spelled incorrectly according to common spelling conventions. The correct spelling should be 'FUTURE RIDER,' but the text on the box omits the 'U' in FUTURE.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box with the text 'FUTRE RIDER' has a transparent section that showcases a figure inside, visible through the window. This transparency is typical for displaying products while still inside their packaging, allowing customers to view the item without opening the box.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a second depiction of the motorcycle next to the box that displays ultra-realistic textures and metallic finishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a box with a depiction of a futuristic vehicle, featuring glowing blue accents and stylized design, which differs significantly from the ultra-realistic motorcycle next to it. The motorcycle itself retains its realistic textures and metallic finishes, but the vehicle on the box is not a second depiction of the motorcycle but rather another item entirely.",
