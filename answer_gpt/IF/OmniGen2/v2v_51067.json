      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the van exhibits two distinct color sections: the upper part of the van is painted in a light cream or white color, while the lower part is painted in a vibrant teal color. This creates a two-tone design that is very noticeable due to the stark contrast between the two colors. This color scheme is often used to give a retro or vibrant look, combining visual observation with common knowledge about vehicle aesthetics.",

      "question": "Are there shiny chrome accents on the grille and wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are bright, reflective elements located on the front grille of the van, suggesting chrome accents. However, the wheels don't show a shiny chrome finish; they appear more like a standard metallic or matte finish, typical of regular utility van wheels. Thus, while there are chrome accents on the grille, the wheels lack this feature.",

      "question": "Is there a roof rack loaded with colorful surfboards on top of the van?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a roof rack on top of the van, holding two surfboards. The surfboards are distinctly colored, with one being red or orange and the other a shade of green, making them vibrant and noticeable. This aligns with the description of a roof rack loaded with colorful surfboards, a typical choice for surfers or beach-goers, indicating the answer.",

      "question": "Is the image captured in a sunny, slightly desaturated photographic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting seems to be bright, and the colors, especially the teal and white of the van, are vibrant without any visible desaturation. The contrast and colors are bold and saturated, providing a lively appearance, which does not align with a desaturated style usually characterized by muted colors and lower contrast.",

      "question": "Does the van have design elements typical of a vintage surf van from the nineteen seventies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The van in Image B has several elements reminiscent of a 1970s surf van, such as the two-tone paint job and the roof rack with surfboards. The overall aesthetic gives off a retro vibe often associated with surf culture and lifestyle during that era, such as bright colors, and utilitarian design that prioritizes function for beach trips.",
