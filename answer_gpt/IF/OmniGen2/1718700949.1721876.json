      "question": "Is the elephant depicted as a smaller-scale version enclosed within a transparent glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is depicted within a transparent glass display case, which is visually indicated by the surrounding transparent walls and the way the scene is enclosed. World knowledge tells us that objects within such a case are typically smaller-scale versions. This analysis relies on the recognition of the visual cues suggesting confinement within transparent glass.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the intricate armor details on the elephant rendered with a shiny, metallic-resin-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor details on the elephant in Image B appear shiny and have a smooth, reflective surface, resembling resin or metallic textures. This conclusion is drawn from the visual appearance of the armor, combined with common knowledge of materials that exhibit such surface qualities.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there four small golden banners made of silk-like material positioned at each corner of the glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based solely on Image B, there are two visible golden banners made of silk-like material positioned on the top corners of the glass display case. The banners are indicated by their fabric-like appearance and placement. The analysis is guided by the visibility and positioning cues within the image, leading to the conclusion of having two banners rather than four.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background feature multiple layers of mountains with translucent, soft-edged silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of mountain silhouettes which have soft edges, a characteristic often used to depict depth with layers. These silhouettes are translucent, allowing us to conclude that the background indeed contains multiple layers of mountains. This analysis relies on visual information about the mountain appearance in terms of opacity and edge softness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, stylized bonsai-like trees placed along the foreground edges of the display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly features small, stylized bonsai-like trees placed within the glass display case, along the foreground edges. The trees are small and have a distinct shape reminiscent of bonsai, as confirmed by their appearance and positioning within the scene. This conclusion is arrived at by identifying the visual elements that match common characteristics of bonsai trees.",
