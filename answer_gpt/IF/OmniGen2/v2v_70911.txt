    "Question": "Q1: Is the black Axe Spiked Up Look Putty container visibly cracked open?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the container shows what appears to be a three-dimensional effect on its top, resembling a galaxy scene. The presence of a nebula image overlay does not resemble physical damage or a crack. Combining this with common packaging knowledge, the container is not actually physically cracked open but instead digitally edited to appear as if the lid is displaying an image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the container reveal a vibrant miniature nebula inside?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the container features an image that resembles a nebula, characterized by swirling patterns typical of such celestial objects. This overlay on the lid gives the illusion of a nebula being inside the container as part of the edited image's design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Does the nebula contain fiery red and energetic pink hues?",
    "explanation": "The nebula depicted on top of the edited container in Image B appears to contain deep pink hues that are commonly associated with representations of cosmic phenomena.

    "Question": "Q4: Do the nebula's colors match the fiery red and energetic pink hues from the abstract explosive design on the original label?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the label on the container features a mix of fiery red and pinkish tones. Comparing this with the nebula in Image B, the deep pink from the nebula shares a similarity with the energetic pink hues on the original label, thereby matching in theme though not perfectly in exact coloration.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the nebula set against a backdrop of distant stars?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the nebula pattern on top of the container appears to include star-like white dots reminiscent of stars seen in space images. This choice of design suggests a backdrop of stars accompanying the nebula in the edited representation.",
