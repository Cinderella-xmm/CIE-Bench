    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the saxophone transformed into a serpent-like creature with a coiled body and metallic scales?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the saxophone’s body is stylized to simulate serpentine scales, giving it a creature-like appearance closely resembling a dragon or snake, as can be inferred from the metallic texture and scale pattern. This indicates an artistic transformation from a regular saxophone to one with a mythical creature aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original saxophone keys replaced with gemstones that exhibit a shimmering, reflective quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the saxophone keys modified to include at least one gemstone, as evident from the visually distinct reflective and luminous quality typical of gems. This differs from standard saxophone keys which are metallic and not gemstone-like.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the bell of the saxophone been transformed into an open maw featuring sharp, stylized fangs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bell of the saxophone is visible and appears to have been modified, but there are no sharp, stylized fangs or open maw present. The transformation focuses on the texture and form rather than adding such features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the saxophone’s neck extend into a coiled serpent body decorated with delicate filigree patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the saxophone's neck connects seamlessly into a body stylized with scales, suggesting a serpentine form. However, there are no intricate filigree patterns visible; the detail is more focused on the scale-like texture.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the saxophone's mouthpiece without any transformation into a barbed tongue or any fang-like presence. This indicates a focus on surface texture rather than modifying structural elements like the reed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
