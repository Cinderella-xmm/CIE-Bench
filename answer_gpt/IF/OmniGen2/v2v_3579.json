      "question": "Do the sushi pieces form a clear figure of a person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When observing Image B, most of the sushi pieces are arranged in a map-like format similar to the United States, and there's an arm emerging from the northeastern section, which does not form a complete figure of a person. The arrangement still heavily represents the shape of the map without clear human features for a torso, head, or legs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the right arm of the person figure visibly lifted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an orange arm-like object extending from the northeastern region of the sushi map arrangement, clearly positioned upwards, mimicking a raised arm. This is distinct from the sushi map, indicating an added element resembling a lifted arm.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figure include a left arm positioned appropriately on the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show another arm-like structure parallel to the lifted right arm. The sushi arrangement primarily represents a map with only one visible arm-like extension added at the top. Hence, there is no left arm visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both legs of the person figure clearly represented by sushi pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the sushi arrangement in the shape of the US map without additional features resembling legs. The arrangement does not feature modifications or extensions simulating legs in the context of a human figure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head of the person figure represented by sushi pieces and distinguishable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A close inspection reveals that there's no distinctive sushi arrangement resembling a head in Image B. The sushi continues to form the shape of the geographical map of the United States, with only one alteration visible as the raised arm. No separate section is styled or positioned as a human head.",
