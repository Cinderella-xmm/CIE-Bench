    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the silhouetted boat and riders replaced by a mythical ocean guardian creature that is clearly distinguishable from a regular boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central focus is a large, illuminated shell-like structure with vibrant colors drawing attention and diverging from the typical appearance of a boat. This structure does not bear resemblance to a conventional boat, making it appear extraordinary or mythical. In comparison, Image A clearly features a standard motorboat silhouette on water, reinforcing the difference. Based on the visual distinction, the entity in Image B can be perceived as a mythical creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the creature feature a shell-like body composed of sunset-colored hues (orange, red, yellow)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases an object that resembles a shell, but its coloration primarily includes vibrant blue hues, contrasting with the sunset backdrop instead of embodying the typical sunset colors of orange, red, and yellow. Although the sky exhibits these colors, the shell-like entity itself is predominantly blue. Hence, it does not feature a shell-like body composed of sunset colors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there coral-like spires visibly extending along the back of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shell-like structure in Image B is adorned with multiple spiky projections emanating from its top, resembling coral formations. These extensions are visible, providing an impression of coral-like spires. In the original Image A, such projections are absent, highlighting the unique features added to the object in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the riders been replaced with glowing, spirit-like figures that emit light and resemble sea guardians?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the riders on the silhouetted boat are still present and are not depicted as glowing or spirit-like figures. They maintain a dark silhouette similar to a real-world depiction, analogous to Image A. Thus, the characteristic emitting light figures do not replace the boat's riders.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the water trail been replaced with glowing, wave-like patterns that match the color gradient of the sunset sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water reflects a vivid blue light from the shell structure, creating a notable change from the natural pinkish sunset reflections observed in Image A. However, it does not form distinct wave-like patterns congruent with the sunset sky's gradient but instead maintains a uniform blue glow. Therefore, the water trail hasn't been fully replaced with the described wave patterns.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the mythical creature positioned in the same location as the original boat, near the center of the lower half of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B depict objects in similar positions within the image. In Image A, the boat is centrally placed near the lower half. The giant shell-like structure in Image B appears to occupy the same central position, aligning with and replacing the silhouette of the boat. This indicates that the mythical creature stands in the same location as the original boat.",
