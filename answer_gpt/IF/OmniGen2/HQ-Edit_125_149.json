      "question": "Is the bridge transformed into a creature resembling an ancient forest guardian, with organic features replacing mechanical ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible bridge structure; instead, there's a large creature appearing like an entity from a forest. This creature has characteristics that are reminiscent of trees and nature, such as a large stature and features resembling wooden texture, giving the impression of an ancient guardian of the forest. The presence of glowing eyes adds to this perception. In contrast, Image A shows a traditional bridge structure. Thus, Image B has indeed transformed the bridge concept into a creature with organic, nature-oriented features.",

      "question": "Are the bridge towers transformed into wooden limbs covered in foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a creature that has wooden-like limbs covered in foliage, which reflect a natural element replacing any mechanical form present in a bridge's tower. Given the creature's appearance with its limbs and foliage, paired with the lack of traditional bridge features that are seen in Image A (like towers), it aligns with the notion of a transformation from bridge towers to limbs covered in green growth.",

    {

      "question": "Are the bridge arches reshaped into a ribcage-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature does not exhibit any arch-like structures that could resemble a ribcage. The creature appears solid and tree-like without discernible elements similar to the arches that might be present in a bridge, as seen in Image A. Therefore, no transformation into a ribcage structure is noted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bridge cables replaced with vine-like tendrils that support the creatureâ€™s form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there are no visible cables akin to a bridge's structure, but the creature does possess features that can be interpreted as analogous to vines or tendrils, part of its naturalistic design. Though not explicitly supporting the form like bridge cables do, these elements do evoke a vine-like look, consistent with the natural theme. These are not direct transformations of bridge cables, as compared to Image A, they represent a creative shift from mechanical to organic.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the stone bases replaced with moss-covered roots extending into the flowing stream?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower part of the creature suggests rooted features that extend into what resembles a stream, and these roots appear to be moss-covered, which aligns with a transformation from man-made stone foundations in Image A to natural-root formations typical of a woodland guardian's base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the creature have a head made of bark texture with glowing emerald eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a creature with a distinct head that has a bark-like texture, distinctly different from any bridge-related structure. Moreover, the eyes of this creature are glowing emerald, enhancing the mythical or mystical appearance of the entity, which indicates a full departure from a bridge's physics-based design as seen in Image A.",
