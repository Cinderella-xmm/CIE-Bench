      "question": "Does the building now feature visible brass gears integrated into its exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building shows several large gears prominently on its exterior. By analyzing the design and color, these gears have a brass hue, which is a common element in steampunk architecture. The gears are visibly integrated into the structure in various places, leading to the conclusion that the building now features visible brass gears.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there copper-colored funnel-shaped structures present on the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays several cylindrical structures extending from the main body, resembling funnels. These elements are highlighted by their copper color, common in steampunk aesthetics. Considering their shape and color, these are funnel-shaped components made of copper.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the original glass dome been replaced with a dome featuring intricate metalwork patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dome at the top of the building is now a complex structure with metal detailing. Unlike the simple glass dome from Image A, this dome includes intricate patterns typically seen in steampunk or Victorian designs, contrasting the plain glass design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the moon in the sky replaced by one or more giant clock faces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two giant clock faces are present on elevated cylindrical structures. This transformation replaces the moon originally visible in Image A with large clocks, consistent with the steampunk theme. The change from celestial to mechanical indicates a replacement with clock faces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are rivets visibly present on the clock faces and/or the building's exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows riveted details on the clock faces and across the building's fa√ßade. Riveting is typical in mechanical constructions and steampunk design to illustrate the integration of components. The clock faces, particularly, display rivets around their circumference and edges.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Steam or vapor is visibly emitting from the top part of one cylindrical section in Image B. This presence of steam complements the industrial aspect of the steampunk theme where steam power is a highlighted element.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection of the building is not visible in any water surface, unlike Image A where the building is mirrored in the water. The absence of water reflection, possibly due to building relocation or area change, leads to the conclusion regarding the reflection's visibility.",
