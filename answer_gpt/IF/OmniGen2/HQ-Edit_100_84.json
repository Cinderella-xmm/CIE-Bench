      "question": "Is the text \"Mystic Arabian Dhow Journeys\" visible in the image as a title element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the top of the image, the text 'Mystic Arabian' is prominently displayed, and at the bottom, it reads 'Daw Ney Journeys.' 'Mystic Arabian' and 'Daw Ney Journeys' are part of the title elements, suggesting a theme related to Arabian sea travel. This positioning and style match typical title or branding elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible intricate Middle Eastern decorative patterns (such as arabesques, geometric designs, or calligraphy) on the dhow boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows detailed designs along the side of the dhow. These patterns resemble Middle Eastern arabesque or geometric styles, which are characterized by complex, flowing, or interlocking shapes. These are visible along the boat's structure, hinting at cultural artistry.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there mythical sea creatures (e.g., mermaids, sea serpents, or winged fish) with delicate, detailed features visible around the dhow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two stylized fish figures with elongated bodies and detailed fins surrounding the dhow. While they resemble fish more than mythical creatures, their exaggerated features give them a slight fantastical appearance. However, they aren't mythical in a traditional sense like mermaids or sea serpents.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are rich blue tones (in water and sky) and golden hues (in sails, light, and decorations) prominently used to create a strong visual contrast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a color palette with blue for the water and sky, and golden hues for the sails and other details, creating a vibrant contrast. The combination of these colors enhances the visual appeal and supports the exotic and vivid theme of the image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the distant sailboats in the background rendered as simple, dark silhouettes without visible sails or structural detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fresh design does not include typical photographic details like distant silhouetted sailboats which can be seen in Image A. This absence of silhouetted elements points to a focus on graphic style rather than photo-realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a faint, shimmering Arabian-style skyline mirage with geometric patterns visible along the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background with an illustrated skyline composed of domes and minarets, typical of Arabian architecture. These structures have simple, yet recognizable geometric outlines but do not present a shimmering mirage or detailed geometric patterns.",
