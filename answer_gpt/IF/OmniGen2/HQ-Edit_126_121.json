        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The current view of Image B only shows the front and partial side of the cereal box, without visible content on the back. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine if there are jungle illustrations or fun facts about gorillas present on the back. Common sense dictates such content might exist on the package, but it is not visible here.",
