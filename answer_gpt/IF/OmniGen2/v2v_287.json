      "question": "Is the train depicted as a 3D voxel model with a blocky, pixelated appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is depicted with smooth surfaces and realistic reflections, lacking any blocky or pixelated appearance typically associated with voxel models. The design is sleek and modern, consistent with real-world high-speed trains. The lack of block-like formations or pixelation confirms that it is not depicted as a voxel model.",

      "question": "Does the train's 3D voxel model use a similar color palette and design simplicity as the icons shown in the left image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a train with a realistic and detailed design, featuring a nuanced color palette with gradients and reflections lacking the simplistic, blocky aesthetic common in voxel models. The train's detailed design and the lighting effects do not match the simplicity of icons commonly found in voxel-style art.",

      "question": "Is the entire image rendered in high enough detail to suggest an 8k resolution, with no visible pixelation or blur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is rendered with high detail and clarity, suggesting a high resolution. The elements such as the train, platform, and signage are sharp and detailed without any visible pixelation or blur, which could indicate an 8k resolution level of detail.",
      "weight": 1,

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the train's 3D voxel model exhibit clean, precise shading and lighting effects consistent with those produced by Octane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shading and lighting are smooth and realistic. However, since the train is not depicted as a 3D voxel model, the question is inherently misleading. The lighting is precise, but it does not align with the typical rendering style of voxel models using Octane, which often incorporate a more stylized, exaggerated lighting. The realistic lighting here is more typical for high-resolution photographic renderings.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the 3D voxel model of the train retain the original train's proportions and overall shape, making it recognizable despite the stylistic change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train in Image B retains the realistic proportions and overall shape of a standard high-speed train, consistent with the original train seen in Image A. However, since it is not depicted as a voxel model, the question's premise is incorrect. The recognizable shape and design elements are due to high fidelity and not a voxel-style representation.",
