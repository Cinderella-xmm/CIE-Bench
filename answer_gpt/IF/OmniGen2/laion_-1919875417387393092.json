      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pottery setup is clearly enclosed within a transparent glass cloche. This can be determined from the presence of a glass dome that covers the setup, commonly used for display and protection purposes. The glass surface reflects light, indicating its transparency and the fact that it encloses the items beneath it.",

      "question": "Do the clay pieces display a vibrant patina with visible coloration (e.g., green, blue, or copper tones) rather than plain gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clay pieces in Image B are predominantly gray, as observed from their solid color with no additional vibrant patina or coloration visible. The pottery items lack any hints or streaks of colors such as green, blue, or copper tones, suggesting they are unadorned and kept plain gray.",

      "question": "Are there miniature fairy figures visible, actively kneading clay, and located among pottery tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a miniature fairy figure present near the pottery setup. However, this figure is holding a gardening tool and is not actively kneading clay. The fairy is standing beside pottery items but is engaged in a different activity, suggesting it is more decorative rather than functional in clay manipulation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays patches of green moss surrounding the setup, and small flowers are visible in the moss area. This indicates a decorative element added to enhance the visual appeal, contrasting with the plain wooden texture typically seen in a traditional pottery setup. The moss and flowers are arranged aesthetically around the base of the setup.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible wooden plaque with engraved text or artisan details at the base of the structure in Image B. The base appears to be wooden, but there is no indication of any plaque with text or specific details engraved on it.",
