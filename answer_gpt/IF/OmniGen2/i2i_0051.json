        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B immediately presents itself as an oil painting, showcasing a smooth and glossy texture.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the areas that resemble horse hair and sand in Image B, there are no noticeable thick brush textures. The texture in these areas appears smooth and finely detailed, rather than rough or thickly painted, which is typically associated with oil paintings that might depict such subjects.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background houses and landscape elements appear to have a softened edge. This indicates a painting style where the focus is not sharp or photographic, but rather has a blurred, gentle quality akin to soft-focus techniques commonly used in classical landscape paintings to enhance atmospheric effects.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B consists of soft, warm tones with natural shifts in lighting that evoke the feeling of 19th-century naturalist paintings. These paintings typically feature harmonious colors that reflect the natural environment, using warm sunlight and earth tones to create an inviting and realistic imagery similar to what is observed in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a composition where figures are gracefully positioned across the center, balanced by the net lines and tennis equipment on both sides. This creates an organized layout familiar in artistic compositions that align with aesthetic principles in painting. The harmonious arrangement is consistent with artistic standards ensuring both visual appeal and narrative clarity.",
