      "question": "Does the edited image depict the camera with intricate gears and mechanical components characteristic of steampunk design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera is illustrated with design elements that are more ornate and decorative than what is found on typical digital cameras. While it doesn't explicitly display gears or mechanical components, the overall aesthetic and embellishments on the camera resemble a steampunk motif, which often includes such features. The aesthetic hints at a steampunk influence, even if gears are not explicitly shown.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the camera and tripod in the edited image rendered with a metallic finish resembling brass, iron, or similar materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a color palette and shading that suggest a metallic finish, particularly shades that resemble brass, a common material in steampunk designs. The use of golden and brown tones with smooth gradient transitions supports the appearance of a polished metal finish.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image include visible rivets, bolts, or pipe-like structures as part of the camera and tripod design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, features stylized elements that imply structural reinforcement, such as those found in steampunk designs, like rivets or bolts. However, these elements aren't explicitly detailed as individual rivets or pipe-like structures but rather as part of a cohesive decorative design suggesting industrial motifs.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting in the edited image emphasize the metallic textures through strong contrasts and reflections, enhancing the three-dimensional appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is done in such a way that it creates a strong contrast between light and shadow, highlighting the contours and edges of the camera and tripod, giving them a more three-dimensional metallic look. This kind of lighting effect is typical to accentuate the shine and reflections often associated with metal.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image incorporate signs of aging or weathering, such as rust or scratches, on the metallic surfaces of the camera and tripod?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image doesn't display explicit indicators of aging or weathering like rust or scratches that are typical in steampunk designs which often embrace a weathered look. Instead, it maintains an appearance of polished and well-maintained metal surfaces.",
