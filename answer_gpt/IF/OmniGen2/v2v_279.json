        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the bird displays a more simplified, cartoonish appearance with exaggerated features typical of a 3D chibi-style model. Its rounder body, simplified details, and large eye compared to realistic depictions indicate a transformation into a chibi-style model. This is evident through the distinct chibi-style characteristics combined with world knowledge of common 3D art styles.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the human figures display clear signs of being converted into 3D chibi-style models. Their bodies are more rounded and proportionally exaggerated, with simplified facial features and a smoother, cartoon-like quality. This distinct style conversion is recognized through world knowledge of chibi characteristics in 3D modeling.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image retains the key features of the outfits and accessories, such as the tank top, belt, and pocket watch, although they are depicted in a more stylized manner suitable for chibi-style models. The essential forms and elements are consistent with those in the original image, suggesting that the outfits and accessories are preserved in essence.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the positions of the characters, bird, and lemur are maintained consistently. The central character, the presence of a microscope, the bird flying above, and the lemur on the tree remain in the same relative positioning across both versions. This indicates that the overall scene arrangement and layout have been preserved.",
