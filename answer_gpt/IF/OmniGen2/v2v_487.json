      "question": "Is there a 3D chibi-style figure emerging from the kayak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a 3D chibi-style figure is visible seated inside a yellow kayak on the water. The chibi-style is characterized by its cute, cartoonish representation with exaggerated features, suitable for such stylistic depictions. The kayak being used is distinct from a real-world object and appears animated, which is consistent with the chibi style. Therefore, the presence of a 3D chibi-style figure is evident.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure appear to be crossing the kayakâ€™s edge and stepping into the real-world environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure remains entirely within the animated environment depicted in the Polaroid photograph. There is no indication that the figure is interacting with or stepping out into a real-world physical environment, as it is contained within the virtual context of water and trees. The figure appears seated in the kayak, not transitioning into any other setting.",

      "question": "Is the scene framed within a Polaroid photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows that the scene including the chibi-style figure in the kayak on a body of water with a distant landscape of trees is contained within a square frame with a white border generally associated with a Polaroid photo. This Polaroid style is characterized by the iconic square photo format and shiny surface, which is present here.",

      "question": "Is the Polaroid photograph being held by a human hand in the overall composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the borders of the Polaroid photograph being secure within the fingertips, suggesting a human hand is grasping it. The presence of fingers around the frame, coupled with the skin texture, is a direct indication of a human hand holding the photograph.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the items in Image A, namely the kayak and skateboard, are not visible or recognizable in the Polaroid composition. Image B contains only the stylized depiction of a kayak within the Polaroid picture alongside the chibi figure, different from the original items viewed from a top-down perspective on a concrete surface in Image A.",
