      "question": "Is the lion rendered as a high-contrast silhouette with minimal internal detail and strong edge definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is depicted as a solid black shape against a lighter background, which creates a strong contrast. There are no internal details visible within the silhouette, reinforcing the idea of minimal internal detail. The lion's outline is sharp and clean, providing strong edge definition. Using world knowledge about silhouettes, this type of representation focuses on the external shape rather than any internal features, thus confirming the rendering style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the background been replaced with an abstract gradient composed of smooth color transitions rather than a realistic savannah landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background lacks the detailed elements typical of a realistic savannah landscape, such as fully detailed clouds or vegetation. Instead, it features a smooth gradient of colors transitioning from light to dark, providing an abstract feel. This observation, in combination with world knowledge about abstract gradients being a common way to avoid detailed rendering, leads to the conclusion that the background has been replaced.",

      "question": "Are detailed grass textures clearly visible in the foreground of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass is depicted as a uniform black area with a silhouette of dense blades at the bottom, lacking the texture variation that would indicate detailed grass. This depiction is consistent with stylized silhouette artwork where surface textures are intentionally omitted. Therefore, the visible grass is not detailed but abstractly represented.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the acacia trees depicted as angular, stylized silhouettes with sharp edges and geometric forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the acacia trees as dark, angular shapes against the lighter background. The forms of the trees are simplified, with sharp, well-defined edges and a geometric structure. This is consistent with a stylized silhouette approach often seen in graphic design where complex structures are reduced to basic shapes and edges for visual clarity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title \"King of the Wild\" displayed in a dramatic, bold typeface across the upper section of the image without overpowering the lion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title \"King of the Wild\" in Image B is prominently placed at the top and uses a bold, uppercase typeface. It stands out against the lighter background but does not overwhelm the presence of the large black lion silhouette below it. The bold font makes the title noticeable yet balanced with the overall composition, maintaining the lion as the focal point.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lion positioned centrally and visually dominant in the composition, ensuring it remains the primary focus despite other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion silhouette is placed such that it occupies a central and significant portion of the image, making it immediately noticeable. Its large size relative to the other stylized elements and its strong contrast against the background contribute to its dominance, ensuring it remains the primary focus of the composition.",
