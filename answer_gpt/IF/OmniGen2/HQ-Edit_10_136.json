      "question": "Is the girl depicted in a cartoonized style with exaggerated features and an enlarged strumming hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's depiction is stylized, resembling a cartoon. The features are smooth, and while the strumming hand isn't prominently exaggerated in size, the overall appearance leans towards a cartoon-like representation. The use of smoother lines and a simplification of detail supports this cartoonized style.",

      "question": "Are the wall posters enhanced with vibrant band logos rendered in a watercolor style, showing visible brushwork and color diffusion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The posters on the wall in Image B are indeed bright and colorful, and they feature band logos. However, they lack the visible brushwork and color diffusion typical of a watercolor style. The colors and designs are more solid and graphic than watercolor, suggesting a more graphic design style without watercolor effects.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a whimsical cat silhouette is indeed visible, but it is located on the wall poster rather than on the bed. The simplification and stylization align with a whimsical presentation, although the pastel color description isn't explicitly fulfilled as they are more vibrant.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small decorative box is seen on the bed rather than on a bedside table. The box has artistic elements that give it a decorative appearance, but there is no indication of a bedside table present in the image.",
