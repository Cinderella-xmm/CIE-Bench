      "question": "Does the edited image feature bold black outlines around figures and objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, bold black outlines are prominently used around the figures, such as the womanâ€™s kimono and the cherry blossom branches. This is characteristic of traditional Japanese woodblock prints, also known as ukiyo-e, where bold lines are used to define shapes and forms clearly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors on the kimono flat and uniform without gradients or realistic shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors on the kimono in Image B appear uniform and without gradients. Instead of the nuanced shading and highlights seen in more realistic styles, the colors are applied evenly, consistent with traditional illustration techniques such as those used in ukiyo-e art, where solid colors were often used without blending.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms depicted with simplified shapes and muted pink hues rather than vibrant or detailed rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms are shown with simplified shapes and lack the intricate details or vibrant colors that would be found in a more realistic artistic style. This approach results in a more stylized look, characteristic of traditional Japanese art, where shapes are often simplified and colors are more muted.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The path stones and poles in Image B appear uniform and do not showcase textured patterns that mimic hand-carved or elaborate designs. They are processed in a simple manner with fewer details, consistent with a stylized representation rather than a realistic one.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does include stylized distant rolling hills that resemble the manner in which landscapes are depicted in ukiyo-e, a traditional Japanese art form. These hills lack intricate detailing and instead are shown in simple, stylized forms that focus on outlines and color blocks.",
