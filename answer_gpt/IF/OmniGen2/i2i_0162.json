        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartoonish design with smooth curves, bright colors, and well-defined lines, characteristics consistent with Pixar animations. The mouse character has large, expressive eyes and a friendly appearance, typical of Pixar's animation style. These visual elements, combined with the overall tidy and polished look of the scene, contribute to the clean-lined aesthetic associated with Pixar.",

      "question": "Are the textures in the image smooth and simplified in a manner consistent with cartoon-style rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures are notably smooth, with minimal detail reflecting the simplification found in cartoon-style rendering. The mouse has a glossy, gradient color without intricate fur textures, and the floor appears uniformly colored with subtle shading rather than realistic texture detail. These characteristics align with the simplified aesthetic typical in cartoon animations.",

      "question": "Does the image feature soft shadowing around the mouse and surrounding objects, contributing to a Pixar-like depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadowing in Image B is gentle and nuanced, such as the soft transition of shadows under the mouse and around the crumbs. This technique enhances the perception of depth and three-dimensionality, reminiscent of lighting methods used in Pixar animations to create a more vivid and tactile environment.",

      "question": "Has the lighting in the image been adjusted to create a soft, diffused effect typical of Pixar animations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is bright but warm, casting soft highlights and contributing to an inviting atmosphere. It creates a diffused glow that avoids harsh contrasts, achieving a balanced and visually appealing quality similar to the lighting used in Pixar films to enhance the viewer's emotional engagement with the scene.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each element from the floor tiles to the crumbs is integrated cohesively, with consistent lighting and shading that unify the entire scene. The mouse, crumbs, and background fit together smoothly without any noticeable disparity, similar to the seamless integration seen in Pixar animations where the environment feels cohesive and immersive.",
