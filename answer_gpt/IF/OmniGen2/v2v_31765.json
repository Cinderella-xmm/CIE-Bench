      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables and knife appear as simplified geometric shapes, each with distinct outlines and colors. The vegetables (carrots, celery, and onions) are represented as stylized cubes or curves, while the knife is depicted in a simplified form. This abstraction transforms realistic objects into basic geometric forms, illustrating a break down into geometric shapes. The visual cues in Image B confirm that the objects retain their basic form while being stylized in shape.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes rearranged in an abstract manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables and knife do maintain the general layout of Image A, but they are presented in a noticeably abstract style. Although the colors and shapes remain, the details are replaced by bold outlines and simplified geometric shapes, which is a hallmark of abstract art. The abstraction is most evident in the stylized design and reduced complexity of each element, indicative of abstract rearrangement.",

      "question": "Are the vegetables and knife still recognizable despite being abstracted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite their abstract representation in Image B, the vegetables and knife remain recognizable due to their distinct colors and forms. The carrots, celery, and onions retain their respective colors and basic shapes (e.g., cubes for carrots and onions, curves for celery), while the knife's silhouette is similarly identifiable. These visual cues allow viewers to easily discern the original elements despite their abstraction.",

      "question": "Has the color palette been simplified to align with Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette is indeed simplified compared to typical Cubist paintings, which often use a muted range of colors. Though colors remain vivid, they are solid blocks without gradients or shading, typical of a simplified artistic approach. This simplified palette aids in creating the abstract effect but does not strictly align with Cubist style conventions, which often use more neutral shades and fragmented perspectives.",

      "question": "Does the image show overlapping planes and multiple perspectives characteristic of Cubism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit the overlapping planes or multiple perspectives typical of Cubist artwork. The objects are presented in a single, clear perspective with no interspersed planes or alternative viewpoints. While abstract and geometric, the layout lacks the fragmented and multifaceted angle presentation often seen in Cubism.",
