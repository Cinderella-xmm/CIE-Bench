      "question": "Does the spider now appear as a mythical dream-weaver rather than a realistic spider?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a spider that has been transformed with vibrant, stained-glass-like wings and an overall surreal and artistic design. The combination of colors and the addition of decorative elements make the spider look more like a dreamlike, mythical creature rather than a real-world spider. This artistic interpretation supports the perception of it as a mythical dream-weaver.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there iridescent wings on the spider that resemble a stained-glass mosaic in design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spider is depicted with large, colorful wings that have a pattern reminiscent of stained glass mosaics with various vibrant colors subdivided into geometric shapes. This artistic style imitates stained glass and gives the appearance of iridescent wings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the spider's abdomen been replaced with a luminous orb displaying gentle, moving light patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the spider's abdomen does not show a luminous orb with moving light patterns. Instead, the focus is on the colorful wings and decorative design without a distinct glowing or patterned orb feature on the abdomen.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spider's legs are depicted with alternating light and dark bands but do not show any filigree spirals, let alone golden ones. The design seems to focus more on coloration rather than intricate patterns or spirals.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The close examination of Image B does not reveal any crystal-like or needle-like transformation in the area where the spider's fangs would be. The focus of the transformations is more on the wings and general body design rather than detailed fangs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spider is surrounded by an artistic design that includes bright colors and an overall glowing effect around it, especially with the wings' bright and colorful depiction. This can be interpreted as an ethereal glow or aura, enhancing the mystical appearance of the spider.",
