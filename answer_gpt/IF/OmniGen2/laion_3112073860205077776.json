        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text at the top clearly reads 'Food Good Breakest Chloices,' indicating an error in the title. The intended words do not match 'Berry Good Breakfast Choices,' as it has been spelled incorrectly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie slice illustration includes prominent, vibrant blueberries with bright colors on the surface. This is unlike Image A, where the blueberries are more realistic and less vibrant. The design in Image B emphasizes blueberries more vividly.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blueberries on the illustration do not have any visible labels individually identifying their nutritional properties. While there are text elements elsewhere, none are directly labeling each blueberry.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon-like tea mug appears to be associated with text that suggests a speech bubble, which implies it's presenting information or tips. However, the text itself is not clearly readable due to errors, but the visual intent is to show communication.",

      "question": "Does the chart use warm pastel colors (e.g., soft orange, pink, yellow) to highlight its information?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chart area and surrounding design predominantly feature warm colors, such as orange. These suggest the use of warm colors in the design for emphasis.",
