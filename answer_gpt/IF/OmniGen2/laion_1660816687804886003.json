    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the object now shaped like a modern energy drink can instead of a sneaker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the object retains the overall shape of a sneaker, with distinctive sneaker elements such as laces, a mesh pattern, and a sole. These features are characteristic of a shoe rather than a cylindrical can, which would typically lack such features. Hence, the object in Image B does not resemble the typical shape or features of a can.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the can feature the navy blue mesh pattern from the original sneaker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object displays a navy blue mesh pattern on the surface, similar to that typically found on sneakers for breathability and aesthetics. These patterns are often associated with athletic shoes, which is consistent with the object’s identity as a sneaker in both images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the brand logo (circular emblem with red and blue sections) visible on the front of the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible circular emblem with red and blue sections that resembles a brand logo on the object. Such logos are typically prominent on commercial products for branding purposes but are not present in the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bold laces represented as embossed or raised textures wrapped around the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object shows bold laces textured across the top, consistent with how laces are applied on sneakers. These are not representative of something typically seen on a can, but rather enhance the sneaker appearance by showing how the laces wrap around it.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the three navy blue stripes from the sole appear as a dynamic pattern on the bottom half of the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three navy blue stripes along the lower edge of the sneaker-like object, reminiscent of athletic brand designs, and closely mimic the stripe placement from Image A’s sneaker sole. These stripes would be uncharacteristic on a typical can but are appropriate for shoe designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the word \"Kickstart\" written in red lettering on the white upper portion of the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the object displays the word 'Kickstart' in large red letters on a white background. This type of typography aligns with branding practices seen for startup language or motivational themes, but it is notable here since it replaces a typical sneaker brand logo that was present in Image A.",
