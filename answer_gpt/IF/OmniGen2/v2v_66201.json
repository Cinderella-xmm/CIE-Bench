        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Victorian attire appears intact and detailed with clear lines and buttons. There are no indications of it dissolving into cosmic dust. The fabric appears to be well-defined and cohesive. Thus, from the visual cues combined with the understanding of fabric depiction, the attire remains distinct and unaltered in form.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass scientific instrument is depicted with additional intricate, winding tendrils extending from it, resembling clockwork mechanisms. This is a distinct addition to the instrument, making it more complex and visually elaborate compared to a standard scientific device.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clockwork tendrils are depicted as emanating from the brass instrument but do not appear to be making contact with or grasping the monkey's hands. They remain distinct elements in the scene, without showing interaction with the monkey's hands.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction in Image B, with the surreal combination of Victorian attire, cosmic background, and fantastical brass instrument with tendrils, all contribute to a dreamlike atmosphere. Such elements are characteristic of Surrealism, which often combines ordinary objects in extraordinary ways to evoke a sense of the uncanny or dreamlike.",

        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall composition regarding the positioning of the monkey and the primary brass instrument appears consistent with the placement in Image A. The monkey maintains a similar posture, and the main instrument remains at the center. This suggests that the primary composition elements have been preserved.",
