      "question": "Are the wings replaced with large, angular crystal shards in shades of opal and white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in the edited image B are indeed large, angular looking, and appear to have a crystalline structure with shades of opal and white. In the original image A, the wings are more traditional-looking with feather-like structures and do not contain the angular crystal appearance. This indicates a clear change in the wing design from the original to the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hair replaced with golden, leafy strands woven into a crown-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, there is a notable addition of a crown-like structure on top of the hair, composed of golden, leafy elements. The original image A shows regular hair without such a golden crown addition. The change involves adding a crown-shaped element made from golden leaves.",

      "question": "Has the shirt been changed to a smooth velvet material while maintaining a white color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shirt in image B appears to retain its white color. However, the material looks consistent with the original image A and does not exhibit qualities specifically characteristic of velvet, such as a plush texture or visible sheen. Therefore, the material has not been visibly altered to velvet.",

      "question": "Is the background a plain, deep gray wall with no visible objects or textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in image B is indeed a plain, deep gray wall, which contrasts significantly from the background in image A, which has visible objects and textures. This change simplifies the background by removing other elements, aligning with a deep gray minimalistic style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the blurred face in both images, the posture and positioning of the figure in image B appear consistent with image A. There are no significant alterations in the figure’s stance, clothing fit, or body proportions between the two, suggesting that these aspects remain unchanged.",
