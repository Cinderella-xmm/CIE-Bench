      "question": "Are there exactly six separate chibi-style illustrations, each depicting one of the specified elements (blouse, lehenga, dupatta, jewelry, bangles, background)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, it contains six distinct circular frames containing illustrations of a character. Each of these illustrations seems to capture various elements of traditional attire: blouse, lehenga, dupatta, and jewelry. Each illustration contains a unique combination of these elements, but not exclusively one. Therefore, each illustration does not solely depict an individual element such as just the blouse or dupatta. Thus, there are six separate illustrations but not each depicting only one of the specified elements.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do all six magnets exhibit a vibrant, glossy surface with visible reflections or shine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The magnets in Image B have a consistent, bright and colorful appearance, which suggests an aesthetic akin to vibrant or glossy surfaces. However, the image does not explicitly show reflections or highlights indicating shininess like a glossy surface typically would. Without distinct reflections or glare, it's not accurate to conclude they exhibit a glossy surface.",

      "question": "Do all six magnets have clearly rounded edges instead of sharp corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each of the six chibi-style illustrations is contained within a circular frame. Circular shapes naturally have rounded edges with no corners, which means all six illustrations indeed feature rounded edges without any sharp corners.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does each of the six magnets accurately depict one of the following: the embellished purple blouse, the intricate lehenga with floral patterns, the red dupatta, the traditional jewelry, the silver bangles, or the ornate background wall pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the chibi-style illustrations wearing elements reminiscent of traditional attire, similar to those seen in Image A. However, each magnet does not isolate one element like solely the blouse or the dupatta; they feature combinations of these elements together, such as in a full outfit. Therefore, each illustration does not exclusively depict just one of the specified items like the embellished blouse, intricate lehenga, or red dupatta.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all six magnets rendered in a chibi art style, featuring exaggerated proportions such as large heads and simplified facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustrations in Image B feature a distinct chibi art style, characterized by large heads in proportion to the bodies and simplified features, common in chibi representations. This style is consistent across all six illustrations, highlighting the usage of exaggerated proportions typical to chibi design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the six magnets displayed as individual, standalone items arranged in a way that suggests they are part of a collectible set, rather than a single composite image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each illustration is enclosed within its own circular boundary, creating the appearance of individual standalone items. Their consistent style and uniform size suggest that they are meant to be viewed collectively, resembling the idea of a set. However, they are not presented as parts of a single composite image since each can stand alone within its boundary.",
