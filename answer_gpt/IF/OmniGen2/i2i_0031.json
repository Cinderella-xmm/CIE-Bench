      "question": "Has the lifeguard tower and yellow rescue vehicle been simplified into a minimalist safety icon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a completely white background with no distinct features or objects visible. There are no visible elements that can be interpreted as lifeguard towers or rescue vehicles, minimalist or otherwise. Therefore, the absence of any relevant imagery leads to the conclusion that the lifeguard tower and yellow rescue vehicle have not been simplified into a minimalist safety icon.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a blank white space without any colors, blocks, or defined edges. Since there are no visible elements to assess, the conclusion is that distinct color blocks and clean edges are not present in the design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entirety of Image B is composed of a white background with no additional features or icons. This indicates that any icon, had it been present, would have been set against a white background.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a white background with no visible icons or stylistic elements reminiscent of airport signage. As there is no design style present to relate to airport signage icons, the conclusion is the style does not match.",
