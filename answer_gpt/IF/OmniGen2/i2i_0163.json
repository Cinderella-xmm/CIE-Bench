      "question": "Has the background been changed to an outdoor camping scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the toasters placed in a lush green landscape with trees and hills visible in the background. This setting resembles a typical outdoor environment, possibly a park or a camping area, rather than an indoor kitchen or living room. The outdoor context is supported by the presence of bright sunlight and open space, which are typical features of a camping scene.",

      "question": "Are the toasters placed on a folding table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters are set upon a wooden table with visible hinges or joints beneath the table surface, suggesting it is collapsible or foldable. Such tables are commonly used in outdoor settings like picnics or camping due to their portable nature.",

      "question": "Is there sunlight shining on the golden toast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toast and the toasters are illuminated by intense sunlight, as evident from the bright reflections off the toaster surfaces and the sunlight visibly striking the toast from the left side, indicated by the light area on the tops of the toast slices. This sunlight is characteristic of outdoor settings during daytime.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The toasters and toast in Image B have the same design and arrangement as those in Image A. Both images show two metallic toasters side by side, each holding a slice of toast midway. Their appearance, spacing, and orientation appear identical between the two images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays sunlight coming from the left side of the frame, illuminating the toasters and toast, while casting realistic shadows along the right side and beneath the objects. The presence of natural sunlight and the accurate direction of shadows are consistent with outdoor environmental dynamics, contributing to a believable and realistic lighting scenario.",
