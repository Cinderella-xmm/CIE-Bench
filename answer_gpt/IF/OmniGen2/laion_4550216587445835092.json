    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image presented as a two-page comic spread with distinct left and right panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, two distinct panels are visible, with one on the left and one on the right, characteristic of a comic spread. These panels contain separate elements and dialogues, indicating different scenes or aspects of the story, typical of a left and right panel orientation in comics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the swirling energy blast contain visible eyes and a mischievous grin, indicating it has been anthropomorphized into a sentient spirit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the swirling energy blast on the left panel does not include visible eyes or a mischievous grin, which would suggest anthropomorphization. The blast is depicted as energy with no facial features, which implies it's a typical energy effect rather than a sentient character.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the anthropomorphized spirit clearly the central focus of the first page (left panel)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The left panel of the edited image features a swirling energy effect, but there is no anthropomorphized spirit with distinguishing human-like features such as eyes or a mouth, which would be characteristic of a sentient focus. Therefore, the energy visual is the focus, not an anthropomorphized spirit.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the first page include a dialogue bubble with the exact text \"You've met your match, ninja! Prepare yourself!\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dialogue bubble on the left panel of the edited image contains different text, 'YOU'VE SEET YUR DECH, PREPARE CLASH, MERGINE WITH THE FORGE STRKE!'. This does not match the provided text, indicating a discrepancy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the second page (right panel) show a visual depiction of the spirit merging with the opposing force, such as overlapping energy forms or a unified strike?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right panel of the edited image features a character with energy surrounding him, but there is no clear depiction of this energy merging with an opposing force. The character's portrayal focuses on his expressive stance rather than explicitly demonstrating merging forces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the second page include an action bubble with the exact text \"Ultimate fusion strike!\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dialogue bubble in the right panel of the edited image reads 'CLIMAP OF KNEMATIC FUSION OPPONG YOU!', which is different from 'Ultimate fusion strike!'. This indicates that the action text differs in wording.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the background of the second page feature swirling debris and elemental fragments to represent chaos?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right panel shows a background with swirling forms and energy, but it mostly highlights the character and energy form rather than depicting chaos through debris or elemental fragments. The visual focus is on the character's animated presence rather than environmental chaos.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
