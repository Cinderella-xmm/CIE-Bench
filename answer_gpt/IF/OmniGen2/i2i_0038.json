        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a person in a cartoon line-art style, which is characterized by simplified shapes, bold outlines, and exaggerated features typical of cartoon illustrations.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon iteration of the person has a closed mouth with no expression of an open mouth visible. The focus is on the simplified trademark style of cartoon line-art, which often omits intricate facial expressions like an open mouth.",
