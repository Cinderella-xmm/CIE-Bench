      "question": "Are the snowy mountain peaks visibly reshaped into jagged, wing-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowy mountain peaks maintain their natural shape and structure. They do not display any transformation into jagged, wing-like formations. Mountains naturally have a variety of shapes, but wing-like features would be distinct and noticeable if present. Upon careful observation, the mountains retain their original form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the foreground lake display a pattern of reflective, scale-like textures across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the foreground lake appears smooth with some natural icy or reflective textures typical of water bodies. These textures do not resemble scale-like patterns. Scale-like textures would be distinct, repetitive patterns, which are absent in the lake area.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the winding peninsula reshaped into a long, curving, sinewy tail structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the peninsula as a natural landform extending into the water, maintaining a consistent earth-like shape. It does not present a sinewy tail-like appearance. A tail-like structure would exhibit exaggerated curves and narrowing, which are not evident here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the distant houses reconfigured into a continuous, segmented metallic spine-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distant houses are visible as distinct, normal architectural structures. They retain their original forms and have not been transformed into any continuous or segmented metallic spine structure. Such a spine would be uniform and seamless, unlike the scattered appearance of the houses.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there distinct, swirling cloud formations in the sky that resemble eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the sky primarily features a clear blue expanse with some light cloud presence. There are no distinct swirling formations that could be interpreted as eye-like structures. Such formations would be clearly identifiable if present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the grassland area show directional, windswept textures resembling fur covering the creature’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grassland in Image B presents a natural landscape with grasses and small hills. The area lacks distinct directional or windswept textures that might suggest fur-like characteristics. Fur textures would appear more uniform and combed, which are not seen here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all modified elements (wings, scales, tail, spine, eyes, fur) integrate seamlessly into a single, coherent mythical beast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a natural landscape without any elements altered to form a mythical beast. Each element—mountains, lake, peninsula, houses, sky, and grassland—maintains its standard appearance without visible modification or integration into a single entity. The lack of these modifications means there isn’t a coherent mythical beast present.",
