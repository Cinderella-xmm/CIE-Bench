      "question": "Have the visible cracks and broken areas on the clock tower been restored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B alone, the clock tower shows no visible cracks or broken areas, indicating a restoration effort. The surface appears smooth and intact, suggesting repairs to the previously damaged parts. Common sense combined with visual analysis leads to the conclusion that restoration has occurred.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any gaps or missing parts left unfilled on the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a complete structure, with all architectural elements seemingly intact and without gaps or missing parts. The archways and surfaces appear solid, suggesting that all missing parts have been adequately restored. This leads to the conclusion that no gaps or missing parts are left unfilled.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the restored parts match the original texture and color of the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the texture appears uniform, and the color harmonizes across the tower. By comparing this with Image A, the restoration seems to match the original color and architectural style closely. The thinking process involves identifying similarities in texture and color between both images, suggesting consistency in restoration.",

      "question": "Does the restored clock tower maintain the original architectural style and details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a clock tower that retains its architectural style, such as the use of Roman numerals on the clock face and the decorative elements at the pinnacle. A comparison with Image A reveals consistency in architectural design, indicating that the restoration preserves the original style. The reasoning involves examining key architectural details that have been maintained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is clearly legible, with Roman numerals well-defined and the hands visible, indicating that it is intact. Additionally, it appears clean and brightly finished, facilitating readability. This analysis concludes that the restoration ensures legibility and intactness of the clock face.",
