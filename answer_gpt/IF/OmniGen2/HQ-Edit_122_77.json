      "question": "Does the character appear as a youthful, mythical forest nymph rather than an elderly human woman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character has a full head of gray hair adorned with colorful flowers, which is typical of elderly women in artistic representations, suggesting wisdom and maturity rather than youthfulness. The setting and costume do create an ethereal and mythical atmosphere, but the overall appearance aligns more with an elderly human woman. The appearance, combined with artistic and cultural representations of both nymphs and elderly women, indicates the character is more likely an elderly human rather than a youthful nymph.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a crown made of laurel leaves and pastel-colored flowers visible on the character’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s head is adorned with pastel-colored flowers, which are not laurel leaves. The vegetation includes flowers that resemble lotus and other blooming types with detailed textures, creating a floral crown effect. Therefore, the head adornment in Image B primarily features flowers and lacks the specific visual characteristic of a laurel leaf crown.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character's hair as white with a natural human texture and is decorated with flowers, which are distinctly separate from the hair. The hair does not resemble vine-like tendrils; instead, it retains the normal characteristics of human hair combined with floral embellishments.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is wearing a long, flowing dress in a bright emerald green color that covers her whole body, replacing any semblance of a shawl seen in Image A. The garment is draped in a style similar to classical attire, matching the description provided.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a background featuring an arrangement of twisted olive trees characteristic of ancient groves. The visible white structures scattered across the ground resemble marble fragments, further enhancing the antiquity of the setting. This combination aligns with the description of an ancient grove.",

      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B features balanced, natural lighting that highlights the vivid colors of the character's dress and floral adornment without any significant mist or glowing effects. The overall atmosphere is enhanced through the setting and composition, though it does not solely rely on soft lighting or mist for an ethereal effect.",
