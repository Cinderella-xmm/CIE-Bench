      "question": "Does the image exhibit characteristics of ukiyo-e art such as flat color areas, strong outlines, and stylized forms instead of realistic 3D rendering?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows visual cues characteristic of ukiyo-e art by employing flat areas of color, particularly in the blue robes, and strong outlines to define shapes. This style is known for its artistic expression rather than realistic 3D rendering. The manner in which the elements are portrayed aligns with traditional ukiyo-e, which emphasizes aesthetics over realistic depiction.",
