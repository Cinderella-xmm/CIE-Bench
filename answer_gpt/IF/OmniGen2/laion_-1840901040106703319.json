      "question": "Has the log cabin been replaced with a geometric crystal structure made of transparent, faceted surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a geometric crystal structure characterized by transparent, faceted surfaces, different from a log cabin. The structure's design is modern and crystalline, without any elements resembling a traditional log cabin. By recognizing the material and form variation, it confirms the replacement of the cabin with this crystal structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the exterior surfaces of the structure consist of transparent, faceted planes that reflect or refract blue and green hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure's exterior is clearly made of transparent, faceted planes that display reflections and refractions in shades of blue and green. These color effects are apparent due to the nature of the material and facets capturing light in different ways, supporting the conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all wooden beams and structural supports been replaced with meticulously cut, multifaceted crystal edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits no wooden beams or structural elements typical of a cabin. Instead, the structure is composed entirely of multifaceted crystal edges, indicating a transformation from wood to crystal. The detailed and precise cut of these edges is apparent, consistent with replacing wooden structures.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the crystal structure resting on a flat, white marble platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts the crystal structure situated atop a flat, white marble platform. The smooth, polished surface of the marble serves as the base, revealing a contrast between the sleek platform and the angular crystal structure above.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small crystal formations present as decorative accents along the base of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are evident small crystal formations situated around the base of the main structure, serving as decorative accents. These formations enhance the aesthetic appeal and support the query about their presence.",
