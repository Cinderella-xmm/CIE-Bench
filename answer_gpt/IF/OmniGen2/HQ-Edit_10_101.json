    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the surface of the image rendered with a visible textured canvas effect, such as fabric-like weave or uneven surface detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cardigan within a frame against a floral wallpaper. The image itself appears to be smoothly rendered rather than textured or fabric-like. The appearance of textures is limited to the cardigan's design, rather than the print or canvas effect of the image as a whole.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the knit patterns on the cardigan visibly exaggerated, with enhanced depth, contrast, or stitch definition compared to normal knitting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knit patterns on the cardigan in Image B are highly defined with noticeable depth and contrast. The exaggerated cable knit and ribbing are more pronounced than what is typically seen in standard knitting, indicating enhanced detail in the representation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the buttons on the cardigan exhibit metallic sheen or reflective qualities, such as highlights, shine, or a non-matte finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buttons on the cardigan in Image B have a glossy finish that suggests a metallic sheen, as there are visible highlights and reflections that indicate they aren't matte.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall color palette of the image use soft, warm tones (such as muted golds, creams, or earthy browns) rather than cool or neutral colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly uses earthy browns for the cardigan, with a warm tone complementing the floral wallpaper in muted reds and greens. These tones create a soft, warm atmosphere contrasting with cooler or neutral palettes.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frames in Image B do not exhibit detailed embroidery or decorative stitching. They are simple and plain without any intricate designs, focusing instead on the cardigan detail.",

    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
