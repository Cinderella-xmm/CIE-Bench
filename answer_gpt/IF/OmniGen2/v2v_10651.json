      "question": "Do the bottle, opener, and glass appear to be modeled out of textured clay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle, opener, and glass all have a matte finish with smooth surfaces and simplified shapes, which are consistent with items crafted from clay. There is a lack of detailed texture that typically characterizes real glass or metal, further supporting the clay-like appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the warm and inviting fireplace setting preserved in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible fire in a fireplace, similar to Image A, maintaining the warm glow coming from the fire. The presence of this feature suggests that the setting's warmth and invitation are preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the original materials of the bottle, opener, and glass been replaced with a clay-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bottle, opener, and glass with surfaces that look smooth and lack the shiny, light-reflective quality of glass and metal seen in Image A. This suggests that the materials have been changed to resemble clay, which typically has a more matte and uniform appearance.",

      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall scene resemble a handmade claymation scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects appear simplified and stylized with a smooth finish, typical for handcrafted claymation models. The textural details and material realism present in Image A are transformed into more basic forms, contributing to a claymation aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B uses clay-like materials, the lighting still provides a warm atmosphere similar to Image A. The warm color palette and presence of a bright fire continue to evoke a cozy ambiance, matching the inviting feel of the original image.",
