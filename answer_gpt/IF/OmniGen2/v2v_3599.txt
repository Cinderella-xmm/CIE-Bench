    "Question": "Q2: Are the knights positioned in the same places as the original stuffed animals were?",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the knights sitting in a position similar to how the stuffed animals were seated?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the stuffed animals are depicted as seated on the floor with a relaxed posture typical of plush items. Image B features knights standing upright, which deviates from the seated posture seen in Image A. The structural design of the armor suggests a standing, rather than sitting, position, hence confirming a difference in posture.",
