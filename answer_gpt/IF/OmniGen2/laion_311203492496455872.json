        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a suit with a shiny, glossy surface suggestive of a 3D rendering effect, similar to materials used in creating paper dolls digitally. However, I do not observe bold geometric patterns that clearly distinguish it as a paper doll style based on that specific description.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tie appears larger and more exaggerated in size compared to the typical tie. Its color scheme is bright, featuring shades of blue, which suggests a cartoonish element. Thus, the transformation into a cartoon-style tie is evident.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blur applied to the face in both images, visual observation of facial features and expressions is obscured. Therefore, no definitive comparison can be made regarding whether facial features and expressions have remained unchanged.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The modified elements in Image B, such as the cotton candy-like hairstyle, the shiny appearance of the suit, and the cartoonish tie, are presented in a stylized manner. They do not exhibit realistic elements, maintaining consistency with the themes of cotton candy, digital design, and cartoon styling.",
