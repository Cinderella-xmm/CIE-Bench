    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical or dome-shaped structure resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues clearly show the scene encapsulated within a transparent spherical structure, similar to a snow globe. This conclusion is drawn from the observation of the glass-like material and the curvature of the enclosure, which are typical features of a snow globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the upper tier display a detailed Paris skyline composed of buildings with metallic textures or finishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper tier of the scene does not display buildings with metallic textures or finishes. Instead, the skyline seems to be a simple background illustration with minimal detail, merely providing context to the Eiffel Tower models inside the snow globe. This is determined by the lack of shiny or reflective surfaces typically associated with metallic finishes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the lower tier contain dense, vibrant green vegetation including trees, hedges, and garden elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features dense, vibrant green vegetation within the spherical structure. Trees, hedges, and garden elements are visually prominent, sharing characteristics of rich green tones and neatly arranged garden features, consistent with model landscaping in miniature displays.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible silvery or white flake-like particles floating between the upper and lower tiers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no silvery or white flake-like particles floating within the spherical structure. Common snow globes may have such elements, but this image only displays the scene without any snowfall-like components. The absence of these particles within the enclosure supports this assessment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base of the scene feature sculpted cobblestone patterns and classic street lamps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, rather than featuring cobblestone patterns at the base, there is a distinct architectural base with illuminated windows and traditional street lamps mounted on its circumference. The design reflects classic street elements, which can be viewed clearly in the detailed lower part of the snow globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there exactly two Eiffel Towers visible in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly depicts two Eiffel Towers within the spherical enclosure. This is observed by the presence of both structures standing side by side, which contributes to the whimsical design of the snow globe scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the scene exhibit characteristics of a miniature 3D model, such as exaggerated perspective, reduced scale, or model-like textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B embodies the features of a miniature 3D model very clearly. The exaggerated perspective of the scene, reduced scale of buildings and trees, and the textures used highlight characteristics consistent with model design, supporting the idea that this is a small-scale replica contained within a snow globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
