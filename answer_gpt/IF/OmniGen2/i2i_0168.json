    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the background replaced with snow and icebergs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background clearly depicts snow and icebergs. The bright white and icy blue hues typically represent snow and ice formations found in icy polar regions. These visuals differ from typical garden or soil backgrounds, indicating an environment not typically associated with growing carrots naturally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the carrots still rooted in soil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots are visibly embedded in a dark brown substance, which appears to be rich, fertile soil. This suggests the carrots remain rooted in soil similar to how they would be in a garden setting, even with the Arctic-like background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the carrots retain their original appearance in terms of color and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots appear vivid orange with green foliage on top, maintaining a recognizable carrot form. This is consistent with the typical appearance of carrots, not indicating alterations to their color or shape compared to standard carrot imagery.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image show a clear contrast between the Arctic background and the soil around the carrots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a notable contrast between the dark, earthy tones of the soil and the bright, cold colors of the snowy background. This contrast emphasizes the visual distinction between the natural habitat of the carrots and the unusual surrounding environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall setting of the image consistent with an Arctic environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B features snow and icebergs in the background suggesting an Arctic environment, the presence of fresh carrots planted in soil contradicts typical Arctic conditions, which are not conducive to such vegetation growth. Therefore, while the background suggests an Arctic setting, the presence of soil and carrots creates inconsistency with an authentic Arctic environment.",
