    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire castle scene enclosed within a transparent glass orb?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle scene is clearly enclosed within a transparent glass orb, as suggested by the rounded shape surrounding the castle and knight, indicative of a snow globe-like structure. The visual cue of a spherical transparent boundary is commonly associated with glass orbs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stone textures on the castle walls visibly smaller and more detailed, consistent with a minified appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature version of the castle within the glass orb, where the textures appear to be scaled down. This visual portrayal is common in models or miniatures where the elements are detailed and reduced in size to fit a smaller scale environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the knightâ€™s armor and the gate structure rendered in an antique bronze color with visible aging effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor and gate structure in Image B are not depicted in an antique bronze color. Instead, they maintain a shiny, metallic appearance that lacks visible aging effects, suggesting a more pristine finish typical of newly crafted armor and gates rather than an aged look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small, fluttering heraldic flags visible on the battlements of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small heraldic flags are seen atop the battlements of the castle. These flags portray common elements found in symbolic representations of castles, indicating attention to detail and thematic continuity consistent with traditional heraldic displays.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small turrets and crenellated walls arranged in a circular pattern around the base of the glass orb?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a circular arrangement of turrets and crenellated walls at the base of the orb. Instead, the depicted scene is centrally enclosed without additional circular structures at the base, which aligns more with a straightforward model or diorama within a glass sphere.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are golden light rays visibly sculpted into the glass of the orb, emanating from behind the castle to simulate a rising sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays golden light rays emanating from behind the castle within the orb. These sculpted light rays simulate a rising sun effect, commonly used in artistic renderings to create a dramatic backdrop and enhance the visual appeal of the scene.",
