      "question": "Does the butterfly appear as a dynamic vortex of swirling cerulean and indigo energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is surrounded by an illuminated swirling pattern that blends shades of cerulean and indigo, creating a dynamic vortex effect. This interpretation is strengthened by the fluid, wave-like design that conjures an energetic atmosphere. Such visual cues suggest movement and energy radiating around the butterfly, resembling a vortex.",

      "question": "Are there faint trails of light emanating from the butterfly's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the butterfly with a bright aura extending outward, resembling trails of light emanating from its wings. The blending of the swirling colors gives the impression of light or energy radiating away, which can be interpreted as faint trails of light.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dark lower mass resemble a chasm of fractured, glossy obsidian?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dark lower mass in Image B is solid and has an irregular silhouette that contrasts with the vibrant energy above. By common interpretation of visual cues, its appearance is uniform, lacking distinct glossy or fractured characteristics typically associated with obsidian. Thus, it does not resemble a chasm of fractured, glossy obsidian.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a mystical ambiance through the ethereal swirling patterns and intense hues surrounding the butterfly. The diffuse light and blending shades create a nebulous atmosphere, giving the overall image a mystical quality.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly seems to be positioned with space between it and the dark lower mass, enhanced by the surrounding light that creates depth. This spatial arrangement suggests that the butterfly is hovering above the dark area.",
