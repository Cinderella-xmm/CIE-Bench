      "question": "Is the map rendered as a partially unfurled scroll floating above a stylized ocean?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the map appears as though it is a scroll positioned above a stylized ocean background. This is indicated by the visible scroll edges on the left side and the presence of a blue ocean-like texture at the bottom of the image, suggesting the map is floating above. This perception is achieved through the placement and design elements which create the illusion of depth and spatial relation between the map and the ocean.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the compass been replaced with a golden ship's wheel featuring intricate engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dominant circular object is not a compass; it has been replaced by a golden ship's wheel, as evidenced by the spokes radiating from the center typical of a ship's wheel design. The engravings around the center further enhance the ornamental aspect, differentiating it from a navigation compass.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there miniature silhouettes of explorers depicted on the map, showing motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes silhouettes of figures positioned at the bottom left of the map, resembling explorers in motion. These elements, resembling people and a small boat, convey the idea of exploration and movement despite their static representation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the title \"The Voyage of Discovery\" displayed using an elegant, vintage-style serif font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does display a title using what appears to be a vintage-style serif font. However, the title reads \"Voyage of Die Voiygery,\" which is a stylized variant and not \"The Voyage of Discovery.\" The font style is consistent with the theme but does not match the expected title exactly.",

      "question": "Are glowing gold highlights present, simulating light from lanterns, while preserving the original brown tones of the map?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features lanterns with glowing golden highlights that appear to illuminate parts of the map, contributing to a warm ambiance. However, the map in Image B does not preserve the original brown tones seen in older maps; instead, it has significant blue tones, suggesting a different color composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, historical routes are represented by dotted red lines across the map. These lines are vibrant and contrast with the map's background, indicating paths likely intended to simulate historical routes or journeys, thus matching the description provided.",
