      "question": "Does the edited image incorporate textures resembling decadent chocolate and shiny sauce in the sneaker design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sneaker has a glossy, brown texture similar to melted chocolate, and it appears to have a sauce-like substance dripping over it. This gives the visual impression of chocolate being part of the sneaker's design. The shine on the sneaker resembles a chocolate glaze, which is often seen in culinary presentations. Thus, the texture and appearance strongly suggest a decadent chocolate look.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sneaker's contours in the edited image inspired by the fluid, natural shapes of lettuce?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sneaker displays standard contours typical of a shoe, which are sleek and geometric, not resembling the irregular, organic shapes of lettuce leaves. Lettuce is also visibly present in the image, confirming that the shoe's design itself does not adopt lettuce-like shapes.",

      "question": "Does the edited image prioritize a visually imaginative concept over practicality in the sneaker design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a sneaker placed on a plate with chocolate sauce, elements not typically associated with shoe functionality. The design combines culinary elements with fashion, suggesting a focus on creativity and concept rather than practical footwear usage. The unusual and whimsical presentation supports the idea that visual imagination is prioritized over practicality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the elements of the original dish (chocolate cake and lettuce) visibly represented in the sneaker design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the dish consists of a chocolate cake with chocolate sauce and lettuce. Image B includes a sneaker that visually resembles chocolate in color and glazing, and lettuce is present beside it on the plate. These elements are reimagined into the design, illustrating a creative translation rather than a direct representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sneaker design in the edited image innovative and unique, reflecting a creative interpretation of the original dish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a sneaker that mimics the chocolate cake with its chocolate-glazed appearance and is visually paired with lettuce, much like the original dish. This reimagining embodies innovation and creativity, as it takes elements from food presentation and applies them in an unexpected context within fashion design.",
