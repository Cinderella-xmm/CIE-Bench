      "question": "Is the image showing a close-up view of the keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain is prominently displayed in the image, occupying a significant portion of the frame. This positioning and size suggest a close-up view, as the keychain is the main focal point and is shown in detail. A close-up generally indicates that the object is photographed from a short distance to highlight its features clearly.",

      "question": "Does the keychain appear to be made of soft rubber with bold black outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain has distinct and smooth surfaces, with the edges outlined in bold black lines, typical of designs made from soft rubber or PVC material. The way the character's features are molded and the clear separation between color sections suggest it's made from a pliable material, enhancing the design's durability and flexibility.",

      "question": "Does the keychain feature a chibi-style representation of the character shown in the attached image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A chibi-style design involves a small, cute appearance with exaggerated features, such as a large head compared to the body. In Image B, the keychain clearly displays these characteristics: a stylized character with a large head and petite body, fitting the chibi aesthetic. This matches the common representation seen in cartoons or anime where characters are depicted in a playful and adorable manner.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain is connected to a circular metal piece that looks like a typical silver keyring. The metallic sheen and circular shape are indicative of a keyring designed to attach to keys or other items, and its size corresponds to standard small keyrings used for keychains.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a smooth, plain gray tone, which is typically used to minimize distractions and focus attention on the subject of the photo. Such neutral backgrounds are often employed in product photography to ensure that viewers focus on the main object without external distractions.",
