      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the amphitheater is represented as a stylized, cute design with bold outlines and simplified architectural features. These characteristics are typical of kawaii design, which often involves cute interpretations and graphic simplicity. This approach suggests that the image is likely an enamel pin design.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows bold, shiny outlines around various elements of the amphitheater design. These outlines appear metallic, commonly seen in enamel pins to delineate areas and create a polished appearance. Enamel pins often incorporate metal outlines to add definition and durability, supporting the conclusion that glossy metal outlines are likely present.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features vivid colors within the amphitheater design, visible in the golden hues of the structure and the vibrant green seating area. Enamel pins typically use bright colors to enhance visual appeal and differentiate the design elements. Thus, the image indeed incorporates bright enamel colors.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses exclusively on the stylized amphitheater without additional elements or embellishments that detract from or supplement the main design feature. The visual representation keeps consistent attention on the amphitheater in the pin format, indicating the avoidance of extra components.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, displays the amphitheater design against a plain white background, which is typical for enamel pin presentations to highlight the design. However, the overall image layout is not square but instead accommodates the pin's shape, which might have curved edges. Designs are often presented in such formats for visual emphasis while not conforming strictly to a square shape.",
