      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the scene clearly shows a parrot within a transparent glass dome. The dome is shaped like a hemisphere and covers the entire scene depicted, including the parrot, leaves, and other elements inside it. The presence of the glass is indicated by the reflection and refraction of light on its surface, which is a common characteristic of transparent curved surfaces like those found on glass domes.",
