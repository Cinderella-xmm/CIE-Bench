      "question": "Is the scene enclosed within a visible wooden shadow box frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly contained within a wooden shadow box frame. This is evident from the visible wooden borders surrounding the entire image, giving an impression that the visual elements inside are contained within a box-like display. This framing creates a distinct boundary differentiating the interior scene from its exterior environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the tree been scaled down in size and rendered with enhanced 3D surface texture (e.g., visible bark details, depth, shading)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree appears to have been scaled down to fit within the confines of a shadow box. It exhibits a significant level of 3D detailing, as evident in the textured surface of the tree bark and the arrangement of foliage, which suggests depth and realistic shading. These characteristics are indicative of enhanced 3D rendering often used in model displays.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible, distinct patches of multi-colored flowers (e.g., pink, yellow, blue, red) beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are distinct and vividly colored patches of flowers beneath the tree. These are clearly visible and come in a variety of colors such as pink, yellow, blue, and red. Their arrangement in small patches is typical of decorative floral displays within an enclosed box environment, contributing to the aesthetic of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background consist of multiple layered painted surfaces that create a sense of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of painted surfaces that appear to have layers depicting a sky with clouds and hills. However, they are painted on a single flat surface without any additional layered components, which results in a more simplified representation rather than creating an integrated sense of depth through layers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, detailed cloud shapes visibly suspended by thin wires above or within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are small white cloud shapes visible in the upper section of the shadow box. These clouds are suspended by thin wires, which are visible upon close inspection. This suggests a deliberate attempt to create a layered and dynamic visual effect within the confined space of the box.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image include surreal or stylized elements (e.g., floating clouds, soft glow, pastel hues) that contribute to a whimsical and dreamlike atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of suspended clouds and the bright, vivid colors contributes to a whimsical effect. The overall design with stylized elements such as the decorative arrangement of flowers and the simplified cartoon-like tree gives the scene a playful, dreamlike quality. However, compared to surreal ambiance, the creative elements are more akin to a toy-like or model-like atmosphere rather than deeply surreal.",
