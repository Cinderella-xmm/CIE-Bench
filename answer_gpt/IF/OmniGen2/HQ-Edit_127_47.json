      "question": "Is the entire forest lake scene enclosed within a visible spherical glass orb?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the forest lake scene is encapsulated inside a transparent, spherical object which is indicative of a glass orb. The spherical shape and the reflection on the surface are visual cues indicating it's a glass orb. The scene is self-contained within this orb, meaning the entire depiction is within the glass sphere.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the ducks been replaced with 3D models that have a glossy, reflective surface finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ducks in Image B appear to be polished and reflective, lacking the natural textures found in real ducks. They have a uniform, shiny surface typical of 3D models crafted with a lustrous finish, indicating that these ducks are not real but 3D representations with a glossy surface.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the water feature layered resin-like textures and transparent materials that enhance depth and clarity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water in Image B appears very clear, with a distinct layered appearance commonly found in resin artworks. The transparency and visual depth indicate it's not natural water but a crafted representation using materials like resin to give it a structured, artistic quality.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene inside the glass orb includes small-scale items and environmental details. However, the visible elements mainly consist of the ducks and surrounding natural features. There are no visible miniature figurines of woodland animals like deer among these elements inside the orb.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the glass orb positioned on a base that has visible wooden textures. The surface displays grain patterns typically associated with natural wood, emphasizing a handcrafted, organic appearance often seen in wooden items.",
