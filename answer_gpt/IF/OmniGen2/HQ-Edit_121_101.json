    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image presented as a series of separate stamp-like elements arranged in a grid or collection format, each resembling a paper-cut design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are individual sections displaying distinct buildings and motifs, looking like separate stamp elements. The designs have a paper-cut aesthetic with clear borders, consistent with stamp collections. The red borders and symmetrical layout further support this format.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral embroidery details on the hanbok enhanced with visible metallic foil effects (e.g., shiny, reflective highlights)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B presents illustrations with simplified designs that lack the texture or material-specific details like shine or reflections found in foil. The hanbok design seems flat and stylized, mimicking paper cut-outs without emphasizing material properties such as metallic foil effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the bow on the hanbok been visibly enlarged compared to its original size in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow on the hanbok is represented as a separate element entirely and appears standardized alongside the rest of the stamped elements. Without the actual object from Image A for direct comparison in size, the bow doesn't appear exaggeratedly large; it is proportionate to its compartment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the traditional Korean architectural background clearly visible and properly integrated into the overall composition of the stamp series?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays sections featuring Korean architecture, clearly illustrated as part of the unified theme across these stamp-like elements. The buildings form a consistent and visually organized part of the collection, emphasizing their integration within the stamp series.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire stamp series displayed on a surface that resembles embossed leather with visible texture and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stamp series appears to be mounted on a background with a brown coloration and subtle texture resembling leather. The edges have shadowing effects that suggest depth, similar to embossed leather surfaces.",
