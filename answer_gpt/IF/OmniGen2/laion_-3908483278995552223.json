        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Aquatic warrior character appears to have depth and volume, which are characteristics of three-dimensional rendering. This can be seen in the way the light interacts with different surfaces, casting shadows and highlights that suggest a 3D form rather than a flat 2D surface.",
