      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the horse visibly composed of distinct 3D puzzle pieces with defined edges separating each section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse appears as a singular, smooth piece with painted floral patterns. There are no visible sections or defined edges indicating puzzle pieces, suggesting it is intact rather than assembled from separate parts. World knowledge about puzzle pieces suggests they usually have noticeable seams or edges where they connect, which are absent here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the horse enclosed within a wooden-framed display case that has a transparent glass dome covering it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the horse inside a transparent glass dome display case, resting on what appears to be a potentially wooden base. However, there is no visible wooden frame around this dome; it appears clear and seamlessly connected to the base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the display case rest on a textured wooden base that shows natural wood grain or carving details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base on which the display case rests does not exhibit visible wood grain or traditional carving details indicative of natural wood. The base appears smooth with a uniform texture, lacking artisanal wood characteristics. Understanding wood textures suggests natural wood often shows irregular grain or carved patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the intricate floral patterns on the horse fragmented across individual puzzle sections, with no single piece showing a complete motif?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns on the horse in Image B are painted as holistic designs without segmentation indicative of puzzle pieces. Each motif is complete, covering a broad part of the horse uniformly, rather than fragmented across sections.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a vintage-style compass located at the front of the base beneath the glass dome. The compass appears decorative and is embedded within the smooth casing of the base. World knowledge about compasses suggests their symbolic placement in decorative objects serves aesthetic purposes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible antique-brass colored accents such as hinges, trim, or fixtures on the display case or base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no accessories like antique-brass colored hinges, trim, or fixtures visible on the display case or its base. The case and base appear simple and uniform without additional metallic accents often used for ornamental purposes.",
