      "question": "Has the floral headdress been transformed into a chibi-style headpiece with exaggerated, rounded, and simplified forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral headdress in Image B appears to exhibit increased stylization compared to Image A, featuring vibrant colors and symmetrical, rounded flower forms, typical of chibi-style design. The use of accentuated and simplified petals suggests a transformation into a chibi-style headpiece.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the orange and yellow flowers in the headpiece rendered with vivid, saturated hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers are presented with intense, vivid colors, indicative of saturated hues. This contrasts Image A, where the colors appear more natural and subdued. Such vibrant coloration aligns with chibi-style aesthetics.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the black, orange, and yellow braided hair been integrated into the chibi-style headpiece as part of its design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair braids exhibit a stylized appearance, closely integrated with the headpiece design, reflecting typical chibi-style aesthetics: simple, bold designs with consistent color integration. Image A displays somewhat realistic hair braiding, absent in chibi-style.",

      "question": "Have the earrings been transformed into small, golden, chibi-style charms that retain the original lace-like pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The earrings in Image B exhibit small, golden forms, consistent with the original lace-like structure seen in Image A. Given their simplified, yet detailed appearance closely resembling original design, they achieve a balance between chibi-style and original lace pattern.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the earrings are clearly comprised within overall attire, yet do not appear physically attached to the headpiece. Instead, they are comfortably positioned adjacent to it, mirroring visibility without attachment dynamics featured in Image A.",
