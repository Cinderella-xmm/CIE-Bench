    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image presented as a three-dimensional shadow box diorama with visible depth created by layered components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually resembles a three-dimensional shadow box diorama. This conclusion is drawn from the visible intersecting layers and depth presented in the display. Shadow boxes often contain layered objects to portray depth and create a multi-dimensional scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the skyline and foreground elements visibly separated into multiple layered paper cut-out sections to simulate depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyline and foreground elements appear to be displayed in different layers. The apparent separation between the skyline, trees, and the Eiffel Tower foreground suggests the use of paper cut-out layers. This technique gives the appearance of depth within the diorama.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the grassy lawn area been replaced with a reflective, mirror-like surface that shows reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a distinct, reflective surface resembling a mirror where the grassy lawn originally appeared. The depiction includes reflections of figures, indicating the panel has a mirror-like reflective quality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there numerous small, detailed, three-dimensional-looking pedestrian figures scattered throughout the scene, particularly on pathways and near the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only a few figures are visible, and they have a flat appearance consistent with layered paper cut-outs, rather than looking detailed or three-dimensional. This observation suggests these elements are not scattered or numerous.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene framed by a dark border with visible metallic edges, consistent with a shadow box enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is clearly encased in a dark frame with metallic-looking edges, giving it the appearance of a shadow box, which traditionally involves framing to create depth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are city names and geographic coordinates visibly engraved along the outer edge of the frame in fine detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text on Image B's frame consists of indecipherable characters, instead of recognizable city names or geographic coordinates engraved with precision. This indicates the lack of a specific textual engraving as might be expected.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
