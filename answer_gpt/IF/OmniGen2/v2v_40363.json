      "question": "Is the entire image composed of small, distinct mosaic tiles with visible grout lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface is made up of small, square shapes that are distinct from each other and separated by thin lines, which are commonly referred to as grout lines in mosaic artwork. This visual cue strongly indicates that the entire image is composed of mosaic tiles. By recognizing the typical features of mosaics, such as being crafted from small, evenly-sized pieces, it can be concluded that the image indeed consists of mosaic tiles.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image vivid and saturated, particularly the red heart balloon and the child's features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors appear bright and vivid with a strong contrast, particularly noticeable in the red heart balloons and the child's blue shirt, which suggests high saturation. Vivid colors are a typical characteristic of mosaic art when individual tiles are used to create a vibrant composition. Observations confirm that mosaic tiles often showcase such bright and vivid colors, reaffirming the conclusion.",

      "question": "Are the outlines of the heart balloon and the child clearly defined and emphasized in the mosaic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features distinct outlines for both the heart balloons and the child’s features, which stand out against the tiles' background. This clarity is a result of deliberate color choices and the placement of the tiles, providing a sharp definition typical within mosaic artworks. Such well-defined and emphasized outlines indicate the precision required in mosaic art to convey clear images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the overall composition and all essential elements from the original image been maintained in the mosaic version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A reveals that the core elements—such as the child and the heart balloons—remain consistent, despite the change in artistic medium from a typical mural to mosaic. The composition, including the arrangement of elements, is retained in full. The transition to a mosaic format successfully preserves the original imagery while adhering to the constraints of the medium.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the material of the artwork reflect the characteristics of ceramic mosaic tiles, such as a glossy or matte finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B’s surface features a reflective quality, indicating a gloss which is typical of ceramic mosaic tiles. This is seen in how the light appears to shine on the tiles, particularly on areas of uniform color, and such glossy finishes are common in ceramic works to enhance color vibrancy and surface protection.",
