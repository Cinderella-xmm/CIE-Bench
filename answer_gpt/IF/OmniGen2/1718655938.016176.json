      "question": "Does the edited image display a cartoonish or animated visual style with exaggerated proportions and simplified forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements exhibit a style consistent with animation or cartoons. The colors are bright and the shapes are simple and exaggerated, which is characteristic of a cartoonish style. The trees have been depicted in a prominent way with exaggerated shapes, and the churchâ€™s structure is simplified, contributing to the overall cartoonish or animated appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the outlines of the church simplified and exaggerated, with bold lines and minimal fine architectural detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church shows simplified outlines with bold lines. The architectural details are minimal, focusing less on realism and more on stylized depiction, which supports the cartoonish design theme. This differs from Image A, where the church is depicted with more realistic details and textures.",

      "question": "Do the stained-glass windows feature bright, colorful, and stylized patterns that differ from realistic depictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the stained-glass windows with bright colors and stylized patterns that are not aiming for realism but rather a colorful artistic expression. This contrasts with Image A where the stained-glass windows maintain a more realistic approach to color and design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have all pine trees been replaced with objects resembling candy, such as lollipops, gumdrops, or striped candies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pine trees remain present in the scene, depicted in a stylized cartoonish manner but not replaced with candy-like objects. This stays true to the original composition shown in Image A, where the trees are a significant part of the background.",

      "question": "Is the sky composed of a swirling, pastel-colored patchwork quilt pattern rather than a natural twilight sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a sky with stylized elements like bright circular highlights and color gradients, creating a whimsical atmosphere. However, these elements do not form a quilt pattern; rather, they accentuate the cartoon style. Image A shows a natural twilight sky, focusing on a warm gradient with starry details.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the central positioning of the church along a winding path, which is surrounded by a stylized forest environment. This setup is consistent with Image A, where the path and central position create a visual focal point.",
