      "question": "Is the Eiffel Tower depicted as a fantasy beacon emitting mystical energy rather than a standard metallic structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower has been transformed with fantastical elements. The structure emits a radiant glow, visible as energetic orbs and light streams surrounding it, giving the impression of magical energy.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows modifications to the Eiffel Tower where its lattice structure includes glowing floral motifs. The visual presentation of these elements with luminescence and varied colors differentiates them from standard metal structures and suggests enchantment.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the Eiffel Tower features a large, crystal-like structure. This replaces the traditional metal tip of the tower, offering a fantastical element that enhances the mystical appearance, evident from its bright glow and geometric shape not characteristic of standard tower architecture.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the base of the tower, there is a stone platform with engraved symbols. This design is distinctly different from the usual Eiffel Tower surroundings and resembles ancient or arcane styles, suggesting a replacement of what is typically a grassy or urban area.",
