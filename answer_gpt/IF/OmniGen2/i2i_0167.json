      "question": "Does the edited image include the apple's current front view as originally shown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the top left quadrant displays an apple from the front view, which closely resembles the original Image A's view. Visually, both images depict a similar perspective of an apple seen from the front, which is a key characteristic of such a view. This analysis concludes that the edited image retains the front view of the apple as in the original image.",

      "question": "Is there a cross-section view of the apple that shows its inner flesh texture and seeds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom left and bottom right quadrants display a cross-section of the apple, revealing the inner flesh and seeds, which are essential components seen in an apple's cross-section. This visualization confirms the presence of a cross-section view showing these internal details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image contain a top view that clearly displays the apple's stem structure and calyx area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A top view typically displays the stem's structure from above, which is not present in Image B. The views in Image B include front and cross-sectional views only. None of these views offer a direct top view perspective showing both stem and calyx details.",

      "question": "Has the current front view of the apple remained unchanged compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the original Image A and the top left section of Image B, both images display a front view of a similar-looking apple. The edited image's front view section exhibits similar lighting and shape, maintaining consistency with the original view.",

      "question": "Does the cross-section of the apple reveal both the flesh texture and seeds accurately?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cross-sections (bottom left and right) show the apple's interior, including the white flesh and centrally located seeds. These elements are typical in a real apple, accurately reflected in the depiction, indicating an effort to represent these features realistically.",
