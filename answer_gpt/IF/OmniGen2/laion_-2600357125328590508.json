    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sock fully constructed from visible interlocking LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sock-like object that retains the smooth and seamless appearance of a textile material. There are no visible interlocking LEGO-style bricks; instead, the sock's surface looks knitted or woven, typical of fabric rather than constructed brick by brick.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original black, gray, and white patterns of the sock retained using blocky LEGO brick shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the original color patterns of the sock, but these patterns are not expressed through LEGO brick shapes. The aesthetic of the sock is that of a typical fabric with a printed design rather than constructed using blocky LEGO brick shapes which would usually create a pixelated look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sculpture exhibit layered, three-dimensional construction with varying brick heights to create depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sock appears as a flat, single-layered object similar to ordinary socks. There is no evidence of three-dimensional construction or varying heights as would be expected in a sculpture constructed with bricks or blocks to create depth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tag at the top of the sculpture an orange LEGO brick piece?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orange tag visible at the top of the sock in Image B appears to be a fabric tag stitched onto the sock. Its texture and shape are consistent with a piece of fabric rather than a LEGO brick which would have a more defined and hard-edged structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sculpture displayed upright in a clean, minimalist gallery-like environment with no clutter or distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the sock against a simple and uncluttered background, which is light-colored and non-distracting. This kind of presentation is typical of a minimalist environment, emphasizing focus on the object itself without additional elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the sculpture display clear architectural detail such as aligned brick rows, defined edges, and intentional structural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sock observed in Image B does not exhibit architectural details typical of a structure built with bricks. There are no aligned rows or defined edges characteristic of LEGO constructions. The sock maintains the smooth and organic form typical of fabric material rather than a rigid structural form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
