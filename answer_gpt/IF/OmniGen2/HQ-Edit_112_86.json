      "question": "Is the main body of the teapot made of clear glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a teapot with a body that appears to be made of clear glass, as evidenced by its transparency and reflections. The light passes through the main body, suggesting it is made of clear glass. This is a visual cue indicating the teapot is not opaque or metallic like other materials.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the body of the teapot transparent, allowing visibility through it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main body of the teapot is transparent, allowing light and reflections to pass through, which is characteristic of transparent glass. This indicates visibility through the teapot, allowing us to see patterns and reflections clearly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there frosted floral patterns on the surface of the teapot that resemble the original engraved rose and leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teapot in Image B features floral patterns that appear frosted or etched onto the surface. These patterns closely resemble engraved designs, similar to the rose and leaves seen in traditional engraved metal objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the handle and spout made of tinted amber glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle and spout of the teapot in Image B have a distinct amber tint. This suggests they are made of tinted amber glass, given their color and translucent appearance which is typical of glass materials when tinted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored surface showing a clear reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is positioned on a surface that shows a clear reflection beneath it. This indicates that the surface is highly reflective, akin to a mirrored surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the floral patterns on the teapot retain the same level of detail and design as the original engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns on the teapot in Image B appear intricate and maintain a high level of detail similar to traditional engravings found in metalwork. The frosted patterns capture the complexity and beauty akin to the original designs.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the teapot retain the original shape and proportions of the original metallic version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparing Image B with Image A, the teapot retains the same shape and proportions as seen in the original metallic version. The spout, handle, and overall form appear consistent between both images, even though the materials differ.",
