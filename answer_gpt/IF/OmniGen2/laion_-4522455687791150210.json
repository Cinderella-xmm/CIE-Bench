    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the woman depicted as a marble statue rather than a living person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's entire form, including the skin and the pedestal, appears to be made of marble, which gives it a solid and lifeless quality typical of statues. This visual cue is consistent with how marble statues are traditionally rendered in classical art.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figure in an elegant, balanced standing pose characteristic of classical sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue's stance exhibits an elegant and balanced pose, where the weight is shifted onto one leg while the other leg is slightly bent. This is reminiscent of classical sculpture poses, which often aim to convey harmony and grace.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the folds of the saree intricately detailed and rendered to suggest movement and flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The saree in Image B is depicted with detailed folds and drapery, creating a sense of movement and flow. This level of detail mirrors the artistic techniques seen in classical sculptures, where fabric is carved to appear as if it is gently flowing or affected by gravity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a classical-style pedestal beneath the statue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is mounted on a distinct pedestal that is rectangular and made of what appears to be marble, consistent with classical statue displays. This type of base is typical in galleries and historical settings to support and elevate sculptures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the saree entirely rendered in marble texture, including patterns and borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the saree, while depicted on a marble statue, retains the original colors, patterns, and intricate details instead of adopting a marble texture. This suggests that only the statue's base and body (skin) have the marble finish, while the saree itself maintains a textile appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the necklace and earrings represented as engraved or incised details on the marble surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jewelry appears to have a colored, realistic finish rather than being simply incised or engraved onto the marble. This indicates that the necklace and earrings are not represented purely as part of the marble surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the statue placed within an ornate palace hall featuring classical architecture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B shows an interior space with tall marble columns and intricate moldings, elements typical of classical architecture, supporting the setting of an ornate palace hall.",
