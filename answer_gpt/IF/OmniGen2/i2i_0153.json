      "question": "Has the image been converted into a realistic cartoon rendering style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck and scenery appear to be drawn in a cartoon style with bold outlines, simplified details, and flat, vivid colors. This cartoon style makes the truck and background more stylized and less detailed than in real life, indicating a conversion into a cartoon rendering style. The lines are crisp, with defined shapes and colors, which are typical of cartoon illustrations.",

      "question": "Does the truck retain its original structure in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the truckâ€™s overall structure, including its shape, components, and design features like the grill, headlights, and exhaust pipes, appears consistent. While the style and details in Image B have been simplified into a cartoon format, the fundamental structure and proportions seem to be preserved.",

      "question": "Are the lines in the truck bolder compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is depicted in a cartoon style which typically uses thick, prominent outlines to define shapes and forms more clearly. In contrast, Image A, being realistic, has softer and less defined transitions because real-life objects have gradients and natural transitions that don't exist in cartoons.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are bright and saturated, which is characteristic of a cartoon style, providing a more energetic and eye-catching appearance. In contrast, Image A has more subdued and realistic color tones, reflecting natural lighting and shading.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon background with simplified shapes and less intricate detail. Trees, clouds, and vegetation are represented with basic outlines and colors. This is in contrast to Image A, where the trees and clouds have more texture and detailing, consistent with a realistic scene.",
