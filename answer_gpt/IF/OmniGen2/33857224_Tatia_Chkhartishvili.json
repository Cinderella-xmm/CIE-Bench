        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a character with an oversized head relative to the body, a characteristic common in cartoon or chibi-style designs. This style exaggerates features to create a cute or playful aesthetic, often used in caricatures or animated figures.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the character with bold black outlines that are characteristic of a toy-like or cartoonish appearance. These outlines help define the shape of the character, similar to a rubber toy, making the features stand out against the background.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the character is shown bending over with her torso leaned downward towards her legs, although in Image B, this is more stylized and exaggerated, typical of cartoon character design to emphasize the pose.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

The new background setting aligns with the concept of isolating the character for display, such as in product photography for a keychain.",
