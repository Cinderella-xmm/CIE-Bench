      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the carrot now growing inside a space greenhouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot is inside a structure with a metal frame and curved glass panels, which resembles the design of greenhouses often used in controlled environments such as space habitats. This visual cue leads to the conclusion that the carrot is now growing inside a space greenhouse.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image include a metallic climate-controlled cultivation chamber surrounding the carrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metal structure around the carrot in Image B, which could serve as a climate-controlled chamber for cultivating plants, suggests that the carrot is housed in such a chamber. The metallic and glass structure is a typical design feature for these types of cultivation environments.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the carrot now rooted in synthetic substrate instead of natural soil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the substrate still appears to be natural soil because it has a similar texture and appearance to that typically found in outdoor soil environments, rather than man-made synthetic substrates which might often look more uniform or artificial.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the carrot appear visibly rooted in the synthetic substrate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As the substrate in Image B continues to resemble natural soil with its texture and irregular clumps, rather than an evenly textured synthetic alternative, it does not appear to be synthetic substrate. Thus, the carrot does not appear visibly rooted in synthetic substrate.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has all evidence of the original outdoor garden environment been removed from the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of the metallic greenhouse structure does suggest a change of environment, but there are still plants visible and soil that resembles a natural garden setting. These elements indicate that not all evidence of the original outdoor garden environment has been completely removed.",
