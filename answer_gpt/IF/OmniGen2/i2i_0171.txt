    "Question": "Q1: Does the figurine maintain the skier's exact pose from the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine appears to be skiing downhill, but unlike the dynamic turning action depicted in Image A, the figurine's stance is more upright and straightforward. In Image A, the skier is captured in a deep turn, creating a sense of dynamic movement, which is not mirrored by the figurine's pose in Image B, which appears more stable and lacks the dynamic carving action.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the skis designed to be detachable from the figurine?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, alongside the figurine, there appears to be a separate set of skis depicted next to it, suggesting the skis can be detached. This is not a common feature in standard action figures unless specifically designed for customization or display purposes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the figurine include details like ski poles and a backpack if they were part of the skier's original pose?",
