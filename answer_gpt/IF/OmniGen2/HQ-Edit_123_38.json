        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, it appears to be a single-panel presentation without indicators of being part of a multi-panel postcard set. The text and decorative motifs suggest a standalone design rather than an assembled set.",

      ],
