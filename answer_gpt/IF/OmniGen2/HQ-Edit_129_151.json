        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the art style is reminiscent of Japanese woodblock prints (Ukiyo-e) due to its flat colors and strong outlines.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is stylized and less focused on intricate details. The trees and pond are present but are depicted in a more simplified and illustrative style.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B leans towards flat colors seen in traditional prints rather than deep or subtle hues. The image uses bright and noticeable colors due to its illustrative nature. This choice of colors diverges from a harmonious and natural palette composed of deep greens, earthy browns, and subtle grays.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
