    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the boot transformed into a sculpture-like object with a rigid, stylized structure consistent with Art Deco aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a boot with a polished, reflective surface and distinct, structured lines, giving it a sculpture-like appearance. The structured form and shine align with the Art Deco style, known for its emphasis on form and geometry. The overall aesthetic transformation gives the boot a rigid and stylized appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the embroidered floral patterns replaced with geometric designs such as zigzags, chevrons, or sunburst motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns appear more structured and geometric compared to typical floral motifs. While not precisely zigzags or sunbursts, they are more geometric in nature than floral, which fits within a geometric design transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the decorative elements on the boot have a metallic sheen and appear as inlaid metal plates or strips rather than stitched leather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boot in Image B has a significant metallic sheen, suggesting that the decorative elements look more like inlaid metal. This is indicative of metal-like strips or plates as opposed to traditional stitched leather, making them seem reflective and metallic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the heel been redesigned into a stepped, multi-tiered architectural shape with sharp angles and vertical emphasis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The heel in Image B has been transformed into a more polished and smooth form. However, it lacks the explicit multi-tiered, stepped architecture or sharp angles indicative of a radical redesign. It still maintains a traditional boot heel structure rather than an architecturally complex one.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the boot surface exhibit a hard, reflective, non-leather-like finish consistent with metal or polished stone, indicating a sculptural material change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boot in Image B exhibits a very reflective surface, consistent with the appearance of metal or polished stone. The high shine and smooth appearance suggest a shift away from a leather finish, indicating a material change to something more sculptural and reflective.",
