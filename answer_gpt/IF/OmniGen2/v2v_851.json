      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typography appears to be bold and slightly imperfect, giving off a rustic or handmade feel. This is often intentional in designs meant to convey an element of authenticity or tradition, which matches the rustic theme.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
