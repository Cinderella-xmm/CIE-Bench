      "question": "Is the cat's body now composed of a fluffy, mist-like substance with a sky-blue hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower half of the cat's body is depicted sitting on a cloud with a sky-blue hue, giving it a fluffy and mist-like appearance. This differs from the original Image A, where the cat's body is solid and multi-colored. Based on the mist-like depiction and color in Image B, the cat's body gives the impression of being more ethereal compared to Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the knitted cap been replaced with a swirling cumulus cloud cluster on top of the cat's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts cloud formations surrounding where the head might be located, implying a cloud-like presence above it. In Image A, the cat wears a knitted cap that's solid and textured. In Image B, there is a cloud design without the traditional knitted cap, suggesting it has been replaced.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible cloud-like patterns woven into the cat’s misty body, such as soft streaks or wisps resembling fog or cirrus clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the cat's body involves sitting on a cloud, reinforcing the cloud-like theme. This includes the presence of a cloud around the body. Unlike Image A, which features a solid-striped appearance, Image B emphasizes a cloud motif.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the cat have small, translucent wings with faint, swirling cloud patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible light blue wings attached to the cat's upper body, resembling the texture and look of clouds. These are absent in Image A, where the cat does not display any wings. The presence of wings in Image B suggests an ethereal theme consistent with clouds.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cat’s eyes decorated with gentle, swirling patterns resembling breezes or vapor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurring of the face, the specific details of the eyes in Image B cannot be confirmed or analyzed in terms of swirling patterns or decorations. Therefore, the question remains unanswered regarding visible patterns resembling vapor or breeze in the eyes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible vapor trails extending along the cat’s body, particularly from its tail or limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction centers on a cloud motif but does not specifically show elongated vapor trails extending from the cat's body parts like the tail or limbs. It seems more encompassed in a cloud-like presence rather than having specific trails.",
