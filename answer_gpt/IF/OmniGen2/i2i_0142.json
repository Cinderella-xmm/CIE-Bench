      "question": "Is there a top view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the baseball appears from a frontal perspective, emphasizing its round shape and distinct red stitching. The glove is shown from an angle that displays the inside, looking into where the hand would be placed. These views are not strictly top views, which would show the top surfaces of the objects from directly above.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a side view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the baseballs are represented in a way that shows both their roundness and stitching, but not from a traditional side view which would be oriented orthogonally to the top or bottom of a sphere. The glove's angle also does not represent a true side view but rather a frontal interior view emphasizing the pocket and finger openings of the glove.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a sectional view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A sectional view typically involves cutting through an object to reveal its interior structure. The edited image shows external and complete depictions of baseballs and a glove without any indication of internal structure being exposed or sectioned.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the views of the baseball and glove clear and detailed enough for product catalogs or sports equipment manuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features well-detailed and clean images of two baseballs and a glove. The clarity, emphasis on texture, color, and essential characteristics, such as stitching and the structure of the glove, would make these views suitable for illustrations in product catalogs or manuals that require clear visual references.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors and textures of the baseball and glove accurately preserved in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the baseball's off-white color and red stitching, along with the gloveâ€™s brown leather and black lacing, are vividly detailed, portraying realistic textures and colors. These features create a realistic depiction that appears accurate for visual representations, maintaining true-to-life color and texture in each view.",
