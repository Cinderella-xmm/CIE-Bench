      "question": "Does the scene appear as a digitally rendered holographic installation with visible projection-like effects such as transparency, layering, or digital glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits characteristics commonly associated with digital renderings and holographic installations. The vibrant and surreal colors, along with the glowing elements, suggest digital modifications. The overall scene appears to be an artificially designed artistic representation rather than a natural environment, indicated by the apparent electronic glow and structure of the trees and waterfall. These visual cues imply the use of digital projection and layering techniques.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls depicted as animated light projections on transparent or reflective glass surfaces instead of natural flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfall is represented by a bright, luminous column of light, which contrasts starkly with a natural flow of water seen in typical environments. The straightness and uniform brilliance of the waterfall suggest that it might be a light projection rather than actual water, hinting at its creation through digital rendering on reflective surfaces rather than a photograph of a real waterfall.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trees feature visible iridescent, glowing filaments resembling fiber optics embedded within their trunks and branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B have distinct trunks with colorful, bright strands that closely resemble fiber optics. These iridescent, glowing filaments embedded within the trees suggest an artificial and digitally manipulated depiction. This appearance is unlikely in natural settings, reinforcing the idea that the trees are part of a synthetic, technological interpretation of nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the vines appear as virtualized, looping structures with light trails or animated effects, forming a kinetic light sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B doesn't prominently feature vines in the way they are typically portrayed in natural environments, the overall style of the plants and trees, with their dynamic light strands and glowing presence, suggests a virtual and digitally animated form. If vines were present, they would likely exhibit similar digital artistry and kinetic effects, in line with the other elements in the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the environment integrated with futuristic architectural elements such as glass panels, geometric structures, or artificial lighting that blend with the natural forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B heavily features elements suggestive of futuristic design, such as the glowing light columns and the structured bases of the trees that resemble a blend of natural and artificial architecture. The use of vivid, artificial lighting and orderly, well-lit sections suggests an integration of architectural and artificial elements, offering a vision of nature fused with futuristic design.",
