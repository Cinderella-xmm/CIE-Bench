      "question": "Are the kimono and fox mask rendered with sharp geometric shapes and angular lines characteristic of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono and fox mask have been rendered with sharp geometric shapes and clean lines. The design is abstract and features angular lines and forms that are characteristic of Art Deco style, which is known for its emphasis on geometric shapes and symmetry. The image uses bold, defined lines to create contrast and emphasize the structured forms of the kimono and mask.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the outlines and internal details of both the kimono and the fox mask feature prominent bold lines and angular geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines of both the kimono and the fox mask are marked by prominent bold lines. The internal details, like the areas around the mask and the kimono patterns, have angular and geometric forms. These characteristics give a sense of structure and sharpness to the visual elements, aligning with the angular geometry typical of stylized and simplified designs.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the floral patterns on the kimono been replaced with simplified, abstract, and stylized motifs rather than realistic flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the kimono have been transformed into simplified and stylized motifs. Instead of realistic representations, these motifs appear more abstract and graphic, with a focus on design rather than botanical accuracy. This stylization aligns with a more graphic art style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dominant colors in Image B are primarily deep reds and pale pinks, which are evident in the background and the attire. However, there are no metallic tones like silver or gold present in the image. The colors focus more on warm reds and pinks rather than having an inclusion of metallic shades.",

      "question": "Is the overall composition symmetrically balanced, with harmonious alignment between the kimono and mask, and do the textures appear refined and unified?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B is symmetrically balanced, as evidenced by the equal distribution of elements and the central positioning of the kimono and mask. The harmonious alignment between these elements creates a cohesive visual structure, and the textures appear unified due to the consistent styling and rendering techniques.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the transformation into a more geometric and stylized form, the silhouette and proportions of the person’s body, kimono, and mask are preserved. The elements are harmonized through consistent scaling and alignment, maintaining the visual integrity of the original form while adopting a new artistic style.",
