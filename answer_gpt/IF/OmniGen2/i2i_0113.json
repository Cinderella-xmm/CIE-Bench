      "question": "Is the character presented as a soft vinyl figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character has a stylized, non-realistic appearance with simplified features and a glossy finish, typical of soft vinyl figures or collectible figurines. The overall shape, proportions, and finish suggest it is a toy-like model rather than a realistic depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is visibly positioned on a circular base, which is colored black. This is a common feature for figurines, as it provides stability for display purposes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character holding a weapon. However, there is no indication that this weapon is an interchangeable accessory. The figure does not display any visible mechanism for changing or swapping out pieces, which is typically present in interchangeable sets.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's hands are realistically sculpted, but there is no visible indication that different hand gestures are interchangeable. The figure appears to have fixed hands, as there are no visible joints or additional hand pieces depicted.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images display a character with a similar style costume, red hair, and other consistent features, despite the stylized and toy-like appearance of Image B. These elements indicate that the figure retains recognizable features from Image A, despite the medium change.",
