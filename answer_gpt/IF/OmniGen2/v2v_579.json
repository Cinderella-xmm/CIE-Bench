      "question": "Has the central green block been converted into a 3D chibi-style cartoon character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central green block has been transformed into a 3D chibi-style character with cartoonish features such as large eyes and a smiling mouth. This is a departure from its original simple block form in Image A. The transformation from a simple block to a character suggests a shift towards a playful and anthropomorphic design, which is characteristic of chibi-style art.",

      "question": "Have the red blocks been redesigned as lively supporting characters with charming, playful expressions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the red blocks as characters with facial features such as eyes and smiling mouths, giving them lively, animated appearances compared to the plain red blocks in Image A. The addition of facial expressions and a cohesive theme aligns with the design of playful supporting characters often seen in animation or children's toys.",

      "question": "Has the environment been transformed into a romantic proposal scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting includes heart-shaped confetti and a warm-colored backdrop, elements that are often associated with romantic themes. The characters are arranged in a way that could suggest a gathering or an occasion, but there are no explicit elements indicating a proposal such as rings or a specific celebratory gesture. Although the setting is romantic and celebratory, without clearer symbols of a proposal, it cannot be definitively considered a proposal scene.",

      "question": "Has the background been updated with soft pastel colors and realistic textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features soft pastel pinks and other warm colors, with a simplified backdrop that serves to highlight the animated blocks. While the colors are soft and pastel-like, realistic textures are not distinctly present, as the background tends more towards an illustrated style consistent with the cartoon theme of the blocks.",

      "question": "Is heart-shaped confetti sprinkled throughout the setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible pieces of heart-shaped confetti spread around the setting, adding to the playful and festive atmosphere. This is in direct contrast to Image A, where no such elements were present. The presence of heart-shaped confetti contributes to the whimsical and joyful theme depicted in Image B.",
