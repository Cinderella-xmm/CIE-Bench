      "question": "Does the edited image depict the medieval structure as a colossal stone golem with a humanoid form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image shows a large humanoid figure with a crown-like object resembling a golem. The shape of the figure and its features suggest a humanoid form, differentiated from the medieval architecture seen in Image A. This transformation uses visual cues, such as the muscular limbs and overall silhouette associated with golems in mythology or fantasy.",

      "question": "Are the archways visibly transformed into articulated limbs resembling arms or legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B does not clearly show the archways transformed into limbs resembling arms or legs. The arches remain architectural elements without the articulation typical of limbs. They don't appear modified into any form that emulates limbs in a humanoid figure.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the battlements at the top of the structure resemble a crown-like shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited representation of the battlements indeed resembles a crown sitting atop the humanoid figure's head. This visual transformation utilizes the silhouettes of the battlements, adapting their structure to conform to the crown-like shape, fitting over the head of the golem form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no distinct visual elements evident that suggest glowing ancient glyphs on the surface of the structure or the figure. The walls of the structure largely maintain their texture without transformation into glyphs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does feature a golem-like silhouette against the bright sky backdrop. However, there is no distinct mystical aura visibly emanating from its shadowed areas. The figure itself retains a solid form without any visible magical effects radiating from shadow regions.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible ethereal effects such as soft glows, light particles, or magical ambiance added to the scene?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows ethereal effects like glowing elements and a luminous aura surrounding the wisp-like entity. These visual additions lend a magical ambiance to the scene, differentiating it from the original image, which lacks such supernatural enhancements.",
