    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image framed with a vintage-style border typical of playing cards?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the border is consistent with the classic design typical of playing cards, with ornate details and patterns commonly found in vintage cards. This is visible as a decorative lining around the edges of the card.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the grape clusters feature visible golden highlights on their surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays grape clusters that have a distinctly golden hue with visible highlights, indicating a polished, shiny appearance. The color composition points to a deliberate artistic choice to create a golden effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the cane been transformed into a design resembling a twisted vine with organic, plant-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of a large singular grape cluster and vine art rather than a cane, indicating a shift from a real object to a stylized design of grapevines. This suggests a transformation in concept towards a nature-themed art piece.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there faint ornate filigree patterns visible within the fabric of the manâ€™s suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a man's suit; instead, it features a stylized grape cluster card. Any observation of filigree patterns in Image B would be incongruent with the transition to playing card design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are vineyard-themed symbols present in one or more corners of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, grape clusters and a singular leaf are prominent elements, indicative of vineyard themes. However, these symbols are central to the design rather than placed in the corners as thematic markers usually would be on playing cards.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image maintain an overall color palette dominated by earthy tones such as browns, greens, and deep reds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a playing card design predominantly using shades of golden brown and with minor black accents, which diverges from a diverse earthy palette that includes greens and deep reds typically found in vineyard imagery.",

      "model_answer": "No",
