      "question": "Has the overall shape and structure of the car been redesigned to resemble a high-performance gaming controller?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car features a sleek and aerodynamic design typical of performance sports cars. The shape and contours are designed to optimize speed and aerodynamics, resembling a sports car rather than a gaming controller. Common gaming controllers have flattened, ergonomic shapes for easy handheld use which differ significantly from the design of this car. Hence, the car's design does not conform to the typical form of a gaming controller.",

      "question": "Have the gullwing doors been redesigned to look like shoulder buttons on a gaming controller?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car doors are presented in a closed position without visible wings, which eliminates the possibility of resembling shoulder buttons typically found on gaming controllers. The design of car doors in Image B appears to follow the traditional form without any indication of resembling gaming elements, including shoulder buttons.",

      "question": "Has the front grille been transformed into a directional pad (D-pad) control layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the front grille as a single piece design typical of performance cars, featuring a sharp and bold design. A directional pad on a gaming controller generally has a cross shape lacking in this grille design. The grille maintains a solid and structured look rather than a segmental layout like a D-pad.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car features a noticeable high glossy finish with visible highlights across its surface, showcasing a distinctly metallic red appearance. Such a finish is common in high-performance vehicles to enhance aesthetic appeal and imply speed. The gloss highlights are evident, reinforcing a vibrant and polished aesthetic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the car from a frontal perspective, obscuring direct visibility to the dashboard. Therefore, based on the visible areas in the image, there is no evidence of dashboard details resembling gaming-themed insignias or button-like controls. The focus is on the exterior design, rather than interior elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hood features a logo that appears distinct and symbolic, consistent with a brand identity rather than a gaming controller element. The circular shape resembles a traditional car emblem rather than a control button, aligning with automotive branding rather than gaming interfaces.",
