      "question": "Is there a visible main cover title that reads \"Ideal Home\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Ideal Home' is prominently displayed at the top center, which aligns with the common practice for cover titles on magazines. This suggests the intention to mimic a magazine cover format with a bold and large font typically used for titles.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible section headings related to home design incorporated into the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While there are multiple texts present on Image B, they do not clearly define sections related to home design. The arrangement and legibility of the text are similar to typical magazine content placement but lack clarity in wording to definitively identify them as section headings related to home design.",

      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a distinct text module present that provides price recommendations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, none of the visible text segments explicitly provides any content resembling price recommendations, which would typically include numbers and currency symbols. The text, while arranged as if to imply magazine-like content, lacks clear financial or pricing information.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the original bedroom setting, including the bed, furniture, and decor, been preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B retains the same bedroom setting as Image A. The bed, furniture, and decor like the picture on the wall and lamps are intact and unchanged. The added text overlay does not alter the foundational elements of the room itself.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the image arranged in a format resembling a magazine cover, with the title, sections, and text modules properly positioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is arranged to mimic a magazine cover: it has a main title at the top center and other text boxes placed in a style typical for magazine layouts. However, the text is mostly unintelligible, which impairs the full coherence typical of professional magazine covers. Despite this readability issue, the intent to resemble a magazine cover layout is evident through the placement of text.",
