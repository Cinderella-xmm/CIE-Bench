      "question": "Is the scene enclosed within a visible decorative glass dome that surrounds the entire diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene is enclosed within a glass dome, which is visually apparent. The dome has a smooth, transparent surface with a rounded top and clear contours, typical of a decorative covering. This visual cue, combined with world knowledge about decorative dioramas or snow globes, supports the presence of such a dome.",

      "question": "Does the snow in the scene have a delicate, powdery texture, appearing soft and lightly settled rather than dense or icy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow appears evenly spread with a fine texture that suggests a soft, powdery consistency. It lightly covers the ground and the trees without forming heavy piles or showing signs of compaction, leading to the conclusion of a delicate, powdery texture.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in Image B are small and stylized, fitting the diorama's miniature scale. Their attire, including long coats and hats, is reminiscent of early 20th-century Parisian fashion, which aligns with the aesthetic of a vintage scene.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the streetlamps are indeed much smaller than those in typical real-world settings, as they match the diorama's scale. They appear to emit a gentle glow, adding charm to the scene and consistent with the soft lighting typical in such displays.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are small and leafless, aligning with the diorama's scale. They have a light dusting of snow on their branches, which accentuates the winter theme without being overly heavy or compact.",
