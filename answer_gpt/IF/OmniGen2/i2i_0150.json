      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the forest background been replaced with a city balcony railing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows a balcony railing and a blurred city skyline, indicating an urban setting, whereas Image A depicts a natural forest environment with foliage. This change in the context of the surroundings suggests a replacement of the background to a city balcony scene in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bird positioned on the sunlit balcony as instructed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is perched on a balcony railing with sunlight illuminating its body, suggesting it is positioned as if it's on a sunlit balcony. This matches the scenario described in the question. In contrast, Image A has the bird on a tree branch in a forest setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a blurred city skyline visible in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes out-of-focus tall buildings consistent with a city skyline, contrasted with the natural forest in Image A, suggesting the presence of a blurred city skyline in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bird maintain its original position relative to the new balcony railing background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B appears to have a similar positioning in relation to the object it is perched on (balcony railing) as it did to the branch in Image A, indicating that its relative positioning was maintained when the background was altered.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting suggests a warm, golden sunlight effect, which is typical for an environment illuminated by the setting or rising sun, consistent with a sunlit balcony atmosphere. This lighting complements the new urban backdrop seen in Image B.",
