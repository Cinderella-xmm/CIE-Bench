    "Question": "Q1: Is the laboratory scientist depicted in a semi-cartoon style with stylized features such as simplified lines or exaggerated proportions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scientist is depicted with simplified lines and exaggerated proportions, characteristic of a semi-cartoon style. This is evident in the poster-like representation where proportions and features are less realistic compared to real-life imagery. The visual style is consistent with illustrations often used for explanatory or promotional purposes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the laboratory apparatus (such as test tubes, microscope, and monitors) rendered with high detail and clarity to emphasize refinement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the laboratory apparatus is depicted in a cartoon-like style rather than a highly detailed, realistic form. The focus is more on stylization than on intricate detail or refinement, which would typically be present in a hyper-detailed rendering.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the dominant colors in the image teal and white, consistent with a sleek scientific aesthetic?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a dominant color scheme of teal and white. The background and various elements of the calendar design maintain a consistent use of these colors, which often evoke a modern and clean scientific aesthetic in graphic design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the image include multiple monthly sections, each featuring a different scientific motif such as molecular structures or data patterns?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts several monthly calendar sections, but they do not each feature distinct scientific motifs like molecular structures or data patterns. The visual elements are more generic and simplified rather than specifically varied per section.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there bold, tech-inspired headers (e.g., futuristic font, glowing or metallic effect) present above each monthly section?",
    "explanation": "Image B does have headers for each monthly section, but they lack bold, tech-inspired characteristics like futuristic fonts or glowing/metallic effects. The headers are colorful but simple, without the dramatic styling that might suggest a tech-inspired design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are data visualization patterns (e.g., circular diagrams, grid layouts, or flowcharts) visibly integrated into the calendar design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, visual elements are present, but they don't resemble complex data visualization patterns such as circular diagrams, grid layouts, or flowcharts. The design remains relatively simple and does not convey the detailed analysis elements typically found in high-level scientific data presentations.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the image display a polished, reflective appearance consistent with high-quality gloss paper?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit characteristics such as a polished or reflective appearance indicative of high-quality gloss paper. The finish is consistent with flat digital artwork and lacks the gloss or sheen typically associated with such paper types.",
    "answer": "No"
