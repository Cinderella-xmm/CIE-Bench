      "question": "Is the door now visually transformed into a mystical guardian creature with distinct animalistic or mythical features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central wooden door has been visually transformed into a figure that resembles a mystical guardian. The structure includes a crowned head, large feathered wings, and a cloak-like garment, which are common characteristics of mythical creatures, such as angels or protectors. This transformation gives the appearance of a living entity rather than just a static door.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there feathered wings extending from the sides of the door, formed by the extension of the original geometric patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are feathered wings visible that extend from the sides of the figure, suggesting a mythical or angelic form. These wings are not a natural extension of the geometric patterns visible in Image A; instead, they are an addition not present in the original image, emphasizing the transformation of the door into a guardian-like entity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the door’s metal knobs been transformed into shimmering, eye-like features with reflective or glowing properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metal knobs on the door are retained; however, they have not been altered to appear as shimmering, eye-like features with reflective or glowing properties. They appear more as decorative armor on the figure rather than adopting any eye-like or glowing characteristics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the arch above the door been transformed into a celestial crown with radiant or star-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arch above the door in Image B has been transformed into a crown on the figure’s head. This addition is symbolic of a celestial or regal theme, implying divinity or supremacy. While the crown contributes to the mythical transformation, the features are not explicitly radiant or star-like.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible etched runes or symbolic inscriptions covering parts of the wooden surface of the transformed creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden surface of the transformed creature appears detailed but does not visibly include etched runes or symbolic inscriptions. The focus seems to be on the transformation of the structure into a robe-like shape rather than adding any additional inscriptions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the doorframe been transformed into a flowing, cloak-like structure that wraps around the creature, resembling a regal garment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the doorframe transformed into a flowing, regal-looking cloak that wraps around the guardian-like figure. This transformation gives the impression of a dress or robe, which contributes to the perception of the door as a living creature rather than just an architectural element.",
