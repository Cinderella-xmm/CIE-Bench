      "question": "Has the Brooklyn Bridge been transformed into a colossal, humanoid stone golem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large, humanoid figure resembling a golem made out of stone, standing prominently in the foreground. This figure is not visible in Image A, where the Brooklyn Bridge is present in its usual form. Thus, in Image B, the structure of the Brooklyn Bridge is visually replaced or obscured by the enormous golem, indicating the transformation mentioned in the question.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the twin spires of the Brooklyn Bridge been reshaped into arms extending from the golem's shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the golem has arms, which appear to be part of its body structure, but the spires of the Brooklyn Bridge are not evident as part of these arms. In Image A, the spires of the Brooklyn Bridge are distinctly visible as part of the bridge structure. Thus, the golem's arms are not reshaped from the bridge's spires.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bridge's cables depicted as sinewy tendons wrapped around the golem’s broad chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chest of the golem appears to be made of stone and does not have the delicate, thin structures that would resemble the cables of the Brooklyn Bridge. In Image A, the cables of the Brooklyn Bridge are clearly visible and do not appear in Image B wrapped around the golem. Therefore, the cables are not depicted in such a manner in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the Freedom Tower been transformed into a tall, crystalline crown positioned on the golem's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golem has a pointed, spiky headpiece that somewhat resembles the shape of the Freedom Tower, but it is not exactly depicted as the tower itself. In Image A, the Freedom Tower is a separate building in the background. Therefore, while the golem’s headpiece might evoke the Freedom Tower's shape, it has not been transformed into it.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the surrounding skyscrapers been transformed into intricate armor plating covering parts of the golem’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the golem is made of stone and has a structured, armored appearance. However, there is no evidence that the skyscrapers themselves have been transformed or are part of the golem's structure. In Image A, the skyscrapers stand as individual entities separate from the bridge. Therefore, the skyscrapers have not been transformed into armor plating.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the golem stand in a majestic, upright, and firmly anchored stance, dominating the cityscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the golem standing upright with a powerful and solid stance. It is positioned prominently, dwarfing the nearby structures, giving it a dominating presence over the cityscape. This characteristic is neither present nor applicable to the original Brooklyn Bridge seen in Image A.",
