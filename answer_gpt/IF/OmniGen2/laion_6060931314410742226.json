        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of flowers and leaves, as well as the grid-like pattern of small rectangles, clearly indicates they are composed of tile-like segments, suggesting a mosaic style.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors used for the petals and leaves are aligned with shades of pearl and jade.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on the floral mosaic and does not include detailed elements of the original building like arches or window frames. The depiction doesn't incorporate any recognizable building features directly as part of the mosaic design, maintaining a focus on floral patterns.",
