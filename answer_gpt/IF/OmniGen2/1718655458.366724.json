      "question": "Are all spheres and cubes replaced with LEGO brick shapes that retain the original marbled patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), both spherical objects and cube-like objects are present. The spheres include marbled patterns, similar to those in the original image. However, not all shapes are transformed into LEGO brick shapes. Some cubes and spheres maintain their original forms and patterns. This suggests that only some elements were transformed into LEGO-style shapes, while others were not.",

      "question": "Do all LEGO bricks have a matte surface texture without reflective highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, some of the blue objects appear to have a glossy finish with visible reflective highlights, indicating they do not have a matte texture. This suggests that not all LEGO brick-like objects in the image have a matte surface.",

      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks arranged in an orderly, structured pattern on a wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, some of the blue brick-like objects are observed to be aligned in a structured, grid-like manner at the base. This indicates that there is an orderly arrangement on the wooden shelf, characteristic of how LEGO bricks could be organized.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue brick-like forms do not clearly show the typical studs or recessed connectors that you would expect from LEGO bricks, based on their visual appearance. These details are essential for interlocking and are absent in the objects depicted.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B, which consists of a wooden shelf, is relatively plain and uncluttered, contributing to a minimalist aesthetic. Compared to Image A, which has a cloudy or frosted appearance, Image B presents a straightforward and clean background, fitting a minimalist style.",
