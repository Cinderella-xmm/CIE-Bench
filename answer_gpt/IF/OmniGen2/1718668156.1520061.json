    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the tall ice tower in the foreground rendered with pixelated textures and visible circuit-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall ice tower is not present in the foreground, rather it's a bright glowing drink with circuit-like patterns visible on its surface. This suggests an emphasis on digital aesthetics rather than simple pixelation, as common in digital or futuristic imagery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the Sydney Opera House represented using glowing neon lines instead of solid surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sydney Opera House retains its solid surfaces and traditional architectural look, not transformed into glowing neon lines. It is depicted more realistically compared to the abstract digital styles seen in other parts of Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waves in the ocean composed of geometric shapes rather than realistic water ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows waves constructed from geometric shapes, resembling digital wireframes or stylized graphics, rather than depicting realistic water ripples that occur naturally in the ocean.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the drink on the left appear as a transparent, floating hologram with visible depth and light distortion effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drink on the left in Image B appears as a glowing container with digital circuit patterns, which gives it a holographic or digital aesthetic appearance, but it is not transparent or floating. Although it is illuminated with glowing lines, the effect of floating or light distortions typical of holograms isn't present in the representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene exhibit a unified futuristic digital aesthetic, with all elements (ice tower, Opera House, ocean, drink) transformed according to their specified styles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a futuristic digital aesthetic through stylized elements: the glowing drink with circuit-like patterns and geometric ocean waves, which contrasts with the iconic but unchanged solid representation of the Sydney Opera House. While most other elements align with a digital theme, the Opera House retains realism, suggesting partial rather than unified transformation.",
