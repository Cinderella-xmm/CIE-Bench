      "question": "Is the edited image a two-panel comic strip with the title “Cake Conundrum!” displayed at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts two scenes side by side, typical of comic strips, showcasing a cake with expressive features in each panel, but there's no visible title 'Cake Conundrum!' at the top of Image B.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the cake have expressive eyes added to its surface, positioned where the face would be, and is there a strawberry placed on top resembling a hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a cake with illustrated expressive eyes approximately where a face would typically be. Additionally, the strawberries on top resemble a decorative hat, adding to the anthropomorphic design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "In the first panel, are the cake creature’s eyes wide open, showing surprise, and is the dialogue “Who ate my delicious corner?!” present in a speech bubble?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the first panel of Image B, the cake's eyes appear wide open, indicating surprise or shock. Furthermore, the speech bubble contains the dialogue 'Who ate my mree delicious corner?!', indicating a slight variation from the question's text but still conveying a similar message.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "In Panel 1, are there faint silhouettes of utensils (such as spoons or forks) visible in the background, suggesting a party setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the first panel in Image B features silhouettes of forks, which could imply a setting related to dining or a party-atmosphere setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "In Panel 2, does the cake creature appear to be shaking its head, has the dialogue “No more free bites, time for dessert defense!” been added, and are strawberries and garnishes arranged as bodyguards and a shield?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the cake shows the same expressive features as in the first panel but does not demonstrate head-shaking. The dialogue bubble actually says 'Cake Conundrum free bitks, time for dessert defense!', which indicates a misspelling. The strawberries atop the cake do not seem to serve the function of bodyguards or shield explicitly.",
