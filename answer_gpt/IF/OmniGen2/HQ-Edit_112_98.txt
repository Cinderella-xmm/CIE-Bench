    "Question": "Q1: Has the sparrow been transformed into an ethereal blossom spirit with a non-realistic, floral appearance?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bird features an exaggerated ethereal design with bright pink feathers and green glowing eyes, which is not typical of real birds, and gives it a surreal, fantasy-like appearance reminiscent of a blossom spirit.
