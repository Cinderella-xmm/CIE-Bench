      "question": "Is the officer wearing a brown leather trench coat instead of the original naval uniform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it is observed that the officer is wearing a brown leather trench coat, which is a shift from the traditional naval uniform seen in Image A. This conclusion is drawn from the distinct leather texture and color of the coat in Image B, which differs from the fabric and color of the naval uniform in Image A.",

      "question": "Are brass gears and mechanical components visibly attached to the officer's clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, brass gears and mechanical components are clearly attached to the officer's clothing, distinguishing it from a typical uniform. This use of mechanical elements is a key visual change that aligns with a steampunk aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the object in the officer's right hand a chronometer-like gadget instead of a bell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembling a chronometer is visible beside the officer, replacing the bell from Image A. The round, detailed design of the chronometer-like gadget contrasts with the simple, metallic form of the bell seen in the original image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features a sky populated with airships and floating city-like structures, indicative of a fantastical, steampunk setting. This is a departure from the serene ocean and sunset background of Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows goggles prominently placed on the tricorne hat, an addition that is not present in Image A. This change enhances the steampunk appearance by incorporating typical accessories associated with the genre.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The officer's posture in Image B remains similar to that in Image A with hands positioned in a similar manner, but without considering the facial expression due to the blurred face, a comparison cannot be completed regarding any changes in facial expression.",

      "question": "Does the overall visual style of the image reflect Victorian-era steampunk aesthetics, including brass elements and mechanical design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's visual style heavily incorporates Victorian-era steampunk aesthetics, characterized by the brown leather coat, brass gears, goggles on the hat, and steam-powered flying machines in the background. This is a marked change from the traditional naval theme of Image A.",
