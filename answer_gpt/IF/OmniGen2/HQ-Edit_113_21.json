      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the first postcard on the left shows a woman standing in front of what appears to be a straw hut, suggested by the thatched appearance resembling traditional straw construction. She seems to be leaning against the doorway of the straw hut.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third postcard from the left displays the woman's jewelry prominently placed on a plain background, with exaggeratedly colorful beads that suggest a more abstract artistic representation rather than a realistic one.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rightmost postcard depicts a small figure that can be interpreted as a woman’s silhouette on a vast and vibrant grassy field, against a clear blue sky. The style appears digitally rendered due to the smooth gradients and artificial saturation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, all three postcards indeed feature vivid, bright colors as part of their design. However, only the second postcard seems to have a border that could be interpreted as geometric. The other postcards do not clearly have geometric borders.",
