    "Question": "Q1: Do the zebra's stripes extend outward and integrate seamlessly with the grass?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes extend beyond its body and appear to seamlessly blend with the black and white striped pattern of the background, which replaces the grass. This gives the appearance of the zebra's stripes merging with its environment, creating a continuous stripe effect from the zebra to the ground. This observation is based on the cohesive design seen in the image, where the zebra and background stripes are uniformly patterned.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the grassland rendered in a black-and-white striped pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the traditional green grass found in Image A has been replaced with a surface covered entirely in a bold black-and-white striped pattern, reminiscent of the zebra's stripes. This pattern is uniform across the ground, indicating that the grassland is indeed rendered in a striped style that matches the zebra.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the image exhibit a surrealistic style, creating an imaginative blend between the zebra and the environment?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a surrealistic style through the imaginative extension of the zebra's stripes into the surrounding environment, which itself is composed of matching black-and-white stripes. This creates a visually unusual and creative scene that is typical of surreal art, where elements are abstracted to blur the lines between different components (the zebra and the ground, in this case) to evoke imagination beyond normal reality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there any abrupt transitions or breaks where the zebra's stripes meet the grass?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no abrupt transitions or breaks where the zebra's stripes meet the ground, as the stripes carry on seamlessly into the environment. The transition is fluid and integrates the zebra's pattern with the overall design of the background. This suggests a continuous flow without any visible interruptions or breaks between the elements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the zebra's original body proportion been maintained despite the extension of its stripes?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the zebra with its body proportions intact, similar to those in Image A. Even though the stripes extend and interact with the surroundings, the zebra itself remains well-proportioned and natural-looking. The extension of stripes does not alter the zebra's body structure, maintaining the realistic aspect of the animal despite the surreal context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
