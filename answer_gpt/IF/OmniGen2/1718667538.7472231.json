    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the tiger figure rendered in a flat, cut-paper style with defined edges and no realistic shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger figure features a flat, stylized look akin to cut-paper art, with strong lines and no gradient or realistic shading patterns, giving an illustration-like appearance. This differs from Image A, where the realistic depiction of fur and shading provides depth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tiger's stripes visibly wider and more stylized than natural tiger markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tiger's stripes in Image B are exaggeratedly wide and sharply defined, resembling stylized patterns rather than natural, thinner tiger stripes. This contrasts with Image A which has more naturalistic and less stylized stripes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tiger's whiskers noticeably longer and thicker than natural proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger's whiskers appear to be designed with a stylized aesthetic, notably thicker and more prominent than what would be seen in a natural tiger. A comparison with Image A shows more realistic proportions of tiger whiskers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the kimono appear as if composed of multiple overlapping paper layers with distinct edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kimono in Image B is rendered in a manner that suggests paper layers, with clear, distinct edges and prints that are aligned sharply, similar to a collage or paper craft technique. This is in contrast to the realistic draping in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there shiny, metallic gold accents on the cherry blossom patterns of the kimono?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kimono patterns in Image B include golden floral elements, but they lack realistic metallic sheen, as would be expected in a paper-rendered image. Image A contains realistic fabric patterns without metallic accents.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible perforations, tabs, or fold lines indicating detachable sections of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any visible perforation marks, tabs, or fold lines that suggest detachable sections, maintaining a flat, continuous illustration style typical of digital or printed graphic art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible fold lines or structural elements suggesting the image can be physically folded or interacted with?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any fold lines or structural elements suggesting physical interaction. It retains a digital or printed graphic style, without indicators of tactile or interactive features.",
