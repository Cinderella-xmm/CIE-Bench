      "question": "Is the figure now a chibi-style bust with an oversized head and simplified body proportions, suitable for tabletop display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues suggest that the figure has characteristics typical of chibi-style art, which includes an oversized head and a simplified body. The proportions are adapted to give a cute, playful appearance, suitable for tabletop display as often seen in collectible figurines.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brown robe features defined, stylized embroidery patterns that stand out and are more exaggerated compared to the subtle details in Image A.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a headdress with vividly colored stripes, enhanced in brightness and definition compared to Image A. This gives a lively and cartoonish appearance, consistent with common artistic depictions where colors are exaggerated for visual impact.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pomegranate is depicted with a glossy surface, showing reflections that suggest a polished texture. The shine is exaggerated compared to the more muted appearance in Image A, likely to enhance the visual appeal typical in stylized or animated objects.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the face is blurred, typically in chibi-style art, faces are characterized by minimalistic lines with simplified features such as small eyes and soft contours. Given the overall chibi-style transformation, it is reasonable to infer that the same simplification applies to the facial features.",

      "explanation": "Image B shows the figure mounted on a smooth, flat wooden base that is visually distinct and portrays a clean aesthetic, suitable for display. This differs from Image A where there is no indication of a base, further emphasizing the transformation into a collectible object.",
