    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image showing a single, continuous serpent-shaped creature composed of the beads instead of loose or clustered beads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads are arranged to form a continuous, elongated shape resembling a serpent. It is depicted as a cohesive entity rather than loose or clustered beads. This conclusion is drawn from the visual information where the shape and arrangement suggest a snake-like form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red and yellow patterns used to create a scaly texture along the body of the serpent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts a serpent with red and yellow patterns repeatedly arranged along its body. These patterns mimic a scaly texture, commonly seen in reptiles like snakes. By observing the visual cues - the recurring geometric designs - one can associate these with scales.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the serpent have two blue circular features positioned as eyes at its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent-like figure in Image B is observed to have blue circular elements placed at what appears to be the head region, resembling eyes. Through the positioning and context, these blue circles can logically be identified as the serpent's eyes.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the black motifs arranged as detailed, tribal-style patterns along the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's body features intricate black designs mixed with geometric shapes, which can be interpreted as tribal-style patterns. This conclusion is reached by examining the distinctive motifs that commonly represent tribal aesthetics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail of the serpent in Image B is depicted extending outwards, tapering into a thin form with smaller bead-like elements attached. These features resemble a flowing tail with beads as end tips, supported by the visual depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors present are red, yellow, blue, and black, consistent with the palette seen in Image A. The visual examination shows no introduction of other colors, which indicates the artist adhered strictly to the original color scheme.",
