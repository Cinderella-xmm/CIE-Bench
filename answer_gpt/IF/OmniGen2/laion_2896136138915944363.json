      "question": "Is the sandpiper illustration now part of a box-shaped packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandpiper illustration is clearly incorporated into a box-shaped packaging design. The packaging has distinct box outlines and features the illustration prominently on its front side, which is typically how products in boxes are marketed. Understanding that the practice of placing illustrations on packaging is common in retail, the recognition of a box shape signifies purposeful design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sandpiper illustrated in a stylized manner and placed on the front of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sandpiper illustration prominently displayed on the front of the packaging. The illustration is stylized, resembling a drawn or painted depiction rather than a photograph, which is typical for box packaging to convey more artistic or brand identity characteristics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are nature-inspired textures visible on the surface of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the packaging design does not display any textures that directly resemble or evoke natural elements like wood grain, leaf patterns, or other organic motifs. The surface appears smooth and uniformly colored with no evident nature-inspired textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the text \"Shoreline Explorer Set\" appear on the packaging in an eco-themed font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the text 'Shoresline Wathline Expler Set', which sounds similar to 'Shoreline Explorer Set'. However, the font used does not inherently convey an eco-theme. Eco-themed fonts often have a rustic or natural aesthetic that includes elements like leaf motifs or earthy color schemes, which are absent here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bottom of the packaging feature a flat surface with wave-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, the bottom part of the packaging is depicted in a solid color without any visible wave-like patterns. Typical wave patterns would include flowing lines or curves indicative of water, which are not present on the packaging's flat surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a cut-out window on the packaging shaped like binoculars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a cut-out shaped like binoculars on the packaging itself. While there is a binocular-like object associated with the packaging, this appears to be a separate item rather than a cut-out window on the box.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the binocular-shaped cut-out reveal internal components of the birdwatching kit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a separate object shaped like binoculars positioned next to the packaging. However, this binocular shape is not a cut-out on the packaging itself, nor does it reveal internal components or contents inside the packaging. It instead seems to be an additional item perhaps included in a set.",
