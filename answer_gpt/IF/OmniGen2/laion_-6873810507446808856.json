      "question": "Are there two distinct anthropomorphic pancake characters with large, expressive eyes drawn on them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear depiction of two anthropomorphic pancake characters, each with large, expressive eyes. The exaggerated features are typical of a cartoon illustration, where inanimate objects are given human-like characteristics. This analysis is based on the observation of visual cues such as the large eyes and facial expressions associated with the pancakes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the butter pat positioned on top of the upper pancake in a way that visually functions as a hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butter does not appear in the same fashion as described. Instead, the character's hat is a separate item placed on one of the anthropomorphic pancake stacks, giving the pancake a whimsical look. This can be deduced from the presence of the hat in the third panel which distinctly contrasts with the form and function of butter.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the syrup flow from the pancakes in a wide, dramatic arc resembling a superhero’s cape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does show a pancake stack with a superhero cape in the second panel; however, the syrup is not depicted as flowing in a dramatic arc resembling a cape. The cape and syrup are distinct elements in the cartoon style illustration. The syrup is seen on the pancakes, but the cape is a separate object worn by the pancake character.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are coffee cups and scrambled eggs visible in the background or nearby in Panel 1?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the first panel does clearly depict coffee cups and a bowl with what could be assumed as scrambled eggs given its context and typical breakfast scenario. This conclusion is drawn from the visual representation of breakfast items with typical shapes and colors associated with coffee and eggs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a speech bubble in Panel 1 containing the text “What mischief are we spreading today?” written in a bold, playful handwritten font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a speech bubble in the first panel, but the text inside reads “What misteaous are you spreting Breasthing today?” instead of the text mentioned in the question. The playful handwritten font is evident, consistent with a cartoon style, yet the text itself differs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a depiction of the pancakes sliding down a large, flowing syrup river originating from a giant syrup jug?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of pancakes sliding down a syrup river. Each panel shows the pancake characters in static positions or implied movement unrelated to sliding down syrup. This observation, combined with world knowledge of pan-cake and syrup dynamics in cartoons, supports the conclusion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a text box in Panel 2 containing the text “Adventure is calling—sticky and sweet!” written in a bold, playful handwritten font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the second panel contains a speech bubble with text reading “Adventures to RKLPY?” rather than “Adventure is calling—sticky and sweet!”. While the font style is accurate, the text itself does not match what is described in the question.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the image use bright, saturated colors and exaggerated proportions typical of a cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses bright and saturated colors with exaggerated proportions, such as large eyes and humorous facial expressions typical of cartoon illustrations. This style lends itself to engaging visual storytelling for younger audiences and aligns with common cartoon design elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Is there sufficient white space around the speech bubbles and text boxes to enhance readability and visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates the use of white space around speech bubbles and text boxes to ensure text is readable. This design choice helps maintain clear visual flow, typical of cartoon layouts, to ensure dialogue elements are distinct and easily interpreted. The placement and balance of the elements confirm this layout design.",
