        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of traditional cactus spines, the cactus features protrusions that resemble crystal shards. They have a sparkle and sheen typically associated with crystals, different from the thin, sharp appearance of spines seen on a regular cactus. This change indicates that the spines might have been replaced with crystal shards in the edited image.",
