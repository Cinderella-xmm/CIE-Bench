      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the shoe upper been replaced with a transparent material that reveals intricate circuitry patterns inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the shoe upper as seemingly translucent, as it has a different texture that appears semi-transparent with visible patterns beneath it, resembling circuitry. This visual cue combined with common knowledge about technological design suggests the shoe upper has been replaced with a transparent material that displays circuitry-like designs.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the Swoosh logo emit a cool neon blue glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the Swoosh logo has a distinct dark appearance and does not exhibit any glowing or neon blue effects. This suggests that despite the futuristic look of the shoe, the logo itself is non-luminous, leading to the conclusion that it does not emit a glow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a small digital screen attached to the strap that displays dynamic animations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a small blue screen or panel attached to the strap of the shoe, suggesting it functions like a digital display. Given its location and design, it could reasonably be assumed to display dynamic visual content, which aligns with common expectations of digital or futuristic sneaker designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a collapsible digital shoe box with a metallic finish and holographic branding visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no visible shoe box, digital or otherwise. The focus is solely on the shoe itself, and there is no indication of any packaging element such as a collapsible box within the frame.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are modern geometric patterns visible on the surface of the digital shoe box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since no shoe box is visible in Image B, there are consequently no patterns, geometric or otherwise, on any digital shoe box surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the sneaker retain its original structural proportions and silhouette despite the futuristic modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, when compared with Image A, shows that despite the modifications that give the shoe a futuristic appearance, the overall shape, style, and outline of the sneaker remain consistent with its original design. This indicates that while the aesthetic elements have been altered, the sneaker's structural proportions and silhouette are retained.",
