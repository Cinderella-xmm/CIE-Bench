        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a spoon positioned on a blue napkin, which occupies a similar position as the fork in Image A. The presence of a spoon instead of a fork, combined with the knowledge that both serve similar dining purposes but are different in shape and use, indicates a replacement has occurred.",
