      "question": "Is the background of the image now a flat white studio background instead of a sandy beach?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment is clearly more neutral and controlled compared to the first image. There is a plain white background, consistent with a studio setting.
