    "Question": "Q1: Is the black vase replaced with a teapot?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, a white teapot is prominently visible on the table between the two armchairs. This differs from Image A, the original image, where a black vase was present at the same location. The teapot's presence clearly indicates a change, replacing the black vase. Common visual recognition of shapes such as a vase and a teapot helps in identifying this change.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there two porcelain cups placed on the table?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, only a single teapot is visible on the table, without any porcelain cups accompanying it. Visual inspection identifies these items and supports the conclusion that there are no cups. The size and shape of different objects ensure clear differentiation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the arrangement of the teapot and cups imply a conversation scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a teapot alone, without cups, does not suggest a conversation scene typically aided by having cups for a shared drink or tea session. Social interactions usually involve sharing drinks, which are absent here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Have the original background and furniture positions remained unchanged?",
    "explanation": "A visual comparison of Image A (original image) and Image B (edited image) reveals that the positions of the armchairs, table, and other background elements such as the curtains and plant are consistent across both images. This stability in arrangement further supports unchanged furniture and background positions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Do the teapot and porcelain cups match the lighting and environmental conditions in the room?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting conditions in the room appear soft and natural, conducive to harmonious integration of elements. Although no cups are present, the white teapot fits well within the sceneâ€™s environmental color palette and lighting conditions, ensuring visual coherence within the arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
