    "Question": "Q1: Are the structural lines of the cabin composed entirely of geometric shapes with no organic curves?",
    "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) showcases a cabin with structural lines that are straight and uniformly defined, employing geometric shapes such as rectangles and straight lines without any organic curves. The design emphasizes angularity and symmetry, which are hallmarks of geometric design. This conclusion is drawn from the consistent use of straight, rigid lines rather than curves.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the moon depicted as a glowing, radiant circle with visible light rays or halo effects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is illustrated as a bright, glowing circle without rays or halo effects typically associated with radiant light. It appears flat and stylized, aligning with the graphic quality of the entire image, which prefers simplified, bold shapes over detailed, realistic light effects.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the plants rendered in symmetrical, patterned arrangements instead of natural growth forms?",
    "explanation": "The depiction of the plants in Image B follows a symmetrical and patterned arrangement, which is evident from the stylized representation of leaves and vegetation that adhere to a uniform pattern, characteristic of design elements rather than the irregularity found in natural growth.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are metallic textures and colors (gold and silver) visibly applied to key elements such as the cabin frame, windows, or decorative motifs?",
    "explanation": "Image B features colors typical of metallic textures like gold on the cabin's structural lines and elements. The choice of colors and the flat rendering give a sense of metallic sheen, especially on the cabinâ€™s frame and the surrounding decorative motifs, capturing the luxurious feel often associated with Art Deco design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there abstract, geometrically shaped clouds present in the sky?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are depicted as stylized, abstract shapes, consistent with geometric forms. Their rendering avoids organic wisps and instead emphasizes form through angular designs, mirroring the structured aesthetic prevalent throughout the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the windows display bold, dynamic features such as thick frames, angular divisions, or radiating patterns?",
    "explanation": "The windows in Image B exhibit bold features with distinct thick frames and angular divisions. The design is visually prominent and mirrors the dynamic lines and patterns typically found in Art Deco and geometric art forms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the entire image exhibit a flat, graphic quality with strong symmetry, angular lines, and decorative elements characteristic of Art Deco posters?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a flat, graphic quality with strong symmetry, angular lines, and decorative elements, all characteristic of Art Deco design. The stylization prioritizes symmetry, uniformity, and ornamental geometry, creating a poster-like aesthetic. This design approach focuses on decoration through bold lines and patterns rather than realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
