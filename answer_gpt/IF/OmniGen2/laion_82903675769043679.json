      "question": "Has the English manor-style house been replaced with a structure composed of fragmented, colorful geometric planes consistent with cubist art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building's facade displays vibrant, colorful geometric shapes that overlap, creating a fragmented, cubist-style appearance. These planes differ from traditional architecture and suggest a transformation to a cubist art style. This differs from typical manor-style architecture, characterized by consistent structural elements and subdued tones.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building's surface consists of vivid geometric shapes that replace the brick masonry, providing a non-traditional and artistic look. These geometric planes are irregular in shape and color, standing in contrast to the orderly and uniform appearance typical of brick walls.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the crowd in Image B, the individuals retain their detailed and recognizable human features, displaying clothing, posture, and interaction typical of real people. They are not transformed into abstract or faceless forms.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grass area in Image B appears smooth and consistent, lacking any checkered patterns or overlays. This is typical for well-maintained golf courses, which prioritize even, lush green surfaces.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection in the water remains relatively clear and intact, mirroring the house and surrounding landscape as in a realistic water surface. There is no presence of prismatic or angular distortion that alters the reflection significantly.",
