      "question": "Are the ties depicted as 3D chibi-style objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties have a smooth and rounded appearance, typical of 3D renderings, which gives them a chibi-style look. The surface of the ties is more reflective and the design looks cartoonish, stepping away from a realistic texture and moving towards a stylized representation. This observation is based on the visual presentation of the ties, which mimics the exaggeration and simplification characteristics found in chibi art.",

      "question": "Are the striped and polka dot patterns still vibrant and clearly visible on the 3D chibi-style ties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the ties remain clear and easy to distinguish. The stripes and dots are bold, with distinct colors that stand out against the background. The vibrant nature of these patterns is evident as the contrast between colors is maintained, making them vividly visible even in the 3D chibi adaptation.",

      "question": "Are the ties placed inside a realistic drawer setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the ties against a wooden surface with visible drawer handles, implying they are part of a drawer setting. The knobs and the wood texture suggest that this is intended to represent a drawer. However, since the ties and the setting are rendered in a 3D style, the realism is arguable, but the visual clues directly imply a drawer setting.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ties arranged in a way that suggests they are part of an ornamental display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties are neatly placed next to each other, with their patterns prominently visible. This kind of arrangement tends to suggest a deliberate display to highlight the ties, similar to how decorative items are showcased. The positioning on a visible part of what seems to be a drawer further supports their ornamental presentation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the original vibrant colors and patterns of the ties been maintained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comparing Image A and Image B, the colors and patterns of the ties appear consistent in their vibrancy and clarity. The striped tie still boasts its multicolored bands, and the polka dot tie retains its bright blue background with white dots. This indicates that the original color scheme and patterns are preserved in the edited, 3D chibi-style version.",
