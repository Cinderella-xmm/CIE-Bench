      "question": "Does the image include a depiction of the dog from its left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is depicted facing left, which allows us to see its left side. The dog's head is towards the left, showing the left side of its body including the ears, eyes, and tail. We know this is the left side because the dog is facing left, which is consistent with the orientation of the bed as well. Therefore, the direction of the bed's headboard corroborates the assumption that we are seeing the dog's left side.",

      "question": "Is the dog illustrated from its back view within the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of the dog sitting with its back towards the viewer. The dog's body is facing away and the tail is visible behind, typical of a back view. The dogâ€™s head is turned slightly giving a clear view of the back. We can see the rear of the dog clearly including the symmetry of the tail and the collar from behind.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both the left side and back views of the dog combined into a single image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two depictions of the dog within a single frame: one of the dog facing forward towards the left side and one of the dog facing backward towards the viewer. In the same image area you can see the dog from two different angles simultaneously. Therefore, this confirms that both the left side and back views are amalgamated into one image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both depictions of the dog are situated on the same bed. The bed extends continuously across the image, with the dog occupying space on it when viewed from both the left side and back side angles. The general features like the wooden frame and green bedsheet are shared across both views, ensuring both parts of the dog's image are seen on the bed.",

      "question": "Do the bed and bedsheet appear consistently in both views of the dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bed structure with its wooden frame and the green bedsheet is consistently portrayed in both the left and back views of the dog. The continuity of the bed's design and coloration is maintained from one configuration to the other. The bed's fixtures such as the frame and bedsheet remain unchanged across both angles displayed.",
