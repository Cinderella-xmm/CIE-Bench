    "Question": "Q2: Does the right-side skier cast a shadow that suggests depth and closeness to the viewer?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right-side skier casts a shadow on the snow, which is sharply defined and elongated in the direction opposite the sun. The shadow's position and length suggest that the skier is in contact with the snow surface, adding a sense of depth and closeness to the viewer.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there motion lines or blurring effects around the edges of the right-side skier to simulate movement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible motion lines or blurring effects around the skier to indicate high speed or simulate movement. The image is crisp and focuses on capturing the skier's controlled descent rather than suggesting motion through blur.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the right-side skier been repositioned to appear significantly closer to the viewer than any other objects in the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right-side skier is positioned prominently in the foreground compared to other elements like the left-side skier or the mountain backdrop. This positioning creates the illusion of the right-side skier being closer to the viewer, highlighted further by the skier's larger size relative to other scene objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the right-side skier positioned at an angle that simulates leaning forward or moving closer toward the viewer?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right-side skier is angled slightly towards the viewer, with the body posture and ski positions suggesting a forward-leaning stance. This angle simulates an active skiing pose where the skier is engaged in motion down the slope, giving the impression of leaning forward into the motion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
