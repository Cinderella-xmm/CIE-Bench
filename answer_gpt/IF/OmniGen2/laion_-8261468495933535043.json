      "question": "Are the sausages, salad, and egg completely replaced by glass tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire dish is constructed using mosaic tiles, including the sausage, salad, and egg. The visual cues indicate distinct tile textures with glossy finishes and defined edges, suggesting a transformation from food items to a mosaic art piece. By merging this visual information with general knowledge of mosaics, which typically consist of small glass or ceramic pieces, the conclusion is reached that the food items are indeed entirely replaced by glass tiles.",

      "question": "Are the tiles used for the sausage shapes in warm terracotta tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual examination of the sausage reveals a warm, earthy tone akin to terracotta. This observation aligns with world knowledge regarding color palettes common in ceramic tiles and complements the aesthetic intentions of mosaic art. Thus, the tiles used for the sausage shapes exhibit warm terracotta tones.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tiles forming the salad in leafy green colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The salad in Image B is composed of tiles that are visually consistent with leafy greens, such as varying shades of green resembling natural leaves. This visual observation, integrated with common knowledge concerning green hues used to replicate foliage in art, leads to the conclusion that the salad elements are depicted using leafy green-colored tiles.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the egg-shaped area composed of round tiles in sunny yellow tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the egg area consists of circular tiles in a vibrant yellow, similar to a sunny or yolk-like color. This visual cue correlates with an understanding of mosaic art techniques, where specific color choices evoke familiar imagery. Thus, the egg-shaped region is indeed fashioned from round tiles in sunny yellow tones.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the tiles used for the sausages visibly larger than those used for the lettuce?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an examination reveals larger tiles used for representing the sausage shapes compared to the finer, more detailed tiles representing the lettuce. This visual distinction corresponds with the practice of using larger tiles for more uniform shapes and sizes in art composition, confirming the sausages' tiles are noticeably larger than those used for the lettuce.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the mosaic composition arranged symmetrically on a plain ceramic background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a mosaic arrangement that, upon inspection, does not appear symmetric. The visual layout exhibits asymmetry in tile sizes and positioning of elements, typical of artistic mosaics which often embrace dynamism rather than strict symmetry. Considering the background, it appears plain and ceramic, serving as a neutral canvas for the mosaic design. Thus, while the background is plain ceramic, the mosaic composition itself is not arranged symmetrically.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image B illustration is indeed vibrant, with various colors creating an engaging aesthetic. Moreover, the cohesive arrangement of tiles to represent recognizable food items reflects an artistically considered mosaic design. These visual cues, supported by world knowledge about the intent behind mosaic artwork—to be visually appealing and harmonious—confirm the presence of a vibrant and cohesive design using glass tiles.",
