        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The industrial structures on the left of Image B are depicted with heavy, expressive brushstrokes characteristic of impasto paintings. This style involves the application of thick paint, creating visible texture on the canvas. The layers of paint are apparent as they define the edges and surfaces of the structures in a bold and exaggerated manner, which is often used to convey a sense of depth and texture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a very vivid and emotionally charged color palette, which includes bright blue, yellow, and orange hues that contrast sharply with each other. Such a palette is effective in conveying an emotional and dramatic effect, enhancing the visual impact of the scene. This use of contrasting colors is typical in expressive art styles that aim to evoke strong emotional responses.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The winding brown road in Image B is depicted using dynamic and thick brushstrokes characteristic of the impasto technique. This involves using layers of paint to create a textured appearance, giving the road a sense of movement and three-dimensionality. The use of these brushstrokes adds a sense of energy and flow to the composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frosted trees and distant peaks in Image B are illustrated using swirling and dynamic brushstrokes. These are highly stylized and reminiscent of van Gogh's technique, where the brushstrokes themselves convey movement and energy. This style emphasizes the emotional content of the image, creating an impression of vitality and action.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is rendered in a very turbulent and swirling manner, with visible patterns that depict stars. The swirling patterns and bright yellow stars against a dark blue night sky are highly suggestive of the expressive style seen in van Gogh's 'The Starry Night.' This portrayal creates a dynamic and dramatic effect, contributing to the emotional intensity of the scene.",
