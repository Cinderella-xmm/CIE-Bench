    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there swirling cloud-like structures integrated into the tower's form or surrounding it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe prominent swirling cloud-like structures surrounding the tower. These clouds appear to seamlessly integrate with the environment and add a fantastical touch to the scene which is consistent with the edited style of the image, suggesting imagination or mystical element, unlike natural clouds in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there glowing runes visible along the wooden surfaces of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows glowing runes on the surfaces of the tower. These runes are identifiable due to their luminescence and the ethereal style they bring to the structure, fitting a supernatural or magical theme. In Image A, the surfaces are plain or carved with non-luminous patterns typical of medieval architectural woodwork.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the roof been replaced with shimmering crystal spires instead of wooden or thatched material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof of the tower is transformed into shimmering crystal-like spires. The appearance of these spires is markedly different from traditional wooden or thatched materials seen in Image A, enhancing the surreal and enchanted atmosphere of the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there glowing orbs located at the top of each spire on the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features glowing orbs positioned at the apex of the tower's spires. These orbs emit light and contribute to the tower's magical and mystical appearance, while Image A lacks any additional luminous adornments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have all trees in the scene been transformed into silver spiral shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding environment is composed of cloud-like forms, and trees from Image A have been removed. The fantastical clouds envelop the structure indicating a thematic shift rather than a literal transformation into silver spiral shapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there translucent, ghost-like birds circling the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains birds that appear to be drawn in a translucent, ethereal manner, which can be interpreted as ghost-like due to their light color and stylized rendering. This fits the magical theme of the edited version. In Image A, birds are realistically drawn and solid, indicating typical style representation of the natural world.",
