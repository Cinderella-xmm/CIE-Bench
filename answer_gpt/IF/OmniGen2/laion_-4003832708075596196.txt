    "Question": "Q1: Has the tree trunk been reshaped into distinct arm and leg forms?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tree trunk appears unchanged in terms of form, still representing a stylized trunk with branches. There is no clear indication of distinct arm and leg forms. Therefore, based on visual observation combined with world knowledge of tree structures, the trunk does not resemble arms or legs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there leaf-shaped elements positioned as heads with cartoonish facial features?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the leaves are not transformed into heads with cartoonish facial features. They remain as leaf illustrations without any anthropomorphic transformation such as eyes or facial outlines that would typically denote a face.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the leaf faces display visible cartoonish facial expressions (e.g., eyes, mouth, eyebrows)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, none of the leaf shapes are depicted with cartoonish facial expressions like eyes, mouth, or eyebrows. They retain the appearance of fallen autumn leaves without added features.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there text bubbles with Thanksgiving greetings placed around the characters?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains text bubbles with presumably playful words like 'Thankwioe' and 'Ghanspwiwe,' which might be intended to mimic greetings or expressive dialogue, albeit not traditional Thanksgiving greetings. Therefore, technically yes, text bubbles exist.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the entire illustration, including characters and text bubbles, contained within the original border?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows that while most elements lie within the border, the text bubbles slightly extend outside the square frame of the tree but are still within the card design itself. The main part of the illustration is contained within the compositional border.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are all colors used in the illustration consistent with the autumn palette (orange, yellow, red, brown)?",

}

{

    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Happy Thanksgiving' has been replaced with 'Thankuyyroming.' Thus, the original phrase 'Happy Thanksgiving' no longer appears below the illustration.",
