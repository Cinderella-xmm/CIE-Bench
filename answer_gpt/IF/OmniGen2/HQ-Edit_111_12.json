      "question": "Are the knitting needles visibly larger than their original size in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knitting needles are depicted crossing in front of the writing panel, appearing slightly exaggerated in size compared to typical knitting needles. In Image A, the knitting needles held by the woman appear to be of regular size and proportion, fitting comfortably in her hands. The exaggeration in size and dramatic depiction in Image B suggests they are larger than their original representation.",

      "question": "Does the cup on the side table have visible swirling lines above it representing steam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cup situated towards the right side of the writing panel is shown with visible swirling lines above, indicating steam emanating from it. This typical style of animation suggests a hot beverage, which aligns with common illustrations of steam. In Image A, the cup on the table does not show any visible steam or swirling lines above it.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the fabric draped over the woman's lap been transformed to show a visible yarn or knitted pattern texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric held by the woman in the writing panel shows a clear knitted pattern texture that is vividly defined. In Image A, while the fabric does appear to be knitted, the texture is less pronounced, with a more realistic depiction. The exaggerated and defined textures in Image B showcase a transformation to highlight the knitting more visibly.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a rectangular writing panel present in the image that has a border made to look like knitted yarn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a distinct rectangular writing panel with decorative elements. This panel is positioned centrally within the image, with border detailing resembling knitted yarn patterns. Image A lacks any such writing panel, focusing instead on a realistic scene. The addition in Image B is apparent and carries cartoon-like detail consistent with the knitting theme.",

      "question": "Is the writing panel located inside the pages of an open book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the writing panel is visibly set on top of the pages of an open book, suggesting that the image is designed to mimic or imitate illustrations from a book. It distinctly rests within the open pages, leveraging the book as a platform for the drawing. This arrangement is absent in Image A, where the setting does not feature an open book with a writing panel.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a soft, glowing lamplight visible in the image, contributing to a warm ambient glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a lamplight to the right of the writing panel casting a soft, warm glow, enhancing the ambiance of the scene. The lighting effect contributes to the overall warm and cozy atmosphere. Similarly, Image A includes a lamplight, but the warm lighting aids the realistic portrayal of a calm, comfortable environment. In both images, the light fixture serves the same purpose.",

      "question": "Has the overall image style been changed to a cartoon style with exaggerated features and simplified textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cartoon style, where the features are exaggerated and textures simplifiedâ€”a typical style for animated or illustrative art. The visible changes in character proportions, such as the enlarged knitting needles and stylized steam, contribute to this animated aesthetic. Image A, by contrast, leans towards a more realistic and detailed depiction, stressing authentic textures and proportions without exaggerated features.",
