    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a holographic projection screen added to the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cue of an object with vivid blue colors and a luminescent quality is strongly associated with a holographic projection. Such visual properties, commonly seen in futuristic or sci-fi contexts, suggest that a holographic projection screen has been added.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the holographic projection appear to emerge from the man's phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the added holographic screen is not emerging from a phone but rather hovering above the wrapped sandwich. There is no indication of a phone in the area where the screen is visualized.",

      "question": "Does the holographic projection screen display a city map interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic projection screen in Image B features outlines that resemble skyscrapers and cityscape features, which align with a city map or city representation. The luminescent blue graphics and linear designs are indicative of a city map interface.",

      "question": "Is the holographic projection screen designed in a futuristic and transparent style characteristic of sci-fi elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic screen in Image B has a futuristic design, utilizing a transparent look with glowing outlines, which is characteristic of sci-fi elements. This type of design typically implies advanced technology and is commonly seen in science fiction media.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparing Image A and Image B, the only notable alteration is the addition of the holographic projection screen. Other elements, such as the sandwich, knife, and paper, appear unchanged and consistent with respect to the original image.",
