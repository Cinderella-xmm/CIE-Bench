      "question": "Is the sandwich depicted in a thick-painted cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich is illustrated with clear outlines and simple colors, lacking intricate details. This visual style matches the characteristics of a thick-painted cartoon style, which often features bold outlines, flat colors, and a playful, simplified aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the layers of the sandwich cross-section clearly emphasized with distinct textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich layers like the bread, lettuce, and meat patty are illustrated using flat, uniform colors with minimal shading, lacking detailed textures. This doesn't emphasize distinct textures as would be seen in a more realistic or textured illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the lettuce been simplified into smeared green shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lettuce is represented as a single, curved green shape that looks more like a broad, stylized leafy form rather than individual leaves, which aligns with a simplified depiction, characteristic of smeared or generalized shapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Are there sauce decorations added around the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an orange, abstract, curved shape around the edge of the plate, resembling a decorative sauce swirl, which is not part of the sandwich itself but rather an addition for visual flair.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the final image style fit a modern Western restaurant menu visual aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon-like style in Image B, with its simplified layers and bright colors, might not align with a more traditional or realistic representation used in modern Western restaurant menus, which typically employ realistic photographs to illustrate dishes.",
