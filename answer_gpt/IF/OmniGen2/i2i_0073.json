      "question": "Has the reflection in the mirror been replaced with a nighttime city skyline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of a nighttime city skyline visible in the mirror, with various buildings and a dark sky. This is distinctly different from a typical mirror reflection showing the room itself. Applying common sense, this visual cue illustrates that the reflection has been altered to show a different scene entirely.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the new reflection in the mirror enhance visual depth compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the city skyline provides a sense of depth since it presents an expansive view extending into the distance with the entire cityscape visible, which inherently gives a sense of depth. In contrast, Image A features a flat reflection of the room, which doesn't provide as much perceived dimensionality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mirror's position and frame identical to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the mirror's frame and position appear to not have changed from what is seen in Image A. Both images show a vertical mirror with a similar frame positioned above the sink. The similar structural details indicate no alteration in its position or design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the new reflection include elements indicative of a nighttime setting, such as a dark sky and lit buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays a city skyline where the dark blue sky suggests nighttime, complemented by lit buildings demonstrating lights typically associated with evening illumination. This setup signals a nighttime environment distinctly from Image A, where reflection shows an indoor room.",

    {

      "question": "Have the sink, countertop, and accessories remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the features in Image B to Image A, the elements such as the sink design, countertop, and accessories like the soap dispenser, faucet, and decorative vase remain consistent. There is no visible difference in these components indicating they have not been altered.",
