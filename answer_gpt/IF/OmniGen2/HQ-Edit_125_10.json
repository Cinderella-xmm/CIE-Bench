      "question": "Is the Viking ship displayed as artwork on the front cover of a rectangular board game box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front cover of the rectangular box prominently features an illustration of a Viking ship as part of the artwork. This is a common design choice to highlight the theme of the product, especially in board games pertaining to historical or nautical themes. The ship with its sail and distinct Viking style elements is the central visual focus of the box cover.",

      "question": "Are Norse motifs such as runic patterns, interlacing designs, or dragon heads visibly integrated into the artwork of the ship on the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship displayed on the front cover of the box does not visibly feature Norse motifs such as runic patterns, interlacing designs, or dragon heads. The artwork is more simplified and stylized to appeal as a board game cover, which sometimes focuses more on clarity and appeal rather than intricate historical accuracy.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the title \"Voyage of the Vikings\" displayed in bold, readable typography on the box cover?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title on the box cover in Image B reads 'VIKANES' with 'THE' underneath in bold typography. While this is related to the Viking theme, the exact phrase 'Voyage of the Vikings' does not appear. Therefore, the title is bold and readable but does not match exactly to 'Voyage of the Vikings.'",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the circular knotwork pattern from the sail used as part of a game board layout, such as a grid or path system, within the box artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box cover does not depict any use of the circular knotwork pattern from the sail as part of a game board layout like a grid or path system. The cover focuses on presenting the Viking ship and title rather than additional internal game graphics.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, stylized figures resembling the rowers placed along the ship's side or on the game board area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the bottom part of the box cover, there are small, stylized figures dressed in Viking-style attire standing next to the ship artwork but not physically along the ship's sides or on a distinct game board area. They are likely intended to represent characters in the game, resembling crew or warriors, but not as part of a board layout.",

      "question": "Do the side panels of the game box feature a visible wooden texture or grain pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side panels of the box are not visibly displaying a wooden texture or grain pattern. The focus of the box seems to be more on the title and Viking-themed artwork with solid colors, without extra detail such as wood grain normally meant to suggest authenticity or thematic connection.",
