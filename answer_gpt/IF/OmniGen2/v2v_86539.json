      "question": "Do the characters in the edited image have bold ink outlines and vibrant flat colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are depicted with distinct, bold outlines that are characteristic of comic or cartoon illustrations. The use of vibrant flat colors, such as bright yellows, blues, and pinks, is evident, accentuating their cartoonish appearance and making each character and element stand out significantly. This style contrasts with softer or more shaded artistic approaches.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each character is placed within separate quadrants of the image, suggesting specific activities. The layout uses a comic strip format where each panel or quadrant visually separates the characters and provides context clues for their actions; for instance, one character is in a box indicating resting or sleeping in a confined space, while another is at a table suggesting dining.",

      "question": "Is there a miniature gym corner present for the exercising figure with a green headband?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character with a green headband is drawn with an expressive, joyous stance rather than explicitly surrounded by any gym-like or exercise equipment. The background is minimalistic, which does not depict any gym corner or related objects such as weights or exercise mats. World knowledge suggests that gyms are equipped with recognizable exercise equipment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is illustrated sitting peacefully in a cardboard box set against a cartoon sky backdrop, providing a comfortable and resting visual impression. The box serves as a kind of restful nook. However, the environment is simple and stylized without additional details signifying coziness such as blankets or cushions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a character sitting at a table with a casual and content demeanor while seemingly engaging in an activity like eating. The figureâ€™s presence at a table indicates a dining setting, yet, the background and context are simplified to accentuate the character interaction rather than an elaborately defined dining space.",
