      "question": "Is there a visible logo placed on the handle of the hammer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer handle does not feature any visible logos or branding elements. The handle appears to be made of wood, and the surface is clean without any discernible markings. The analysis is based on a close observation of the hammer's handle, noting that logos typically stand out visually, and would be evident if present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there elegant, readable typographic elements displayed directly on the wood shavings scattered across the workbench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When examining Image B, the wood shavings on the workbench do not contain any typographic elements. The shavings are shaped randomly and naturally without any imposed text or design. Visually, typography on scattered shavings would be notably clear and distinctive, which is not observed here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a horizontal rustic textured banner positioned at the top of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a horizontal element located at the top of the image, resembling a banner. However, instead of being textured and rustic, it appears to be a smooth, designed piece with typography 'HIGH HIGHLENTED.' Its visible material contrasts with the wooden aesthetic typically associated with rustic themes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pegboard in grayscale with visible copper-colored accents on tools or hardware?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pegboard is predominantly black, which can be part of a grayscale scheme. Notably, there are copper-colored accents on the pegboard, such as logos and badges beneath the tools. This combination fits the description of a grayscale backdrop with copper elements. These accents contrast the pegboard, facilitating easier recognition.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a sleek, minimalist business card visible behind the tools on the pegboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, there does seem to be a small element resembling a business card between some of the tools, positioned centrally left. However, this object is designed with some graphics or text, similar to identification or branding, which is not a hallmark of minimalist business cards. Therefore, it does not strictly conform to the concept of a sleek, minimalist business card.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all original tools visible and retained in their original positions on the pegboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, there are visible changes in the arrangement and number of tools on the pegboard. While some tools maintain their positions, new elements such as logos and designs introduced in the edited image suggest shifts in positions or removal/addition of tools. This implies alterations have been made compared with the original setup.",
