    "Question": "Q1: Has the diffuse, smoky brown background been replaced with an expansive blackboard?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background has changed to a blackboard with several mathematical equations and circular drawings. This is distinctively different from Image A, which has a diffuse, smoky brown background. The recognition is based on the visible features of a blackboard, including the typical dark color and presence of chalk writings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the blackboard intricately covered with chalk-written equations of relativity and swirling galactic sketches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blackboard is adorned with what appears to be mathematical equations and circular sketches, which may suggest physics-related content. The presence of these elements aligns with typical representations of a subject like relativity often associated with Albert Einstein.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the soft, warm illumination on both Albert Einstein and the pineapple remain consistent after the background change?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on Albert Einstein and the pineapple appears consistent with Image A, characterized by a soft, warm light. The brightness and shadows on the objects suggest that the lighting conditions have not significantly changed between the images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the blackboard exhibit an aged appearance?",
    "explanation": "The blackboard in Image B does not show visible signs of aging. It appears clean and well-maintained, primarily featuring chalk markings without any indications of wear or damage that typically characterize an aged blackboard.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the positions and appearances of Albert Einstein and the pineapple remained unchanged?",
    "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the positions and appearances of Albert Einstein and the pineapple are consistent. Their placement and visual attributes are maintained, with only the background being modified between the images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
