      "question": "Is the leaf enclosed within a transparent spherical container resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf appears to be encased within a transparent spherical object. This object has characteristics similar to a snow globe, as it displays visual elements like snowflake-like patterns and a crisp, clear spherical shape. The containment of the leaf within this transparent sphere aligns with the traditional imagery associated with snow globes, where objects or scenes are placed inside a clear, round shell.",

      "question": "Is the snow globe placed on a surface resembling a tabletop near a window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits the snow globe resting on a solid surface that could be interpreted as a tabletop. The visible window in the background suggests proximity to such a surface, as windows are commonly found adjacent to tables or similar furniture pieces.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background softly blurred and contains warm tones such as orange or yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is indeed softly blurred, which provides a smooth visual contrast to the detailed foreground elements. Additionally, the presence of warm colors, particularly orange and yellow hues, is evident, enhancing the atmospheric quality of the lighting, possibly signifying a sunset or sunlight streaming through a window.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there golden sparkles scattered within the snow globe due to sunlight filtering through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows tiny golden spark-like particles seemingly suspended within the snow globe. The ambient lighting in the image suggests sunlight effect, which could cause such sparkles to be visible, similar to reflections or refracted light, making it appear as though sunlight induces this scattering effect.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the leaf suspended in water with visible gentle ripples and delicate snowflakes drifting around inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf is visibly enclosed within the snow globe, but there is no indication that it is suspended in water. The presence of snowflake patterns suggests an alternate medium than water, as snowflakes typically imply a dry suspension like air or a decorative simulation within the globe. Without evidence of water or ripples, the conclusion about the actual environment is different from Image A, where ripples in the water are evident.",
