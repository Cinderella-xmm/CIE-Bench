      "question": "Is the entire figure rendered with a dark wood texture resembling an ancient African sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure appears to have a wood-like texture, particularly noticeable on the arms and visible areas that suggest a sculpture-like appearance. This texture mimics the polished and dense surface characteristic of wooden sculptures found in traditional African art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the clothing depicted as deeply incised carved reliefs rather than fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the clothing appear embossed and have a carved relief appearance rather than fabric. The detailed design has depth and texture as one would find in carved sculptures, suggesting a sculptural representation.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the beaded crown and earrings rendered in vivid, painted colors on the wooden surface, standing out from the surrounding carving?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the beaded crown and earrings are vibrant and painted with clear definition, contrasting sharply with the wood-like texture of the surrounding areas. This vivid coloration stands out distinctly possible because of the painted finish on the wooden surface.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B does not show evidence of low-relief carvings or a sculptural transformation. Instead, it maintains the appearance of a relatively flat surface without carving depth.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features symmetrical and symbolic motifs on the clothing consistent with traditional African art, interpreted as deeply incised carvings. These designs have a carved appearance typical of artistic motifs in African sculpture.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the sculpture exhibit a polished, rich finish with subtle highlights and depth, indicating a refined wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the figure has a polished appearance with visible highlights indicative of a finished sculpture. The depth and sheen suggest a refined wooden finish, evident in the light reflections and smooth texture.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Has the subject’s facial expression, posture, and overall proportion been preserved in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the posture and overall proportion of the figure seem consistent with the original image, maintaining the subject’s form. However, due to the blurred face, the facial expression is indiscriminate in the evaluation.",
