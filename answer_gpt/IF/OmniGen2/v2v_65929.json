      "question": "Have the brick walls been changed to look like edible gingerbread?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show brick walls as they contain a reddish-brown hue and appearance consistent with typical bricks, without evident transformation. Thus, they do not resemble gingerbread, which would have more textured, cookie-like features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor is visually smooth and gray, resembling a typical concrete surface and lacks the fluid characteristics of a chocolate river. Flowing chocolate would be glossy and dynamic, unlike the static floor in Image B.",
