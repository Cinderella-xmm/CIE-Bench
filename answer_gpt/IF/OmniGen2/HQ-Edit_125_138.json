      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features a title at the top that reads 'BALI'S MAJGETIC TRADITNUS LEGCAC.'

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is depicted wearing a dress with golden patterns and vibrant red colors.

      "question": "Is the temple rendered in a line-drawn style using sepia tones instead of realistic colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the temple is displayed in realistic colors, with detailed and vibrant design elements such as stone textures and architectural features. The use of realistic imagery contrasts with sepia tones, which would typically suggest a more subdued, aged look. Therefore, the temple is not rendered in line-drawn, sepia tones.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the temple is indeed centered in the composition, serving as the focal point that anchors the visual balance.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features several blocks of text surrounding the central image. Though these texts are intended to inform about Balinese heritage, they contain typographical mutations, making them difficult to read accurately. The fonts used, however, appear to be serif, which typically conveys elegance and is often used in sophisticated print material.",
