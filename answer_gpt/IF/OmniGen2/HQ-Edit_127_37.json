      "question": "Is the knight and castle contained within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues clearly show a figure of a knight along with a castle inside a transparent glass dome. The entire scene is encapsulated by the dome, which is classic in display cases for collectible or decorative items. This enclosed presentation suggests protection or preservation, a common use for such domes. Therefore, based on this analysis, the scene is indeed contained within a transparent glass dome.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the knight been transformed into a chibi-style figure with exaggerated proportions (e.g., large head, small body)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knight in Image B is depicted with features characteristic of the chibi style, such as a proportionally larger head compared to the body size. This stylization is typical in art to create a cute or whimsical appearance. Therefore, the knight has indeed been transformed into a chibi-style figure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the knight holding a shield made of polished metal with visible reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight's shield does not exhibit characteristics of polished metal such as visible reflections or shine. Instead, it looks like it's made of a material that has a uniform matte finish, consistent with the miniaturized and stylized nature of the chibi display. Thus, the shield is not made of polished metal with visible reflections.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image earthy and muted (e.g., browns, grays, soft greens), consistent with a medieval atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly features bright and vivid colors, with greens on the base and other elements appearing in soft tones. However, these do not convey the muted, earthy tones typical of a traditional medieval atmosphere; rather, they complement the chibi and whimsical theme of the scene. Therefore, the dominant colors are not earthy and muted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small groups of sheep visible grazing near the knight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a single sheep visible near the knight. It is not a group, as only one sheep is present near the knight under the glass dome, and this suggests a focus on individual elements rather than a scene with multiple animals grazing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a dragon visible, curled around a turret, and appearing to be asleep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small dragon visible, but it is not curled around a turret. Instead, it appears to be positioned calmly beside the knight inside the glass dome, suggesting a peaceful coexistence. It does not seem to be asleep but rather relaxed as part of the scene's whimsical theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the overall scene within the dome suggest a whimsical, imaginative narrative (e.g., peaceful coexistence of knight, dragon, and animals)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene inside the glass dome in Image B is indeed whimsical and imaginative. The chibi-style knight, along with a small dragon and a sheep, creates a setting that suggests peaceful coexistence among typically fantastical elements, indicative of a playful and imaginative narrative. This is a departure from traditional contexts of conflict and tension between knights and dragons.",
