    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the building's facade composed of visible, blocky LEGO-like bricks forming the overall structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building clearly features the distinct blocky texture characteristic of LEGO bricks, both in its structure and design. The entire building is made using individual LEGO pieces that form a rectangular, interlocking pattern across its surface, which mimics the general appearance of a LEGO build. This style contributes to a synthetic, toy-like realism that diverges from typical architectural materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the buildingâ€™s bricks rendered in muted red tones and the window frames in muted blue tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the LEGO-like building is constructed using bricks in muted red and green tones. The color of the bricks is not particularly bold, having a subdued, classic LEGO set vibe. However, the window frames also seem to have a dark color but not explicitly blue, instead appearing to match a dark LEGO grey tone. Hence, while the bricks are in a muted red, the window frames do not adhere to a blue tone.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the climbing plants been replaced with green, segmented LEGO-style vines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays green structures resembling plants, strategically placed along the corners of the building. These structures mimic the segmented and textured look of LEGO pieces that can be connected together similarly to vines. This transformation gives the impression of imitation plant growth using LEGO parts. Therefore, these greenery elements do exhibit the distinctive segmented characteristic seen in LEGO bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all balconies feature gray, blocky LEGO-style railings instead of realistic metal or decorative designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each balcony on the building is equipped with a railing constructed from what appears to be grey LEGO bricks. These components are blocky and lack the intricate designs typical of realistic metal railings seen in architectural balconies. This simplification into a LEGO format eschews the need for elaborate details, relying instead on the modular, geometric aesthetics of LEGO.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO building situated on a flat, simple platform that contrasts with the surrounding environment to highlight its blocky aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the building standing on a solid, flat platform that appears stark and simplistic, diverging from any realistic landscape features. This platform supports the building without additional environmental details, emphasizing the blocky structure of the LEGO build and serving as a neutral backdrop to accentuate the toy-like architecture. The absence of surrounding environment serves to emphasize its LEGO design.",
