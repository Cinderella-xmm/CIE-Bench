      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the core visual elements such as the swirling patterns and celestial elements are visibly adapted to what seems like a glow-in-the-dark design. The vibrant, swirling shapes and distinct crescent moon and stars echo the original imagery in a simplified fashion, indicative of a glow-in-the-dark wall sticker. These elements resemble the recognizable aspects of 'The Starry Night' from Image A.",

      "question": "Is the glow-in-the-dark effect visible on the wall sticker depiction, indicating that it would illuminate in dark conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of bright neon hues against a darker background suggests a glow-in-the-dark effect. The colors are chosen to represent luminosity common in glow-in-the-dark materials. This visual choice imitates the typical appearance of such materials both in light and darkness, implying it would illuminate in a darkened room.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an interior setting with a bed and side tables, positioned directly below the wall art, which indicates a bedroom environment. This arrangement is typical for a substantial feature wall design like a large wall sticker, signifying its use in a bedroom.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bedroom setting in Image B shows a bed centrally aligned with lighting evidenced by lamps on bedside tables, making it a sensible choice for placing a glow-in-the-dark wall sticker in terms of visibility and aesthetic appeal. The room's decor complements and showcases the wall art.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B employs a vibrant and simplified color palette characteristic of glow-in-the-dark designs, it retains the general swirling and celestial motifs of Image A. However, the color and stylistic shift diminishes the intricate painterly qualities of the original artwork. Thus, although the fundamental composition is preserved, the precise artistic style and aesthetic detailing are altered.",
