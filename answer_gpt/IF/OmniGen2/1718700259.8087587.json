        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the police car displays characteristics typical of LEGO design, such as the blocky structure, visible interlocking studs, and basic geometric shapes.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO car with body panels that have distinctly vibrant and uniform blue and black coloring. The standard LEGO color palette often includes bright and consistent colors, which match the description of using blue and black LEGO bricks for the car's body.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the emergency lights on top of the LEGO car with shades typical of translucent LEGO pieces, appearing in red and blue. The headlights also show a slight variation in shading suggesting translucency as seen in such pieces. LEGO often utilizes translucent bricks for lights, fitting the description.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows of the LEGO car are shown in a solid block form without any transparency, appearing as the same tone as the rest of the car's body. However, this description does not match the beige color but rather a blue color, commonly associated with LEGO car builds instead of transparent or clear pieces.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grille and wheels depicted in Image B are consistent with standardized LEGO kits, showing a basic modular construction that appears detailed when considered in the context of LEGO. The wheels are rounded but retain visible brick-like features, indicating a construction using LEGO elements.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
