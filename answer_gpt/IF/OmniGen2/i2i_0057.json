    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central figure in the edited image now a robot horse rather than a biological horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is depicted with features suggesting artificial construction: segmented limbs, metallic sheen, and round articulations that mimic joints in robotics. These aspects are characteristic of robot design rather than biological anatomy, implying that it's a robot horse.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image maintain the same posture as the original horse, with its head lowered as if grazing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot horse is positioned with its head lowered towards the ground. This posture resembles the typical grazing stance of biological horses, consistent with the original horse's posture. Both figures have a similar stance suggesting a feeding or grazing behavior, but in Image B, it is depicted with mechanical attributes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image have a silver-white metallic shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B indicate the horse's body has a silver-white coloration with a metallic shine, suggesting a shell or casing typically associated with robots. This aspect distinguishes it from biological creatures and highlights robotic design aspects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are exposed joint mechanisms visible on the biomechanical horse in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot horse displays circular components at the limb joints, revealing mechanical structures often associated with machinery. These visible joints are characteristic of robotic construction, emphasizing its biomechanical nature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image have glowing red sensor eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is depicted with red circular features in the approximate region of its eyes. This resembles typical robotic eye sensors, known for emitting light to denote electronic activity, as seen in many fictional and real robotics designs.",
