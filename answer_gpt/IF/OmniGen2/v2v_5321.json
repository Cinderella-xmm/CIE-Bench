      "question": "Does the image exhibit a hand-sculpted claymation style with visible textures and a three-dimensional effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character and the environment present a smooth, sculpted appearance typical of a claymation style. The contours are crisp, surfaces appear slightly rounded, and overall, there is a three-dimensional effect that mimics the hand-crafted look of claymation figures, suggesting a tangible texture.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes on the character's costume are distinct and appear evenly spaced, consistent with a claymation style where textures and patterns are crafted deliberately for clarity and impact. This emphasis mirrors the claymation technique of defining patterns via sculpting.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B portrays a European rooftop scene with visual cues such as tiled roofs and chimney structures. These features are simplified yet recognizable, characteristic of a claymation adaptation where architectural elements are stylized but maintain their essence.",
