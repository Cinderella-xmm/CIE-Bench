    "Question": "Q2: Are intricate arabesque patterns visible on the surface of the genie lamp, and do they exhibit a shimmering or reflective quality?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a genie lamp adorned with elaborate patterns and designs typical of arabesque art.

    "explanation": "The smoke in Image B is depicted as swirling and ethereal, yet it doesn't form a translucent or recognizable silhouette of a genie.
