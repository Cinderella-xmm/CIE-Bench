      "question": "Does the image exhibit flat color fields, bold outlines, and minimal shading consistent with traditional Japanese woodblock prints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows characteristics reminiscent of Japanese woodblock prints, such as the use of flat color areas with little to no shading.

      "question": "Is the figureâ€™s facial expression calm and composed, with eyes slightly closed or downcast, indicating serene contemplation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face of the figure is intentionally blurred, presumably to focus attention on the other elements of the image. Due to the lack of visible facial features, the expression cannot be accurately analyzed based on visual information, hence making the inquiry about the expression's indication speculative.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
