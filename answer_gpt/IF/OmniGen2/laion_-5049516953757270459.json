      "question": "Is the entire heart-shaped board composed solely of LEGO bricks forming a mosaic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heart-shaped board is primarily made up of LEGO bricks that form a mosaic of different food items. The entire surface appears to be covered with LEGO, illustrating various colors and forms representative of different foods. This conclusion is derived from the appearance of LEGO brick structures covering the board entirely.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks used to represent the food items colored appropriately to match the original produce (e.g., blue for blueberries, red for tomatoes)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks are used to substitute food items with corresponding colors that match the real-world produce colors. For instance, blue bricks seem to represent blueberries, red bricks possibly represent tomatoes, and the other colors such as green and brown are also indicative of the respective produce on the original board. This is derived from the matching colors of the LEGO bricks with the known colors of the real produce.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are different LEGO brick sizes and shapes used to simulate textures (e.g., smooth bricks for avocado, small round bricks for berries, larger chunky bricks for broccoli)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, various LEGO brick sizes and shapes are used to mimic the texture of food items. The avocado, for example, seems to be represented with smoother pieces, while elements like strawberries and broccoli appear to utilize different brick shapes to suggest texture. This observation is based on the structured variation in the LEGO assembly mimicking food textures.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all food items in the LEGO mosaic have clearly defined and distinct borders separating them from adjacent items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO mosaic clearly shows distinct and defined borders among different food items, which is characteristic of LEGO creations. Each 'food' section is demarcated by lines where the bricks meet or change color, providing a well-defined border between them.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall shape of the LEGO mosaic remain a perfect heart, matching the original boardâ€™s silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall shape of the LEGO mosaic in Image B retains the heart shape as seen in the original design. The border formed by the LEGO pieces aligns with a heart silhouette, consistent with the original configuration of the board in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the LEGO mosaic placed on a solid, neutral gray base with no visible texture or pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B consists of a solid, neutral gray area where the LEGO mosaic rests. There is no visible pattern or texture on this base, providing a consistent and uniform backdrop for the LEGO arrangement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the LEGO mosaic exhibit a clear pixelated, blocky appearance consistent with a LEGO construction, rather than a smooth or realistic rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic has a decidedly pixelated and blocky appearance, which is characteristic of LEGO constructions. The segmentation of colors, sizes, and shapes reflect the individual LEGO pieces, distinguishing this visual from a smooth or realistic rendering typically seen in original food layouts.",
