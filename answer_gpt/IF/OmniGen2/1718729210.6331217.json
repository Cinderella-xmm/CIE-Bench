      "question": "Is the scarecrow presented within a box-like packaging structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarecrow is positioned within a structure that resembles a rectangular box, with clear edges and a base, giving the appearance of packaging. The visual cues of straight lines and distinct edges surrounding the scarecrow, combined with the cultural knowledge of packaging displays, suggest that it is within a box-like structure.",

      "question": "Does the background feature a nighttime farm scene with a dark sky, stars, and a field under moonlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background depicts a dark sky dotted with stars, indicative of nighttime. The presence of a hill-side or field-like area and the moon-like light source reinforces the depiction of a typical farm scene. Combined with the knowledge that these are common elements in nighttime farm scenes, it confirms the setting.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the scarecrow's body been replaced with glossy, weather-resistant materials instead of natural straw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the scarecrow maintains a texture resembling natural straw, with no visual indication of glossy or weather-resistant materials replacing it. The consistency in the straw-like material and lack of reflective or synthetic material cues align with traditional scarecrow construction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the scarecrow's hat designed with a visible cavity or opening suitable for holding a candle, indicating it is a detachable candle holder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarecrow's hat appears solid and without an apparent cavity or opening that would suggest it is designed to hold a candle. The visual continuity of the hat and absence of typical candle holder features suggest it is not intended for such a purpose.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are small, spherical lights surrounding the base of the box-like structure, emitting a gentle glow characteristic of LED string lights. This visual detail, along with the knowledge that LED lights often have this appearance and are used decoratively, confirms their presence.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual inspection of Image B shows a crow figure positioned on the right arm of the scarecrow, near the top of the structure. This placement and the decorative nature of the figurine match the description of a decorative crow on top of a packaging structure.",
