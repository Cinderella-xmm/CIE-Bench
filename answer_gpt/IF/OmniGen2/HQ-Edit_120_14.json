      "question": "Has the overall form of the bicycle been transformed into a creature-like structure resembling a steampunk insect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle has been creatively modified to resemble a steampunk insect-like entity. This conclusion comes from the visual elements in Image B, which show wing-like extensions and cogwheels usually associated with steampunk motifs. The overall appearance takes on a fantastical and mechanical insect-like form, combining elements such as gears and other steampunk features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the frame components replaced with an exoskeleton structure featuring visible cogwheel joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B reveals that the bicycle has visible cogwheel joints integrated into its design, particularly around the seat and the mid-section of the bike. This transforms the bicycle's frame components into something reminiscent of an exoskeleton with mechanical joints, typical in steampunk concepts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the bicycle seat been transformed into a detailed, ornate carapace resembling an insect's back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bicycle seat in Image B features detailing that suggests a more ornate form, but it does not fully transform into a detailed carapace resembling an insect's back. While steampunk elements such as gears are added, they do not suggest it has been explicitly transformed into an insect's back or carapace.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have both wheels been replaced with hinged, mechanical leg structures instead of traditional circular wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both wheels remain in circular form and do not appear as hinged, mechanical leg structures. Though they feature clock faces integrated into the design, they still retain the traditional circular wheel shape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows copper-colored wing-like extensions attached to the bicycle, enhancing the insect-like steampunk aesthetic. These extensions are positioned in a manner consistent with the theme of a creature-like structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handlebar area features antique-style clock faces with traditional numbers rather than mysterious runes. The clock faces include standard numerals, highlighting the steampunk theme but not adding runes or symbols beyond standard timekeeping numbers.",
