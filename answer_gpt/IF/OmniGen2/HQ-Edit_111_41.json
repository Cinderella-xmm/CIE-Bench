    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the chair constructed entirely from visible LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual analysis of Image B shows that the chair appears to be constructed with straight lines and smooth surfaces, rather than with distinct, interlocking LEGO-style brick parts. There are no visible LEGO studs or structured brick patterns typical of LEGO construction. Without these characteristics, it doesn't suggest a LEGO-style build.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the seat and backrest cushions rendered in sleek black, resembling LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seat and backrest cushions in Image B are sleek and black, and they have a grid-like segment pattern. While each segment could conceptually resemble a LEGO piece, the absence of distinct LEGO studs and the continuity of the surface differentiates from actual LEGO bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the armrests and base of the chair rendered in silver color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the armrests with black tops and metallic supports, and the base in a metallic hue. The base itself appears to be rendered in a silver color, which common knowledge identifies as silver. The armrest also shows metallic elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wheels translucent gray in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the visual analysis of Image B, the wheels are clearly rendered in solid black, with no translucence or gray coloration evident. This does not align with the characteristic of translucent gray.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the seat and backrest composed of visibly layered bricks with smooth gradients between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seat and backrest in Image B have a series of segments or panels, but these appear to be smooth and continuous in texture. There are no visible bricks or gradients between layers, indicating that the surface isn't constructed of layered bricks with gradients.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the armrests designed as simple hinged parts without complex padding or curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armrests have straight, uncomplicated lines with what appears to be a horizontally flat surface. While they do have a modern design, they do not exhibit complex curves or thick padding, aligning more with a simple, linear design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the chair placed on a plain white tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chair positioned against a white background that extends beneath it, which visually simulates the appearance of being on a plain white surface, similar to a tabletop. There are no distinguishing features to suggest otherwise.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the image clearly highlight the geometric, modular construction of the chair through visible brick edges and clean lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chair in Image B is characterized by clean, straight lines, and a structured appearance that could connote modularity. However, no prominent brick edges are visible, implying it isn't constructed to highlight a brick-like modularity as typical LEGO bricks would.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
