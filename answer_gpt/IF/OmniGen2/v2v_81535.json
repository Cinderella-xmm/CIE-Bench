      "question": "Have the fresh green cilantro sprigs been replaced with tiny, ornate blue dragons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cilantro sprigs seen in Image A remain unchanged and are still present on top of the dish. Analysis suggests that the blue dragons are not replacing the cilantro but rather appear to be added next to the dish on both sides. Therefore, the fresh green cilantro sprigs have not been replaced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the scales of the blue dragons mirror the delicate blue floral design of the white porcelain bowl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue dragons in Image B possess a detailed scale pattern, characteristic of dragon imagery. The bowl they are in features a blue floral design that is actually a traditional pattern unrelated to the intricate scales of the dragons. Logically, the dragon's scales don't mimic the floral pattern but are instead distinctly different.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the blue dragons shown breathing faint wisps of orange curry-scented smoke?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragons, while vibrant in their blue color and detailed in their design, are not shown emitting any form of smoke. The concept of curry-scented smoke is also not visually represented or suggested in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the chicken pieces been transformed into dragon eggs made of shimmering, solidified curry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the previous chicken pieces are seen as larger, oval objects that appear smoother and more uniform resembling eggs, positioned similarly to how the chicken was arranged in Image A. The appearance suggests they may represent dragon eggs. Coupled with contextual cues, they seem to be intentionally represented as such.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the overall composition and context of the original image been maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The primary elements of Image A, such as the dish's shape, its placement, and background items like cans and bottles, remain consistent in Image B. However, the addition of dragons and egg-like shapes alters the scene's focus and thematic context, from a dish of curry to a fantasy-inspired representation.",
