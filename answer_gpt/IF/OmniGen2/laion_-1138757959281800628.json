      "question": "Is the entire hotel and pool scene enclosed within a visible glass terrarium structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe a glass dome encapsulating the entire scene, which includes the hotel, pool, and other elements, resembling a terrarium or snow globe model. The glass is evident by its clear surface and reflections, indicating the scene is within a glass container. This visual cue combined with common knowledge about terrarium designs leads to the conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the pool display layered water effects, such as visible depth layers or textured surface ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pool appears smooth with a consistent texture and color; there are no visible depth layers or pronounced ripples that suggest textured water effects. This simplicity in visual representation matches the style often seen in miniature models or toy setups, rather than realistic water surface dynamics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sunbathers and surrounding trees visibly miniaturized in size relative to the building and pool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures of sunbathers and the nearby trees are significantly smaller in comparison to the hotel building and pool, which suggests they are miniaturized elements in this scene. This proportion is typical for diorama or model scenes where scale is adjusted for effect or display within a confined structure such as a terrarium.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there fabricated cascading greenery visibly growing from the rooftop of the hotel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooftop of the hotel is depicted clearly without any cascading greenery or rooftop vegetation. The absence of these elements suggests a clean and simplified design typical of models, differing from a realistic or detailed building with rooftop gardens. Therefore, this imagery lacks such features as cascading greenery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are small, whimsical beach accessories (e.g., toy floats, tiny buckets, or miniature umbrellas) placed near the edge of the pool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any small beach accessories like toy floats, tiny buckets, or umbrellas by the pool edge. The scene has straightforward objects and figures without whimsical elements typical of miniature setups. The lack of these details suggests a more minimalistic approach in the design of this scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there floating 3D cloud elements positioned above the scene, distinct from the background sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are evident 3D cloud elements that appear to be floating above the scene within the terrarium, distinct from an actual sky. These clouds are stylistically simple and non-realistic, reflecting design choices often seen in artistic representations or toy models rather than real-world imagery.",
