    "Question": "Q1: Are the stork's feathers replaced with metallic plates, such as riveted or segmented metal surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stork's feathers appear to have a uniform and smooth texture, suggestive of being metallic, possibly indicating segmented surfaces without traditional feather markings. This appearance aligns with common steampunk design elements, which often include metallic textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the nest materials composed entirely of cogs, gears, and mechanical parts instead of natural twigs?",
    "explanation": "An examination of Image B reveals that the nest surrounding the stork is predominantly constructed from gears and cogs, with some twigs integrated into the design. This mixture is indicative of a steampunk aesthetic, which typically incorporates mechanical elements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are copper-colored pipes visibly integrated along the roofline of the wooden house?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible pipes along the house's roofline, displaying a copper-like hue. This feature is characteristic of a steampunk design, where metallic pipes are frequently integrated into architectural elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the stork have visible mechanical joints at key limb connections (e.g., legs, neck, wings)?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the stork without visibly distinct mechanical joints such as gears or hinges on its limbs or neck, which would be expected if the design was heavily mechanized. Hence, the stork in Image B lacks the overt mechanical joint design typically seen in steampunk adaptations.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the entire scene rendered in a Steampunk style, with consistent use of mechanical components, metallic textures, and industrial design across both the stork and the house?",
    "explanation": "The scene in Image B features steampunk elements such as metallic textures on the stork, gears, cogs in the nest, and copper pipes on the house, all coherent with the steampunk style. These elements combine to present a harmonious industrial and mechanical aesthetic throughout the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
