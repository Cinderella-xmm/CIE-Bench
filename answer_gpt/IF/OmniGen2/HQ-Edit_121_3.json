    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the butterfly been transformed into a creature that visually resembles a floral being, with no recognizable insectoid body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings have leaf-like patterns, and the body resembles a green stalk with elements reminiscent of a flower, suggesting a floral transformation. However, the green segmented body, antennae, and overall structure retain insectoid characteristics despite the floral design elements.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wings appear folded into distinct, vibrant petal-like structures instead of flat, membranous insect wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents vibrant, colorful wings with gradients and leaf-like patterns that resemble petals more than typical insect wings. The design emphasizes curves and textures similar to flower petals rather than flat insect wings.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the butterfly's body now resemble a thin, upright flower stalk rather than an insectâ€™s segmented torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B showcases a green body that mimics the appearance of a flower stalk, thin and upright, contributing to the creature's floral mimicry while still maintaining a segmented structure characteristic of insects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original wing patterns replaced with detailed, naturalistic leaf designs across the entire surface of the wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B have vibrant patterns with gradients resembling leaves by having central veins and petal-like shapes which differ from the original monarch pattern.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's antennae end in curled tendril-like shapes which resemble those found on some plants, enhancing the floral appearance of the creature.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small blossoms visibly attached to the edges of the wings and at the foot/lowest part of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any small blossoms attached to the wings or at any part of the creature's body, focusing instead on leaf-like and floral-stalk attributes.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
