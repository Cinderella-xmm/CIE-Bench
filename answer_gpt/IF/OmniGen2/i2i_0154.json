        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two representations of the car: one from a side view and one from a top view. A front view typically shows the front grille, headlights, and the frontal perspective of the car. These elements are not visible in either representation in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side profile of the car is clearly shown, providing visibility to the side design, including the wheels and side mirrors, which are characteristic elements of a side view.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a view that shows the roof and general outline of the car's body from above, which is indicative of a top view.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B only contains the side and top views separately, not combined into a composite image. Each view is distinct and not overlapped or merged into a single representation involving three perspectives.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B is not a combined three-view image, the two provided views (side and top) are presented with clarity and professional scaling, which is typically important for purposes like automotive design or showcasing. However, since not all three views are combined or integrated into one image as a singular presentation, it might not fully satisfy typical requirements for certain professional uses.",
