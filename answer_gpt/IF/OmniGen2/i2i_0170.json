      "question": "Are the overall lines and contours of the image now clear and well-defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall presentation is characterized by sharp lines and clear contours due to the high-contrast colors and bold outlines. This is typical of commercial illustrations where emphasis is placed on clarity. The clarity of different elements is accentuated, such as the outlines of the mannequins, bags, and figures, which are made more prominent than in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the original textures been replaced with soft gradient blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, detailed textures like those seen in the fabric of clothing and building materials in Image A have been substituted with flat color blocks. These are characterized by smooth gradients. For example, the flooring, clothing, and wall of the display area exhibit solid colors without intricate texturing, creating a simplified visual style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image now exhibit characteristics of a high-end commercial illustration (e.g., refined and sophisticated appearance)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's visual style adopts bold colors and simplified designs typical of polished commercial illustrations often used in advertising and luxury brand presentations. The composition emphasizes brand elements, seen in the clear inclusion of the brand name 'VOGUE', and the stylized depiction of product showcases, contributing to a sophisticated appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges and boundaries between elements in the image now sharply defined and crisp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features distinctly sharp and crisp edges around various elements, such as the figures, bags, and display cases. This sharpness facilitates separation between elements and enhances clarity, aligning with a visually structured and segmented art style common in commercial graphics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do areas previously filled with detailed textures now feature smooth, soft gradients instead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms areas which originally displayed complex textures, such as clothing fabrics and ground paving, into smoother, gradient-like fields. These provide a visually cohesive and less detailed representation without the intricate texture seen in Image A, contributing to the image's stylized simplicity.",
