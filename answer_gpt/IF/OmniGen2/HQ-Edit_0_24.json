      "question": "Are the flowers in the image rendered with visibly higher color saturation compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers demonstrate vivid colors, and there is a noticeable contrast and brightness to them compared to Image A. Each flower appears more vibrant, suggesting higher saturation in the edited image. Comparison with Image A shows that its flowers are slightly muted in comparison, indicating that Image B has indeed heightened the color saturation.",

      "question": "Do the gardening tools (shovel and watering can) appear to have an antique, metallic finish with signs of aging such as tarnish or patina?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gardening tools like the shovel and watering can exhibit a clean and smooth surface without any visible signs of tarnish or patina, suggesting a new or well-maintained metal finish. In Image A, the tools similarly appear without aging signs, supporting the observation that both images portray modern or well-kept tools.",

      "question": "Is there a faint, decorative vine pattern overlaid on the background of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a decorative and ornate frame around the entire image, incorporating vine and floral motifs on its border, but does not have any faint vine patterns overlaid directly on the garden background itself. Therefore, the decorative elements are part of the border, not superimposed over the background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, there is a blank rectangular space directly over the garden scene. This space appears to be intentional for adding text or details, as commonly seen in calendar headers for months or dates. Image A does not have such space, indicating that Image B was edited to include this header.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blank header is bordered by an intricate design featuring ornate leaf and floral patterns, providing a decorative frame around the header space. This contrasting decoration is absent in Image A, demonstrating that the border was added in the edited image.",
