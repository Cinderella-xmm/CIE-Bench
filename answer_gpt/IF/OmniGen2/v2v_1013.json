      "question": "Have the two birds been transformed into realistic anime-style model figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds appear to be highly stylized with features typical of model figures. The smooth surfaces, bold colors, and lack of natural bird details suggest they have been transformed into anime-style figures rather than realistic representations of birds. This transformation involves giving them a cartoonish, polished look characteristic of anime-style models.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the anime-style bird models placed on a desktop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds appear to be placed on a smooth, flat surface that resembles a typical desktop. This conclusion is based on the presence of common desktop objects, such as a laptop and a person's hand indicating a setting consistent with a workspace or personal desk.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the image captured from a casual snapshot perspective, similar to a mobile phone photo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The perspective in Image B suggests a close-up, informal snapshot. The angle and framing imply an action similar to one where someone picks up an object to photograph it casually, rather than a carefully composed studio photo. This informal setup is typical of mobile phone photography.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the anime-style models faithfully represent the birds' full body postures, feather textures, and coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the models in Image B maintain the basic posture and coloration of the original birds, the texture is not faithful to the natural feathering of birds. Instead, they present a smooth, uniform appearance characteristic of stylized anime models which lack the detailed feather texture present in the real birds.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features highly refined and detailed rendering. The anime-style models display smooth gradients and well-defined edges, showcasing an intricately designed aesthetic. The colors are vibrant with transitions that illustrate a high level of artistic and technical detail typical of advanced model renderings.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image in Image B presents the birds in a manner reminiscent of Japanese anime figures, with their stylized features, precise lines, and vivid colors. The smooth and polished finish reinforces the anime-inspired design, highlighting a clean, refined aesthetic aligned with anime art styles.",
