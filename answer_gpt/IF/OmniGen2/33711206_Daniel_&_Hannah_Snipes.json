        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the style is more illustrative and artistic compared to a realistic representation, it does not depict the woman and child in a traditional cartoon style, which often includes exaggerated features like notably enlarged eyes.
