      "question": "Has a person been added to the image near the zebra's tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a person can be seen positioned near the zebra, specifically the tail region, indicating an editional alteration. The person stands to the side, behind the zebra, which is not present in Image A. This change points to the addition of a new element. Thus, based on visual cues, the conclusion is that a person has indeed been added near the zebra's tail.",

      "question": "Does the zebra have its head partially turned toward the person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's head is still pointed downward toward the water, similar to Image A. The position of the zebra's head does not show any orientation or turn towards the added person. Based on this observation, the zebra's focus remains on the water and not directed toward the person.",

      "question": "Is the person's foot positioned near or on the zebra's tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person's foot is located on the ground near the zebra but not close to or on the zebra's tail. Observing the relative positioning of the person’s foot and the zebra’s tail shows they are separate, with a clear space between them. Therefore, the foot is not near or on the zebra's tail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A comparison of Image B with Image A shows that the watering hole and the surrounding rocky environment are consistent with the original setup. The watering hole's shape and the rock placement in Image B appear unchanged, indicating that these elements have been maintained without modification.",

      "question": "Does the zebra's expression and posture indicate it is startled?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is observed with its head down, apparently drinking water. Its body posture and expression, including leg positioning and relaxed demeanor, do not show signs of it being startled, contrasting with what would typically be a more upright head or alert body posture. Furthermore, comparing this with Image A affirms that the zebra remains calm and engaged with its environment.",
