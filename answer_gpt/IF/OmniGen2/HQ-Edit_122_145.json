      "question": "Is the figure depicted in a chibi style with an oversized head, large eyes, and simplified proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi style is characterized by oversized heads, large eyes, and simplified, exaggerated body proportions to create a cute appearance. In Image B, the figures have clearly disproportionate heads relative to their bodies, simplified features, and convey cuteness, adhering to the chibi style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns and bows on the kimono significantly more vibrant and exaggerated in color and size compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the kimono are less detailed with brighter, more vibrant colors, typical of stylization meant for a cartoonish effect like chibi art. This contrasts with Image A, where the floral patterns and bows on the kimono are more intricate and realistic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly four separate images of the chibi character, each in a unique pose corresponding to holding a cherry blossom branch, catching petals, gazing at blooming trees, and dancing amidst falling flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains four separate images of the chibi character, each with slight variations in poses and surroundings that hint at different themes such as holding branches and being amidst petals, but without explicit dynamic interaction or specific motions as described.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does each of the four images depict a clear and distinct action—holding a branch, catching petals, gazing at trees, or dancing—with visible movement or interaction with cherry blossoms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The individual images suggest themes related to nature and cherry blossoms, but it is not explicit that each one illustrates a dynamic, identifiable action such as catching petals or dancing. They are more suggestive of poses rather than active participation with the elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the four fridge magnets displayed together on a single pastel-colored surface that appears to be a magnetic sheet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the four chibi figures are displayed together on a uniform pastel background, which appears cohesive but does not distinctly represent a magnetic sheet typically seen in conjunction with fridge magnets.",
