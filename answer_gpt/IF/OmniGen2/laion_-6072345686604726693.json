      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the Hagia Sophia been transformed into a creature-like figure with a distinct body, head, or limb-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, we observe a grand, luminous, winged figure towering over the Hagia Sophia, which appears creature-like. This entity has a distinct body and expansive wings, suggesting transformation into a creature-like figure. The reasoning involves combining visual cues—such as the wings and celestial design elements—with common knowledge about fantastical and cosmic designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the smaller domes on the sides of the structure appear as large, metallic, wing-like appendages extending outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smaller structure elements do not transform into wing-like appendages. Instead, the wings are part of the ethereal figure placed above the original building. The visual cues show a distinction between the wings and the domes, indicating no transformation to wing-like appendages.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the four minarets been replaced with long, slender, leg-like structures that support the body of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the integrity of the historical minarets, which appear consistent with leg-like structures supporting a fantastical element—a celestial winged figure hovering above, separate from the building and its minarets. No structural transformation appears in the visual analysis of the minarets.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there glowing, intricate patterns resembling Byzantine art covering parts of the structure’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts glowing and intricate details primarily part of the hovering celestial figure above the structure rather than on the structure itself. The patterns connect with cosmic and ethereal themes and do not extend to the Hagia Sophia’s surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the central dome been replaced with a large, jewel-like object that displays cosmic imagery such as stars, nebulae, or galaxies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the original central dome remains, the addition of the large, luminous figure above integrates cosmic themes, though not replacing the dome itself. The glowing center part of the figure includes cosmic imagery without replacing architectural elements.",
