      "question": "Is the tall building replaced with a towering automaton featuring a sleek, white, armored body and mechanical windows as apertures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large robot or automaton with a sleek, white, and armored body standing prominently where the tall building is situated in Image A. The robot exhibits futuristic design elements including glowing sections and sleek armor plating. This is an edited alteration from Image A, where there is a tall building with normal windows. The presence of the robotic structure instead of the building is the main focus in the edit.",

      "question": "Has the traditional Japanese roof been converted into stylized shoulder pads with embedded intricate patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the traditional Japanese building with its distinct tiled roof remains unchanged beneath the towering robot. Its original structure and design with wooden elements are intact, and there are no signs of it being transformed into any type of armor or shoulder pads with intricate patterns.",

      "question": "Are all traffic signs replaced with holographic symbols that appear to float or emit light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the traffic signs such as the 'STOP' sign and directional signs are retained in their original form without any holographic or light-emitting alterations. They appear solid and mounted on poles as they would in Image A. There are no holographic effects present in the image.",

      "question": "Are the pedestrians in the street replaced with robotic figures featuring geometric designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beside the towering robot, small robotic figures with geometric designs replace the human pedestrians seen in Image A. These robots have a design consistent with modern robotic aesthetics and occupy the same positions and scale as the individuals walking in the original photo.",

      "question": "Has the streetscape been altered to include robotic elements and geometric designs consistent with a futuristic urban environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of the large robot and smaller robotic figures alters the streetscape significantly. These elements introduce a futuristic and robotic theme, transforming the environment's appearance to align with a science fiction aesthetic. However, the overall infrastructural setup like the traditional building and other static elements remain unaltered.",
