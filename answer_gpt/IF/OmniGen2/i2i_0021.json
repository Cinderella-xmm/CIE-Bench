      "question": "Have the three sheep been transformed into chibi-style sticker characters while maintaining their original pose near the fence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep are depicted as chibi-style sticker characters, characterized by their cute and simplistic design with exaggerated features typical of chibi art. Their pose near the fence from Image A isn't maintained in Image B; instead, they are represented standing behind a wooden fence in a symmetrical arrangement. Image A shows three animals interacting with a fence in real life, whereas Image B focuses on stylized characters with a fence in the background. Therefore, while the animals are transformed into chibi-style characters, their original pose is not maintained.",

      "question": "Are the three chibi-style sheep equipped with the specified unique accessories: one with a red scarf, one with a knit hat, and one with a small bell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues from Image B confirm that each chibi-style sheep has specific accessories: one wears a red scarf, another has a red knit hat, and the third carries a small bell. These accessories align with the specified unique accessories mentioned in the question.",

      "question": "Do the chibi-style sheep feature thick white outlines and flat cartoon line-art coloring as instructed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows that the chibi-style sheep are outlined with thick white lines, distinguishing them from the background and contributing to a sticker-like appearance. The coloring is flat and consistent with the cartoon line-art style, featuring simple and bright colors. These characteristics match the typical style instructions.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background of the edited image transparent, making it suitable for use as a journaling sticker or IM emoji?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, the background is visible as white rather than transparent. For a sticker or emoji to be versatile in various applications, typically a transparent background is preferred so the sticker can blend seamlessly with different surfaces. Since the background is clearly white, it suggests that it isn't transparent, limiting some versatility in its usage.",

      "question": "Does the final image visually match the specified style and is it functional as a sticker for journaling or online communication?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually exemplifies the specified chibi style with thick white outlines and flat cartoon coloring, rendering it effective as a sticker or emoji for journaling or communication. However, since it lacks a transparent background (as discussed in Q4), its functionality is somewhat limited for these purposes, as a white background might not blend well with several surfaces.",
