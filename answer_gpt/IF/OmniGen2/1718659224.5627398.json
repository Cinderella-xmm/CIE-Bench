      "question": "Is the fortress constructed entirely from golden-brown cookie dough with darker edges resembling baked edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress is depicted in a highly stylized and simplified manner, resembling a decorative object rather than a real structure. The castle's color is a uniform golden-brown, and the texture is smooth without obvious variations or materials seen in real constructions, suggesting it could be made from cookie dough or similar material. The darker edges around the structures can be perceived as resembling baked edges, typical of items like cookies. Combining these visual cues with knowledge of decorative desserts, it's reasonable to conclude the fortress is meant to represent cookie dough.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the walls and towers of the fortress have a golden-brown base color with visibly darker edges, mimicking baked cookie dough?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The walls and towers in Image B show a consistent golden-brown color, with darker edges that resemble baked cookies. This is a stylistic feature used often in decorative pastry art to mimic baked goods like gingerbread or cookies. Given the smooth texture and uniform color typical of such artistic representations, it indicates the intention to portray the structures as made from cookie dough.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls depicted as finely piped, smooth, and glossy streams resembling royal icing rather than natural water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waterfalls in Image B are smooth, glossy, and have a consistent blue color without the dynamic qualities and transparency of natural water. These visual characteristics align with representations of royal icing, which is often used in decorative desserts for its smooth finish and ability to hold shape. The context of a cake-like presentation reinforces this interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees in the image made from smooth, uniformly green-colored marzipan with no realistic leaf detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are simplistic, with a uniform green color and smooth surfaces, lacking detailed leaf patterns or variations typical of real trees. Such characteristics are common in decorative pastries using marzipan or fondant, where realistic texture and detail are often minimized for aesthetic purposes. This analysis supports the conclusion that the trees are crafted to resemble marzipan.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cookie castle placed on a large, flat, white ceramic platter that is clearly visible beneath and around the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the castle and surrounding decorative elements placed centrally on a large, flat, white ceramic platter. The platter provides a clean, contrasting background typical for showcasing cake decorations or artistic food items, emphasizing the objects represented as edible or models. This visual placement and contrast are consistent with the presentation style for decorative food items.",
