    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the entire alpine scene transformed into a unified, creature-like form rather than separate landscape elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a significant change where a glowing, transparent figure resembling a creature is prominently positioned in front of the chalet. This figure has wings and a body forming a unified, distinct element, contrasting with the separate landscape elements like the stream and the grass. Thus, the edited image depicts a creature-like form central to the scene, while other landscape components appear somewhat disconnected and not part of this form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the chalet's roof visibly transformed into a shell-like structure with intricate, icy etching patterns covering its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the chalet retains its triangular roof with wooden textures visible, resembling more of a consistent and solid design rather than resembling a shell-like structure or having icy etching patterns. The property of the roof doesn't fit the described transformation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the former snow patches now shaped like wings and rendered with a shimmering, translucent appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a creature with large wings that are indeed shimmering and translucent. These wings resemble glacial patterns but do not seem to derive directly from the snow patches. The snow remains unchanged in its location, and its presence separate from the wings indicates a different source of transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the rocky areas at the base of the scene appear as thick, leg-like structures covered in mossy textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rocky areas remain as they were, identifiable as distinct landscape elements in Image B. They do not visually resemble leg-like structures and are not highlighted or transformed in any significant way similar to the creature-like features throughout the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the stream depicted as glowing, luminous lines resembling veins embedded within the creatureâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stream remains a clear water body running through the scene, and while it reflects light, it does not exhibit characteristics of luminous lines that would closely resemble veins as part of the creature's body. The creature's figure has its own glowing outlines and patterns separate from the stream.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the overall atmosphere of the image misty, hazy, and dreamlike, with soft lighting and a sense of otherworldliness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The atmosphere in Image B indeed appears misty and hazy, similar to Image A but enhanced by the presence of the glowing creature. Soft lighting and the ethereal presence of this figure lend the image a dreamlike and otherworldly ambiance, suggesting a surreal transformation of the landscape.",
