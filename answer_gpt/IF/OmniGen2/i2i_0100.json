    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image include a top-down view of the sink structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the perspective shown is from a straightforward, frontal view of the sink structures, not from a top-down perspective. This is evident from the drawn lines and orientation, which indicate a direct view rather than a bird's-eye view, typically characterized by more of an overview of the top surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image include an angled side view of the sink structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features front-facing illustrations of sinks with no indication of angled side perspectives. Sink drawings represent a flat, two-dimensional look aimed at detailing the front and top edges of the sink, lacking any angled perspective view.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the top-down view and the angled side view merged into a single image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As determined from the analysis that there are no top-down or angled side views present in the illustrated image, the question of merging those views into one does not apply.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the layout of the top-down and angled side views clear and well-organized in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there are neither top-down views nor angled side views included in the edited image as previously established, commenting on the clarity and organization of such views in relation to the layout is not applicable.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do both the top-down view and the angled side view accurately depict the sink structure seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original image shows a real-life double sink vanity setup from a frontal perspective. The edited image does not illustrate this setup from either a top-down or angled side view. The illustrations depict generic sink styles without specifying the exact design seen in the original image, which was more detailed and realistic.",
