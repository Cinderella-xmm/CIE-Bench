      "question": "Have the cheetahs' leg joints been replaced with polished brass pistons and gears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs of the cheetahs appear natural and similar to what is seen on actual cheetahs, comprised of fur with spots and not mechanical components like brass pistons or gears. By observing the legs in the edited image, common sense and visual cues suggest that the joints remain biological and unmodified by mechanical parts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the cheetahs' spotted fur been partially replaced with tooled leather and copper plating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture and appearance of the cheetahs' fur remain consistent with the natural spotted fur seen on actual cheetahs, without signs of tooled leather or copper plating. Visual cues, combined with the understanding of cheetah fur, suggest natural animal fur is used rather than any artificial or mechanic materials.",

      "question": "Have the cheetahs' eyes been replaced with glowing amber lenses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs' eyes are rendered realistically in the same way seen in actual animals, showing typical biological features without any glowing appearance or artificial lens-like characteristics. Common sense and visual analysis indicate that the eyes retain their natural form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background prominently features detailed clock-like structures that appear fantastical and differ significantly from natural savanna landscapes. These structures contain elements commonly associated with clockworks, suggesting they are indeed towering and non-natural additions to the scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky contains clouds that exhibit a vibrant, copper-like tone, differing from typical white or gray clouds seen in natural settings. The distinct warm color of the clouds suggests artistic enhancement for a metallic appearance, fitting the description of 'coppery clouds.'",
