      "question": "Has the central touchscreen been transformed into expressive calligraphic strokes and graded ink washes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the touchscreen retains the typical rectangular shape and displays similar interface elements as in Image A, but with a stylized artistic effect. While the outlines and presentation might have a more textured appearance, they don't fully resemble traditional calligraphic strokes or ink washes. The effect is evident, but the form remains digital and consistent with that of a vehicle touchscreen.",

      "question": "Have the screen's interface and airflow graphics dissolved into expressive calligraphic strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The screen interface and airflow graphics in Image B have gained an artistic effect with more fluid, soft-edged rendering, which creates an ink-like texture. However, the graphics are not depicted as traditional calligraphic strokes; their primary function as digital interface icons remains intact, albeit with an artistic filter applied.",

      "question": "Has the dark wood paneling been replaced with bold, freehand brushwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The paneling in Image B exhibits a more artistic rendition, appearing smoother and less defined compared to Image A. Though it is stylized, it does not entirely transform into freehand brushwork akin to traditional painting techniques. It remains recognizable as paneling.",

      "question": "Does the edited image capture the spirit of technological flow through an ancient artistic lens?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents modern vehicle interior elements with a stylized rendering that lends an artistic and expressive quality. The combination of technology with visual effects reminiscent of older artistic methods, such as ink-like texture and softer edges, aligns with the notion of blending technological flow with ancient artistic techniques.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout in Image B maintains the core structure and placement of elements seen in Image A, such as the positioning of the steering wheel, screens, and dashboard elements. Despite the artistic enhancements, the fundamental composition remains consistent with typical vehicle interiors.",
