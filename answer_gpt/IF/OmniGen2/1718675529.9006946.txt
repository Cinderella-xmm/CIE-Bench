    "Question": "Q1: Is the image rendered in a stylized, graphic manner consistent with Art Deco design principles, rather than a photorealistic style?",
    "explanation": "Image B is characterized by flat, bold shapes and a simplified color palette that resembled graphic design styles like Art Deco. The palm tree, waves, sun, and clouds are reduced to geometric forms and use a limited range of colors which are typical in Art Deco design. There is no attempt to depict realistic textures or depth, unlike Image A which is photorealistic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the ocean waves represented using bold, simplified geometric curves instead of naturalistic wave forms?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the waves are represented using sweeping arcs and curves, ignoring the intricate details of real waves and instead opting for geometric simplicity. This contrasts with Image A, where the waves are depicted in a naturalistic style, aiming to show realistic movement and texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the palm trees depicted as stylized vertical lines without detailed fronds or natural tree structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows palm trees with simple curves and lines, without any detailed depiction of fronds or the trunk's texture, embracing a graphic, stylized form. Image A shows a photorealistic depiction with detailed fronds and trunk textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the clouds in the sky rendered as symmetrical, geometric shapes rather than natural cloud forms?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the clouds in simple, rounded geometric shapes that do not mimic the irregular forms seen in real clouds. They offer a stylized representation unlike Image A, where clouds have a more naturalistic appearance with varied shapes and shading.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the image use a color palette dominated by muted greens, blues, and warm oranges, avoiding bright or highly saturated colors?",
    "explanation": "Image B employs a color scheme with muted tones, including greens and blues for the water and palm tree, and warm oranges for the sky and beach, avoiding bright colors. This creates a cohesive and stylized look. Unlike Image A, which uses a broader range of vibrant and natural colors seen during a sunset.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the essential elements of the beach scene—sand, ocean, horizon, and sky—still present and recognizable despite the stylization?",
    "explanation": "Despite the stylized nature of Image B, it retains recognizable elements of a beach scene: sand is depicted as a flat area, the ocean is shown with simplified wave forms, the horizon is clearly visible, and the sky includes geometric clouds and a sun. These elements are articulated differently but remain identifiable. Image A depicts them in photorealistic detail, confirming their presence in both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
