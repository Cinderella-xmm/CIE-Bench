      "question": "Is the background rendered in the style of an oil painting, showing visible textured brush strokes and a painterly quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not prominently display signs of being rendered in an oil painting style.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B showcases bold contrasting colors, including bright yellows, blue skies, and the typical dry landscape. However, it lacks the textured brush strokes indicative of a painterly style. The colors are vibrant and artistically applied, enhancing the overall image composition without the addition of textured brush effects.",
