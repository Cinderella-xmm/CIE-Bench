      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent glass cloche?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a transparent glass cloche covering a scene. This is evident from the glass reflections and the shape of the cloche that encompasses what's underneath. A cloche typically has a dome shape with a knob on top, as seen here, which is a common feature for displaying and protecting items, especially in vintage or ornamental settings.",

      "question": "Is the book depicted as an open pop-up structure with visible miniature carved figures inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of an open book structure with miniature carved figures. The book seen in the image is closed and upright without any indication of opening or figures emerging from it. A pop-up structure would require visible elements popping out or standing up in a three-dimensional manner which is not present here.",

      "question": "Is the quill positioned centrally and acting as a pivot point within the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The quill in Image B is indeed positioned centrally within the diorama. It stands upright on a golden structure, giving the appearance of being a focal or pivot point around which the display is organized. This central positioning is common in displays to draw attention and create a sense of balance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the inkwell been transformed into a glistening fountain with reflective, flowing water-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of the inkwell being transformed into a fountain. The image shows a traditional inkwell set up with a feather quill, without any semblance of flowing or water-like features. Instead, the inkwell retains its traditional appearance with a brass or golden look.",

      "question": "Is the base of the diorama a wooden disk featuring an etched map of imagined lands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the diorama is indeed a wooden disk, and it features a map. The map looks classic and could represent imagined lands or vintage mapping styles. The wooden base adds to the antique aesthetic, which aligns with the theme presented by the rest of the diorama.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the diorama exhibit visual elements consistent with a vintage explorer theme, such as aged textures, map etchings, and antique styling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents several visual elements consistent with a vintage explorer theme. The use of a map on the base, the glass cloche, and the antique styling of the quill and holder all contribute to this thematic representation. The aged textures and color palette further enhance the vintage feel, synonymous with explorers' equipment from past centuries.",
