      "question": "Does the edited version retain the original photo subjects (polar bear and cubs in an icy setting)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear depiction of a polar bear and two cubs situated on what appears to be an ice floe with water in the background. This matches the description of the photo subjects as polar bears in an icy setting, thus indicating that the original subjects have been retained. The visual cues showing polar bears and ice environments facilitate this analysis.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the color tone of the image been slightly cooled to include more blue and white hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment surrounding the polar bears, such as the ice and the water, predominantly features blue and white hues, characteristic of a cooler color palette. These colors are associated with cold climates and ice settings, aligning with the notion of an image adjusted to a cooler color tone. Without access to Image A for direct comparison, we deduce this from the visible elements of Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a message displayed prominently which reads “Only Ic Left. Nowhere to Go.” located under the main headline “CLIMATE CRISIS” at the top of the image. This placement and style fulfill the criteria of a bold headline integrated at the top of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows logos and text at the bottom, which includes references such as 'NOGIMCATI' and additional text that seems to mimic a website or organizational information, indicating inclusion of a logo or website text at the bottom as part of the edited presentation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a photograph of polar bears in a natural setting, combined with textual elements addressing the climate crisis, without any exaggerated or cartoonish distortions in the subjects or ice environment. The design and style imply serious communication of the real-world issue, thus maintaining a realistic style.",
