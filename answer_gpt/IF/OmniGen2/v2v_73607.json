      "question": "Is the image rendered in the style of an Ancient Egyptian painted relief?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is clearly designed to mimic the style of Ancient Egyptian painted reliefs. This can be deduced from the use of flat, bold colors, and the specific depictions of figures with traditional Egyptian motifs, such as palm trees and hieroglyphs. The visual presentation is consistent with the stylistic conventions of Ancient Egyptian art, which often included images carved or painted in a relief style on walls.",

      "question": "Does the woman appear in a formal Egyptian pose with her face in profile and eyes facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B is depicted with her body facing sideways while her eyes face the viewer, a characteristic feature of Egyptian art where figures are often in profile, but the eyes are shown as if seen from the front. This artistic convention is a hallmark of Ancient Egyptian representations, emphasizing a stylized formality.",

      "question": "Is the woman wearing a royal linen garment adorned with leopard motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is depicted in clothing with a leopard pattern, which suggests luxury and royal association in many historical contexts, including Ancient Egypt where animal patterns were sometimes used in royal or divine iconography. Given the overall Egyptian style of the scene, this interpretation aligns well with the concept of royal garments.",

      "question": "Have the golden boxing gloves been transformed into symbolic gilded offerings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the golden boxing gloves in Image B retain their shape and appearance of boxing gloves, they are portrayed within an Egyptian-themed scene. However, they are not explicitly altered to resemble traditional symbolic offerings like ankhs or other Egyptian ritual objects. Thus, they remain gloves rather than transformed offerings.",

      "question": "Are the background palm leaves stylized as sacred flora within a hieroglyph-bordered scene on a sandstone textured wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features palm trees which are consistent with the representation of sacred flora in Egyptian art due to their cultural and environmental significance. The presence of hieroglyphs alongside these elements in a sandstone-textured scene further supports this interpretation, as it reflects traditional Egyptian iconography and art style.",
