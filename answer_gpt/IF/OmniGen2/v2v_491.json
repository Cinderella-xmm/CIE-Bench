      "question": "Does the bear figure feature precise proportions and intricate fur details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear figure is depicted with exaggerated features, such as a large head and simplified textures, which are characteristic of a stylized, toy-like or animated design rather than a realistic one. The fur is rendered more uniformly and lacks the intricate, individual strand detail seen in highly realistic depictions of fur. Thus, the proportions are not precise, nor are the fur details intricate.",

      "question": "Does the bear figure have emotive eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bear in Image B features large, round eyes similar to those often found in animations or toys designed to convey expressions. This style often makes the eyes appear more emotive than realistic animal eyes, suggesting character and emotion, typical of a design approach focused on expressiveness.",

      "question": "Is the bear figure placed on a desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear figure is situated indoors, with a flat surface that appears to be a desk or table. This can be inferred from the presence of books and plants in the background, which indicates a typical office or study setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a realistic, scaled-down model of the backpack included in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a backpack next to the bear figure that appears proportionally large as compared to the bear. This suggests the backpack is not a scaled-down model but rather a full-sized object relative to the entire scene, which is stylized to suit the bear figure's exaggerated size.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the scene have a casual, natural vibe, as if captured using a smartphone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a perfected and polished look typical of studio photography or digital rendering, with controlled lighting and composition. This detracts from the spontaneous and unrefined aesthetics usually associated with casual smartphone photography. The background and setting appear designed and intentional.",

      "question": "Does the bear figure seamlessly combine lifelike textures with distinctive Japanese anime-style elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bear figure in Image B features a mix of smooth, toy-like simplified textures and enlarged expressive features like typical anime-style eyes. While it does not include lifelike textures, these anime-inspired features give it a distinct stylized look that is common in Japanese anime-inspired designs. This fusion is not seamless because it lacks realistic textures, yet it distinctly matches anime-style characteristics.",
