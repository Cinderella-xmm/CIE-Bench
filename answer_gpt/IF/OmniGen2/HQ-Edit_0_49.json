    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the teapot enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is clearly visible inside a dome-shaped glass that covers it, which can be identified by the curved reflection and refraction of light on the surface of the dome. The transparency and shape suggest that it is indeed a glass dome covering the teapot.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base on which the teapot is placed in Image B reflects both the teapot and the surrounding objects, which indicates that the surface is reflective like a mirror. This conclusion is drawn from the clear reflections visible in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small porcelain cups arranged in a circle around the base of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are four small cups visible around the teapot inside the glass dome. These cups are evenly spaced, forming a circular arrangement around the base of the teapot. The cups' positions clearly suggest a circular configuration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there additional tiny, detailed engravings visible on the elevated surfaces of the teapot, amplifying its existing patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the teapot with very intricate and detailed engravings on its surface, much like ornamental patterns typically found on antique teapots. The elevated surfaces feature detailed designs, but whether they are additional to 'existing patterns' cannot be specifically discerned just from the given image since this assessment relies on comparison with an unshown baseline pattern.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible faux steam spirals rising upward from the teapot, forming curved, wispy trails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts wispy, white spirals emanating from the top of the teapot, resembling steam trails. These are visually distinct and mimic the appearance of steam, often stylistically depicted in images to convey heat or freshly brewed beverages.",
