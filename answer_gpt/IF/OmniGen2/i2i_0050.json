      "question": "Does the edited image contain three separate frames capturing the skater's motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a singular scene featuring a horse grazing by a body of water, without any evidence of separate frames capturing motion. Thus, the image does not depict multiple frames or motion sequences.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the three frames clearly showing the push-off, ground contact, and forward lean of the skater?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B depicts a stationary scene of a horse and landscape, there are no frames showing a skater or any actions such as push-off, ground contact, or forward lean. This question's criteria do not match the content of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a realistic style with natural colors and details, including a grazing horse and a background landscape. There is no evidence of stylistic distortion, suggesting that the image retains a real-life representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visual indicators such as motion trajectory lines. The scene is static, with a horse and a scenic background devoid of any dynamic or motion-related elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a singular, cohesive scene focused on a grazing horse by the water. There are no elements resembling separate frames combined within this image, as it presents one continuous view.",
