      "question": "Does the illustration include four frames showing the stages of prepare, swing, hit, and follow-through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it is evident that there's only a uniform white background present, and no detailed observations of any frames or illustrations depicting different stages of tennis movements can be made. Considering this information, the answer is 'No'.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the illustration drawn in clean line art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B only shows a plain white image with no visible line art or illustration style. Understanding line art involves images that consist primarily of lines and outlines in a clean, stylized manner. Since there is no such visual depiction, the answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Does the illustration use monochrome color fill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A monochrome color fill implies shades of only one color. Given that Image B is completely white without any tonal variation or other hues, it doesn't qualify as monochrome color fill in the illustrative context. Hence, the answer is 'No'.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the background been completely removed from the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is entirely white with no additional elements, suggesting a complete removal of any original background elements. This implies that the answer is 'Yes'.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the 4-frame illustration arranged in a horizontal format as an instructional strip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not present any multi-frame illustration setup, nor does it exhibit a strip format. Itâ€™s simply a blank white background, indicating no such arrangement. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",
