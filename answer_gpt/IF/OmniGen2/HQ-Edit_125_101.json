    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical boundary resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct transparent spherical boundary encompassing the scene, which is characteristic of a snow globe. The material appears glass-like, and the interior view is visually consistent with how a snow globe typically encapsulates its contents.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a 3D ballerina figure inside the snow globe that replicates the leaping pose of the original dancer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a figure inside the globe mimicking the pose of the original dancer. The figure's position, attire, and leap are consistent with the dancer's dynamic movement and posture from Image A, suggesting it is a 3D representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the Eiffel Tower and at least two other recognizable miniature Parisian landmarks present inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B's globe, the Eiffel Tower is prominently visible, accompanied by two smaller towers. Although these are not clearly identified as distinct Parisian landmarks, their style is suggestive of such, as often replicated in miniature forms within snow globes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible swirling snowflakes surrounding the Eiffel Tower and other landmarks inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the globe contains spots of white material resembling snowflakes distributed inside the spherical boundary. The placement and appearance suggest swirling, reminiscent of how snowflakes typically behave inside a snow globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the snow globe in Image B appears to be metallic, likely bronze, given its coloration and sheen, complemented by a glass-like structure. There are visible engravings on the base, and the script appears to be in French style.",
