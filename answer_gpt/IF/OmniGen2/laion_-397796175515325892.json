      "question": "Has the church been rendered in a semi-cartoon style with simplified shapes and stylized lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church displays simplified shapes and stylized lines characteristic of a semi-cartoon style. This style often involves basic geometric forms, clear outlines, and vibrant colors, which are evident here. The artistic representation abstracts and exaggerates certain features, lending a playful and accessible aesthetic typical of cartoon renditions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the architectural elements of the church perfectly symmetrical on both sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B independently, it is clear that the church design is symmetrical. The tower and architectural details are mirrored on either side of the central axis, which is common in idealized renditions aiming for harmony and balance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible metallic gold accents applied specifically to the spires and upper parts of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual inspection doesn't show any specific metallic gold accents applied separately to the spires and upper sections of the church. Instead, the entire rendering adopts a cohesive color palette that doesn't distinguishes explicit metallic accents.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the proportion of the church been altered to enhance its sense of grandeur and scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the church in a manner that retains realistic proportions without exaggerating its structure for added grandeur or scale. The semi-cartoon style may simplify the architectural features but does not necessarily alter its proportions for enhanced grandeur.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the background been replaced with a celestial-themed design featuring elements like stars, galaxies, or cosmic hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background with a bright blue sky, clouds, and a sun, not star, galaxies, or cosmic hues. Such elements give a cheerful and simple outdoor setting rather than a celestial-themed design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there three separate architectural art prints displayed, each within a matte black frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows four different instances of the church illustration, each within its own matte black frame. Thus, it depicts four prints and not three, as the question suggests.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the three prints arranged in a trifold album format, with a central fold and two outer panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setup is not in a trifold album format as it displays four framed prints arranged in a grid pattern, not suggesting any central fold or structured album layout.",
      "weight": 1,
