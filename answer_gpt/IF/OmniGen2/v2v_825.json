      "question": "Are the calendar pages arranged into a tidy pile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar pages are scattered unevenly over the surface. They overlap and are angled differently, not stacked in a neat or tidy arrangement. The lack of alignment or stacking of the pages suggests a disorganized or random placement rather than a neat pile.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the handwritten notes and highlighted dates still present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the prominent handwritten notes like 'Birthday', 'No Work', 'Wedding', and 'Gym' are visible, and the highlighted dates with colored circles are still present. However, upon closer inspection, the note 'Quite day' in April has a typographical error, becoming 'Quct day', suggesting some change.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the calendar pages and desk surface display convincing textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar pages have a defined edge and some shadowing that suggest a paper-like texture. The wood surface of the desk also shows a natural grain and color variation that give it a realistic appearance. These visual cues suggest a convincing portrayal of textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there evidence of lighting and shadow depth creating a realistic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are shadows underneath the calendar pages where they overlap, and the lighting appears consistent across the scene. These shadows and lighting effects contribute to a sense of depth and realism, suggesting careful attention to creating a realistic visual effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the colors and styles of the handwritten notes and highlighted dates been preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handwritten notes and highlighted dates use similar colors and lettering styles as seen in the first image. However, the typographical error in the note for April indicates a change, though the overall color and style remain consistent otherwise. This both suggests preservation and a small alteration.",
