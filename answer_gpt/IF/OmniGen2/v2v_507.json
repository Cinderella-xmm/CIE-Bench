      "question": "Does the chibi tech mascot incorporate the phone's original design elements and color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the tech mascot incorporates the phone's design elements and color scheme, I first observe the color palette and design features of the phone in Image A. The phone has a distinct pinkish hue. In Image B, the tech mascot is set against a similar pinkish background, and the items displayed, such as a hoodie and a phone, incorporate this color scheme. This suggests that there is a coherent design element from the phone in Image A to the tech mascot in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the chibi tech mascot has short, proportionally smaller legs compared to its body, which is a common feature in chibi art styles. This indicates that the legs are not elongated but rather fit the proportions typical of chibi design.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
