      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the octopus replaced by a series of curved ceramic sculptures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects appear to be stylized blue sculptures resembling octopuses with a glossy finish. Analyzing their structure and material appearance, they lack the organic complexity of a real octopus and instead have a ceramic-like quality. Therefore, these are indeed ceramic sculptures replacing the natural octopus form.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the sculptures exhibit a glossy, reflective surface consistent with glazed ceramic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculptures in Image B have a shiny, reflective surface that is typical of glazed ceramic. This glossy finish is a stark contrast from the matte, textured skin of a real octopus. The light reflecting off the surface and the smoothness indicate a glaze, confirming they are ceramic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sculptures colored in deep oceanic blue tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color of the sculptures in Image B is a rich, deep blue, akin to ocean colors. It's a departure from the natural browns and reds typically seen in real octopuses, supporting the use of an artistic, monochromatic choice for these sculptures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sculptures feature textured scales that resemble the original octopus skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculptures in Image B have a smooth surface without the natural textured look of octopus skin, which often features a more irregular, tactile surface due to tentacle suckers and skin texture. The lack of this texturing suggests they do not have scales resembling the original octopus skin.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a smooth, sandy-colored surface without natural textures or features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is a smooth, uniform sandy color which lacks any natural textures or features such as foliage or water seen in Image A. This setting further emphasizes the artificial, controlled artistic presentation of the sculptures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the sculptures arranged in a harmonious wave pattern that reflects the motion of ocean waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of the sculptures in Image B does not distinctly resemble a wave pattern that mimics the motion of ocean waves. Instead, they appear to be casually placed within the scene. The absence of a clear flowing pattern that mirrors ocean wave motion suggests a more static arrangement.",
