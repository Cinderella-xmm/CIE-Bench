    "Question": "Q1: Has the painting on the wall been removed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wall no longer features a painting, as Image A does. Instead, Image B shows a screen mounted on the wall. This indicates that the original painting has likely been removed to make space for the screen. The absence of the artwork in Image B is a clear visual cue.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Has a digital display screen been added in place of the painting?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a large rectangular object on the wall, which resembles a digital screen showing a scene with vibrant colors and high resolution. This is distinct from traditional artwork, suggesting that a digital screen has been added where the painting was in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the digital display screen show real-time weather imagery?",
    "explanation": "The screen in Image B displays a serene landscape with a large sun, mountains, and palm trees. Although it resembles picturesque landscapes, it doesn't contain indicators such as weather forecasts or data typically associated with real-time weather imagery. Hence, it's more likely an artistic representation or visualization rather than a real-time weather display.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the digital display screen positioned in the same location as the original painting?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the painting is centrally positioned on the wall above the two chairs. In Image B, the digital display screen occupies the same central location on the wall. The consistent placement of the main wall feature in both images suggests that the screen is positioned where the painting originally was.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the overall composition and balance of the room been maintained after replacing the painting with the digital display screen?",
    "explanation": "Both images show a similar arrangement of two chairs beneath the wall-mounted feature (painting in Image A and screen in Image B). The screen appears to be of similar size to the painting, maintaining visual balance and symmetry between the chairs and the wall-mounted feature. Thus, the room's composition remains well-balanced after the change.",
    "answer": "Yes"
