    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the stack of tires reshaped into a creature resembling an armadillo with a segmented, armored back made from the tire treads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is designed to resemble a creature with a shape that could be interpreted as an armadillo. The creature has a segmented, armored-like back, which suggests the utilization of the tire tread patterns even though there is no direct visual evidence of these specific treads. However, the overall visual impression, especially the design choice to resemble an armadillo, fits the description even if treads are not explicitly mentioned.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible metallic joints located within the openings between the tires, suggesting mechanical articulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a structure that does not have obvious visible openings with metallic joints within the creature that indicate mechanical articulation. The design seems more streamlined without exposed metallic joints, focusing rather on a fantasy or futuristic theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the central wheel hubs been replaced with glowing mechanical eyes that emit light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central wheel hub of what might be the creature's 'face' has a glowing element that resembles a mechanical eye. This gives the impression of a light-emitting ocular feature rather than a standard wheel hub, which aligns with the description provided.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there antennae-like structures extending from the top of the creature, featuring electric blue accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows structures that rise from the back of the creature, resembling antennae, which have distinctly electric blue accents. This visual cue matches the description of antennae-like structures extending from the top.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature feature steampunk-style elements such as gears, rivets, or brass-colored metalwork, giving it a mechanical guardian appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B, while mechanical, does not prominently draw from steampunk aesthetics like exposed gears, extensive use of rivets, or brass-colored metal typically associated with steampunk. It instead focuses on a smooth, modern design with futuristic elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the original tire tread patterns still visible and used as part of the creatureâ€™s armored exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image incorporates a smooth, more futuristic design that does not explicitly showcase the original tire tread patterns as part of its armored exterior. The design elements are more abstract and do not retain identifiable tire treads from Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the creature have a posture or design indicating it is capable of movement, such as being balanced on wheels or having rolling components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts the creature with wheels, implying mobility. The presence of wheels and a balanced stance suggests the ability for movement, much like a toy or a robot designed to roll.",
