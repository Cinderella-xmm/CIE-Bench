      "question": "Have the couple's backs been designed as a crystal silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the couple's backs feature geometric shapes that resemble crystals. These are visually distinct from typical human silhouettes and indicate some level of artistic alteration, resembling crystal forms due to their geometric and faceted characteristics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the integration of crystal designs alters the natural silhouette of the couple’s backs as they do not follow the organic curves of the human form. These geometric shapes adds an artistic twist, deviating from the original outlines in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited couple's backs in Image B appear to have reflective and transparent qualities due to the crystal-like design. This design choice suggests surfaces that could refract light or appear translucent, based on the visual cues of their faceted shapes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the environment's elements such as the bench, tree, and grass from Image A, without evident alterations. The focus change seems centered solely on the couple's backs, ensuring other environmental aspects remain consistent.",
