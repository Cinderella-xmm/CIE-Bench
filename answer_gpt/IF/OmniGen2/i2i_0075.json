      "question": "Does the edited image combine the front and right-side views of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is shown in a front-facing position with symmetry, demonstrating that both images depict the cat from the same perspective. There is no indication of a right-side view being integrated; both cats present a forward-facing view, maintaining a symmetrical appearance, which aligns with a common expectation for presenting a subject in a straightforward manner.",

      "question": "Are the cat's facial features clearly visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat with clear and distinct facial features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. This is evident from the symmetrical alignment and even proportions, which are typical traits when rendering an animal's face clearly. The high level of detail and the absence of any visual obstructions ensure the features are visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cat's body structure properly showcased in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's body structure is depicted with a focus on the frontal view, illustrating its chest and front paws. However, important elements such as the body depth, limbs, and posture are less detailed, focusing primarily on symmetry rather than providing a complete anatomical rendition. This depiction reflects a stylized representation, not a comprehensive showcase.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the original color, size, and position of the cat been preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a clean and consistent color palette, with a white cat having subtle creamy tones similar to the typical color descriptions. Although both cats in Image B are similar in size and positioned centrally, they are stylized compared to a more naturalistic approach. This suggests some artistic adjustment in their portrayal, possibly deviating in detail from any original reference.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition free from distortion and inconsistency in integrating both views of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not attempt to integrate different views; both cats are positioned to show the front view distinctly, and no merging of perspectives is present. Thus, there are no issues of distortion or inconsistency because the views are not combined, ensuring coherence in how the cat is pictured symmetrically twice.",
