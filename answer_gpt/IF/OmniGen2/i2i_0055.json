      "question": "Has the baby elephant been transformed into a cartoon character while keeping the original pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon version of a baby elephant. The cartoon character retains elements like the yellow safety helmet and orange clothing, which resembles the original look of the construction worker outfit present in Image A. The character appears to maintain a similar stance with arms at its sides, akin to the standing pose of the worker, aligning with a conversion from the original image to a cartoon representation.",

      "question": "Does the cartoon baby elephant exhibit a rounded and cute style with smooth edges and soft features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon elephant in Image B has smooth, rounded features typical of a cute, stylized design. The soft edges of the elephant's body, face, and clothing suggest an intentional design meant to appear friendly and approachable for a wide audience, typical in cartoon illustrations.",

      "question": "Are the texts “First Splash!” and “Ele-Baby” included in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text ‘First Splash!’ is visibly displayed at the top right corner, but there is no text “Ele-Baby” included anywhere in the image. This presence and absence of text is directly visible by inspecting the image content.",

      "question": "Is the text “First Splash!” and “Ele-Baby” placed on a transparent background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'First Splash!' is placed on what appears to be a transparent or checkered background, which is indicative of transparency in digital images. However, since 'Ele-Baby' is not present, the answer reflects the positioning of only the visible text.",

      "question": "Is the pose of the cartoon baby elephant identical to the original baby elephant's pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the cartoon baby elephant in Image B stands similarly with its arms at the sides as seen in the construction worker pose in Image A, the overall stance doesn't exhibit a one-to-one match due to differences in artistic representation. Thus, the poses are similar but not identical due to the stylistic adjustments made for the cartoon version.",
