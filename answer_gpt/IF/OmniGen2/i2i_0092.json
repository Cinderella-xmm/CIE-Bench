        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible objects include a cup of coffee on a table, chairs, and a seaside café setting. There is no phone or stand visible in the image, indicating their complete removal. The analysis involved recognizing and identifying the objects present in the image, which are entirely different from those initially present in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a table with a cup and saucer set against a backdrop of sand and ocean waves, suggesting a seaside setting. The analysis utilized visual cues such as the beach and ocean view visible in the background, commonly associated with seaside cafés.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, sunlight visibly illuminates the scene, creating reflections on the ocean that are visible in the background. This evidence, combined with the understanding of how light interacts with reflective surfaces, suggests that there would be reflections of the bright sunlight and ocean waves likely on the tabletop. The analysis reasoned through the presence of direct light sources and their potential reflective effects.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes tables, chairs, and a cup of coffee with a saucer, all commonly associated with café settings. The presence of the beach and ocean further establishes the ambiance of a seaside café. The analysis involved identifying typical café items and elements, combined with the background setting to establish a seaside café atmosphere.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The perspective in Image B is consistent with a tabletop view, focusing on the cup of coffee and the surrounding scene from a realistic angle, providing depth and proportion congruent with real-world settings. The analysis reviewed the alignment and scale of objects, supporting a natural and realistic composition within the seaside setting.",
