      "question": "Is the overall image rendered in a stylized, illustrative manner consistent with 1920s Art Deco fashion illustrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) features bold lines, high contrast, and a limited color palette that is reminiscent of Art Deco illustrations from the 1920s. This style is characterized by its geometric forms, strong linearity, and a sophisticated aesthetic. The use of a limited color scheme with a contrasting background further aligns with the graphic style of the period.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dress feature a flapper-style silhouette with geometric patterns and fringe along the hem or edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the dress is depicted in black, which is consistent with flapper styles in terms of the color commonly associated with the period. However, there are no visible geometric patterns or fringe along the hem in the way that would typify a 1920s flapper dress.",

      "question": "Has the bag been replaced with a beaded clutch featuring detailed beadwork and a design consistent with 1920s fashion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bag in the edited image (Image B) retains its leopard print design from the original image (Image A) and does not appear to be replaced by a beaded clutch. The design, although stylized, does not reflect the detailed beadwork typically associated with 1920s fashion.",

      "question": "Are the shoes now T-strap style with a refined, vintage design suitable for the 1920s?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the shoes remain as platform heels, which do not align with the T-strap style commonly worn during the 1920s. The large, open-toed platform design does not have the refined, vintage appearance of 1920s footwear.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) background features strong linear geometric patterns in gold and black, which are characteristic of Art Deco design. These elements are classic features used in Art Deco to create visually striking and modern compositions, fitting the description given.",
