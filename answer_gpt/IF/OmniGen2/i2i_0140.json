      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the image display a soft hand-painted texture characteristic of watercolor illustrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's an evident soft and fluid feel to the colors and textures, which is typical of watercolor illustrations. The colors appear to blend subtly, and there is a lack of sharpness that is characteristic of watercolor paintings. This visual softness and fluidity suggest the use of a watercolor style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bedding patterns from the original image preserved in the watercolor illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, Image A features quilt patterns with distinct stenciled designs. In Image B, these patterns are still maintained, though they are depicted in a less sharp and more fluid watercolor style. The shapes and color placements of the original pattern are visible in the edited illustration, indicating preservation of the original design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the colors in the image exhibit a soft blending typical of watercolor paintings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors show a gentle transition and blending, especially at the edges of objects and bedding. This characteristic soft blending, which avoids harsh lines and allows for gradient transitions, is typical of watercolor paintings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible brush stroke textures or subtle variations in shading throughout the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, one can observe subtle shading variations and an impression of brush strokes to some extent. These contribute to creating depth and an organic look, consistent with a watercolor painting style, where not all areas are uniformly colored.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Can detailed designs in the bedding, like the star patterns, still be clearly seen after conversion to the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B uses a watercolor effect, the essential star patterns on the bedding are still distinguishable. While the watercolor style reduces detail clarity, the framework and color distribution that defines the star patterns are preserved, allowing them to be recognized.",
