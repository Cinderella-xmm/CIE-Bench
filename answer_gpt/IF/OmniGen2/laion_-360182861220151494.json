        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is clearly divided into three sections with borders separating each part, which is common for manga pages. These divisions resemble panels used in comic or manga layouts. The distinct arrangement supports this conclusion.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does Panel 1 show a close-up of the girl's intense eyes and her hand gripping the katana?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 1 of Image B depicts the girl with a sword, but it does not feature a close-up of her eyes or her hand gripping the katana; instead, it shows the full figure of the girl holding the katana.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text box in Panel 1 of Image B contains the text: 'I will rise beyond the phoczey brusax braze!', which is different from 'I will rise beyond the phoenix blaze.' Hence, it does not match the exact sentence.",
      "weight": 1,

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 of Image B shows the girl, but she is not depicted as leaping forward with fiery trails. Instead, the depiction involves a stylistic representation with a background theme, lacking the specific details of fiery trails emanating from her hair or a smirk.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble in Panel 2 of Image B does not contain the exact text 'No challenge too fierce!'. Instead, it reads 'Witnes to Gloor!' and does not match the specified sentence.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 3 in Image B contains a speech bubble with the text 'No challenge my true power!', which differs from 'Witness my true power!', thus the sentence is not present as specified.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The aspect ratio of 3:4 refers to a specific proportion width to height. The panels in Image B do not precisely adhere to this exact aspect ratio, as they share an irregular sizing common to graphical compositions rather than having a fixed ratio.",
