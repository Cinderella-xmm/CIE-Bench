      "question": "Has the teapot been transformed into a candle design, with the overall object now resembling a candle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object clearly resembles a candle, with a flame emerging from the top, a cylindrical shape typical of candles, and glass material that encases the wax. This is in contrast to Image A, which depicts a highly ornate teapot with a spout and handle, indicating a transformation from a teapot into a candle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the body of the object now rendered with a transparent or translucent glass-like finish consistent with a candle base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the object as having a glass-like finish, which is typical for a candle holder. The transparent glass allows the light of the flame to give a warm glow through the wax, which is indicative of a candle. This is different from the teapot in Image A, which is opaque and metallic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the surface of the object exhibit a high-gloss ceramic finish instead of a metallic one?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the object is not ceramic but rather glass, which suits a candle design, providing transparency and shine. Image A, featuring the original teapot, has a metallic finish, so there is no indication of a ceramic finish in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the spout been replaced with a visible wick extending from the top of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wick extending from the center top of the object, which is lit like a candle flame. This wick is characteristic of a candle and replaces the spout visible in Image A, confirming this transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the handle been transformed into a decorative gold accent rather than retaining its original functional form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible handle like that in Image A. Instead, it is a cylindrical candle with no handles, and hence there is no transformation of a handle into a decorative gold accent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a subtle floral pattern visible around the base of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a subtle floral pattern visible around the base of the candle, which enhances its decorative aesthetics. This is different from Image A, where the teapot has intricate metallic designs but no distinctive floral pattern at the base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the text \"Eternal Elegance Candle\" written in elegant script on the front of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the text 'Eternal Elegance Candle' prominently displayed in elegant script on the front of the candle, which is consistent with the design and branding of a candle product. This text does not appear on Image A, which has no such branding.",
