      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe of the elderly man is analyzed focusing on its design and pattern. It has vertical stripes with intricate detailing as seen in the lower half of the robe, which may give an impression of geometric patterning. However, these patterns appear consistent with traditional designs rather than being described as 'vibrant, exaggerated geometric patterns'. Comparing this to Image A, the robe maintains a similar design, suggesting there's no significant alteration to vibrant or exaggerated geometric patterns.",
