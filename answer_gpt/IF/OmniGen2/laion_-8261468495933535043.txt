    "explanation": "In Image B, an examination reveals larger tiles used for representing the sausage shapes compared to the finer, more detailed tiles representing the lettuce. This visual distinction corresponds with the practice of using larger tiles for more uniform shapes and sizes in art composition, confirming the sausages' tiles are noticeably larger than those used for the lettuce.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the mosaic composition arranged symmetrically on a plain ceramic background?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a mosaic arrangement that, upon inspection, does not appear symmetric. The visual layout exhibits asymmetry in tile sizes and positioning of elements, typical of artistic mosaics which often embrace dynamism rather than strict symmetry. Considering the background, it appears plain and ceramic, serving as a neutral canvas for the mosaic design. Thus, while the background is plain ceramic, the mosaic composition itself is not arranged symmetrically.",
    "answer": "No"
