      "question": "Is the badge in the edited image circular?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge is clearly circular in shape. This is evident from its uniform round edge and the symmetrical appearance, which denotes a circular form. This conclusion is based on the distinct visual information provided in the edited image, where the circular perimeter is defined clearly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a badge that contains distinct and recognizable landmarks: the Statue of Liberty, the Eiffel Tower, and the London Eye. These features are visible and identifiable due to the clear portrayal and arrangement of these iconic structures on the badge. This conclusion is drawn from the discernible outlines and identifiable characteristics of these well-known landmarks, which are depicted in the badge's imagery.",

      "question": "Are tassels included as part of the badge design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are apparent tassels attached to the badge design. These are represented with colored threads tied to the badge, which suggests the inclusion of tassels. This visual detail is interpreted based on the presence of two tassel-like features appended on either side of the badge.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a hand is noticeably holding the badge, positioned prominently in the foreground. This is concluded from the visual element of a human hand clasping the circular badge, which is a clear focus of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B features vibrant colors, typical of anime design, it does not showcase the typical detailed line work and stylized characteristics of anime-inspired artwork. The badge features a lifelike representation of the landmarks rather than anime stylization. This can be deduced from the clean, realistic depiction without exaggerated anime-style features.",
