        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is distinctly visible under a transparent glass dome. The dome surrounds the entire teapot, which is a typical decorative method to display precious items. The glass is clear, allowing us to see the entire teapot clearly through it. This common design is used to protect and showcase the object underneath, which aligns with world knowledge about displaying collectible or ornate items.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is clearly displayed on a wooden base that has a vintage design. The base supports a layer that looks soft and velvet-like, which is often used to enhance the presentation of displayed objects while protecting the base and what's on it. This combination of materials and design is commonly associated with classic presentation styles, confirming the presence of a vintage-style wooden base and soft velvet lining.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is adorned with tiny flowering plants and ferns, but they are positioned around and inside the glass dome, not specifically shown growing from the spout and lid of the teapot. The plants and ferns provide a decorative backdrop within the glass dome but are not integrated into the structure of the teapot itself.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several small butterflies are clearly visible within the glass dome, and they appear to hover near the teapot. The butterflies serve as decorative elements, adding a lively touch to the overall presentation. They are not directly interacting with the teapot's engravings but are placed close enough to be visually associated with it.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image use primarily subtle earth-toned colors (e.g., browns, greens, soft grays) throughout the scene, avoiding bright or metallic highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color scheme is indeed centered around subtle earth tones. The wood of the base, the greens of the plants, and the neutral tones of the teapot contribute to a soft, cohesive palette. Bright or metallic highlights that would stand out are notably absent, emphasizing a subtle and harmonious aesthetic.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot maintains its ornate floral engravings and decorative details. These elements are preserved and remain the focal point of the teapot's design, showcasing intricate craftsmanship even when placed under the glass dome. The engravings are clear and distinct, consistent with their intended ornamental purpose.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome is designed to fully enclose the teapot, wooden base, plants, and butterflies. It creates an encased environment typical of display domes, with no visible openings to allow external elements to enter.
