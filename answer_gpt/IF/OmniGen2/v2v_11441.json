      "question": "Is the ground covered in snow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground is depicted as a white surface, which is typically indicative of snow. The visual appearance of snow and the presence of snowflakes strongly suggest a winter setting. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the ground is indeed covered in snow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there snowflakes falling in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features several white, star-like shapes in the air around the radish character and the dog. These shapes are commonly designed to represent snowflakes in artwork, indicating that snowflakes are falling in the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the radish character have a scarf and hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the radish character is visibly wearing a brown scarf around its neck, which is appropriate for a winter setting. However, there is no hat visible on the radish character; therefore, we conclude that the character has a scarf but not a hat.",

      "question": "Is the dog wearing a winter jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is clearly depicted wearing a green coat, which resembles a winter jacket. This type of clothing is typically used to keep warm in colder conditions, and thus it is reasonable to conclude that the dog is wearing a winter jacket.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the scene overall appear to be a winter landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B features several winter-specific elements: the ground is covered in snow, snowflakes are falling, and the characters are wearing winter clothing suitable for cold weather. Additionally, the background includes snow-covered trees. These visual cues collectively suggest that the scene is designed to represent a winter landscape.",
