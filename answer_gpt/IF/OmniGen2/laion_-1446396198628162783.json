      "question": "Is the title \"Journey to Space\" clearly displayed in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the top, the text 'Journey Trainy to Space' appears prominently. This indicates the title is displayed, although there is a typographical error with 'Trainy' instead of 'Training.' However, the presence of the title suggests it's supposed to convey the theme of space journey.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the astronaut figure still present and positioned centrally in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, clearly shows an astronaut figure placed centrally. This astronaut is a graphic illustration, different from the figure in Image A, which appears to be a real-life astronaut in a suit. However, the central positioning is consistent in Image B.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the background been transformed into a mission control center with elements like control panels, screens, or consoles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a clean and simplified background that is graphic-oriented without detailed elements like control panels, screens, or consoles commonly found in a mission control center. The background is minimal with colored sections for infographic purposes, indicating no transformation into a mission control center.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there four distinct illustrative icons present, each representing one of the following: Physical Training, Technical Skills, Simulators, and Space Suit Check?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed four distinct illustrative icons surrounding the central astronaut figure. These icons are labeled and correspond to 'Physicaing,' 'Techninning,' 'Simuatiors,' and 'Space Check.' Each icon visually represents its respective stage despite some misspellings in the labels.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the four training stages represented in distinct, vibrant color-coded sections (e.g., different colored backgrounds or labels)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each training stage in Image B is enclosed within a circular icon, and these icons are color-coded with vibrant colors such as orange, blue, yellow, and light blue. This use of color clearly differentiates each section, emphasizing the distinctness of each stage.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the text describing each training stage written in clean, modern typography (e.g., sans-serif font, consistent style)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the typography appears to be in a sans-serif style, which is generally considered to be clean and modern. However, the text is not entirely clean due to typographic errors, which affects the perception of consistency despite the typeface style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the overall design appear cohesive and informative, with a logical flow connecting the astronaut to the training stages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design in Image B visually connects the astronaut to the surrounding training stages, suggesting a logical flow. The arrangement of elements and the use of color coding help to maintain a cohesive look, even if there are some issues with text accuracy. These elements work together to make the design informative.",
