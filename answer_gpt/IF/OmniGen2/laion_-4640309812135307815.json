      "question": "Has the dress been transformed into a translucent red-tinted glass flacon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object presented is clearly a glass flacon, characterized by its translucent red-tinted glass. In contrast, a dress is typically made of fabric, not glass. Image A displays a dress composed of sheer material with red floral appliqu√©. The flacon in Image B possesses the qualities of a perfume bottle rather than a dress, so the dress from Image A has indeed been transformed into this flacon in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flacon showcases petal motifs on its surface, which are visually similar to petals placed on the fabric of the dress in Image A. These motifs contribute to the ornamental design of the bottle and create a sense of continuity from Image A to Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the bottle have an elegant cap resembling a stylized red flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap of the flacon in Image B is designed to resemble a stylized red flower with layered petals, enhancing the overall floral theme. This feature aligns with the red floral details found on the dress in Image A, thus maintaining thematic continuity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A metallic label with a cursive brand signature is clearly visible on the front of the flacon in Image B. This label adds a luxurious touch to the bottle, which is typically not found on clothing like the dress in Image A. This transformation suggests a branding detail added in the design of the flacon.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flacon in Image B maintains a sleek and somewhat elongated shape that could be seen as mirroring the silhouette of the dress worn in Image A. Both the dress and the flacon have a vertical orientation with a similar sense of elegance and flow, making the flacon appear to echo the dress's form.",
