    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image feature a horse in the original pose as the protagonist?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is a man riding a horse. The horse is prominently featured as part of a movie poster design, which suggests it plays a significant role. The posture of the horse is standing with a rider, which is often used in promotional imagery to signify prominence or protagonism. This contrasts with Image A, where there is no horse, only a cat and a remote control. Thus, the edited image features a horse as the protagonist.",
