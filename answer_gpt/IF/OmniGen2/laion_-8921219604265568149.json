      "question": "Is the cathedral and surrounding square depicted at a significantly reduced scale, consistent with a miniature model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral and the surrounding square appear as much smaller versions of a typical full-sized scene, which is consistent with how miniatures are portrayed. This can be inferred from the presence of tiny, detailed figures and the way the structure fits neatly into a contained area within a case. These elements are all common in miniature models.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within an ornate, decorative frame featuring baroque-style architectural details such as scrolls, columns, or intricate carvings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cathedral scene enclosed within a display case, but the frame itself is not ornate with baroque-style details. It is more simplistic and focuses on framing the miniature inside without incorporating classic architectural features typical of baroque design.",

    },
    {

      "question": "Are there small-scale human figures present in the square, wearing detailed historical or formal attire, and positioned as if walking or strolling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are indeed small-scale human figures within the square of Image B. They appear to be wearing what can be identified as historical or formal clothing, which is evident from their distinct, old-fashioned designs, suggesting the clothing style typical of the era associated with the cathedral. The figures are positioned such that they seem to be engaged in activities like walking or strolling.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The façade of the cathedral in Image B has a consistent warm beige color typically seen in crafted models made from synthetic materials like resin, which give a uniform appearance and lack the natural stone texture present in real structures.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows what appears to be small lamps on either side of the scene, emitting a warm glow. This glow gives a soft and dim ambiance, which aligns with the characteristics of vintage or antique lighting typically used to create a specific mood.",
