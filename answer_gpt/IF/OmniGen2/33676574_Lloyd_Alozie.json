      "question": "Do the skyscrapers appear as integrated, articulated robotic limbs forming a larger guardian-like figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several skyscrapers are illuminated with blue neon lights, which give them a futuristic and stylized appearance. The blue lines highlight certain architectural features that resemble circuits or mechanical parts. Despite this appearance, the buildings themselves maintain a traditional skyscraper form when observed closely. They do not form any articulated limbs or a coherent larger figure reminiscent of a guardian. Therefore, while they are styled in a way that enhances their visual appeal and modernity, they do not create the impression of being robotic limbs forming a guardian-like figure.",

      "question": "Are there visible neon circuitry patterns running along the facades of the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows skyscrapers with neon lighting accentuating parts of their structure. One building, in particular, has vertical blue lines that stand out, creating a futuristic pattern. This is reminiscent of electronic circuitry due to the linear arrangement and glowing effect, which is often associated with technology and modern aesthetics. These neon lines do resemble circuitry patterns running along the building facades, enhancing their futuristic look.",

      "question": "Do the building facades feature reflective, scale-like panels arranged in an overlapping or segmented pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building facades are not prominently displaying reflective, scale-like panels arranged in an overlapping or segmented manner. The image primarily showcases lighting effects such as neon outlines and glowing patterns which draw attention to the architecture, but these do not resemble scale-like panels. Typical scale-like panels would appear as overlapping shingles or tiles, which are not evident here.",

      "question": "Are the expressways depicted as glowing, curving, spine-like structures emitting light and winding through the city?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the expressways visible in the foreground are enhanced with lighting effects that emphasize their curves and direction. They feature glowing traces that can be interpreted as light trails, often seen in night photography to indicate movement. This depiction, along with the curving nature of the roads, does suggest a spine-like appearance, as the paths and illuminated trails wind through the city in a visually striking manner.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tops of the buildings feature enhanced, fin-like vertical structures that resemble mechanical protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tops of buildings adorned with enhanced lighting. The lighting highlights vertical structures on some skyscrapers. These illuminated portions accentuate the architectural designs without fundamentally altering the structural shape to resemble fin-like, mechanical protrusions. Instead, they maintain typical skyscraper elements that are illuminated rather than resembling mechanical or fin-like extensions.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there rotating holographic elements positioned across the skyline that resemble pulsing, eye-like forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B has neon lighting effects, there are no holographic elements prominently displayed across the skyline. The lighting does illuminate certain architectural features and outlines but does not display rotating or dynamic holographic effects. Thus, there are no elements resembling pulsing, eye-like forms throughout the skyline.",
