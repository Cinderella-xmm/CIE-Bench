        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is lying open on a wooden surface, and the pages within the book's boundaries are clearly visible. There are no visual indications of pages extending beyond the edges of the frame or the book itself. The book ends within the visible area in the image and does not stretch out of the frame. This conclusion is drawn from observing the boundaries of the book within the photo frame.",

      "question": "Is there a subtle curved shadow on the extended pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the pages of the book with shadows cast likely due to ambient light and the curvature of an open book. The shadow seen is typical of book pages being turned, giving them a slight curve. However, without any pages visibly extending beyond the frame, the existing shadows are within the limits of the book itself. Hence, shadows fall on the original pages, not on any extended pages.",

      "question": "Does the editing convey the impression that the book is unfolding toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an open book with pages facing the viewer, capturing the essence of a book opening up. The angle at which the book is photographed accentuates the spread of the pages, suggesting a slight unfolding or opening motion. This impression is strengthened by how the book is arranged â€” flat on the table with pages visibly open. The perspective creates the effect of the book being actively open and inviting.",

      "question": "Are the extended pages visually consistent with the original book pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the pages are all contained within the book, without any extensions added externally. The consistency in terms of texture, color, and alignment supports uniformity among the pages. Since extension is not applicable here, all pages are original, keeping them consistent naturally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a seamless transition between the original and extended parts of the book pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes  \n```",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, it becomes apparent that the book consists solely of original pages, thus nullifying any transition between them and any non-existent extended parts. The pages observed demonstrate a continuous flow as they belong inherently to the book's framework, making transitions inapplicable.",
