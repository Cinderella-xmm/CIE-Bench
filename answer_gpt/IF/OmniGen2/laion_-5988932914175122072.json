      "question": "Has the black handbag been transformed into a human-like female model with a defined body, posture, and facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it is clear that the handbag is not transformed into a human-like female model. The handbag's structure, design, and placement dominate the foreground without any modification to resemble a human model. Therefore, visual cues strongly suggest that the handbag remains unchanged without any transformation into a model.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the model wear a black dress that replicates the pebbled leather texture and curved silhouette of the original handbag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a model wearing a dress; instead, it continues to display the handbag. The pebbled leather texture associated with the handbag is present but not mirrored in a dress worn by a model. Thus, there is no indication of a replication of handbag properties into a dress format.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the model wearing gold jewelry (e.g., earrings, necklace, bracelet) that matches the gold hardware of the original handbag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no representation of a model wearing jewelry. The handbag remains the focal object, with gold hardware features such as the MK logo but no evidence or visual cues showing that these elements are transformed into jewelry worn by a model.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The MK logo in Image B remains attached to the handbag as a circular gold charm. There is no presence of a model wearing a dress or jacket to attach this logo as a brooch. The handbag is unchanged, with its logo staying in its original format.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly has the text 'Strut the City Streets' prominently displayed at the top. The font style appears serif, contributing to a stylish presentation fitting a fashion context. The text is significant and perceptible, ensuring its visibility.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does present a runway setting as the background, indicating a fashion-themed atmosphere based on the runway characteristics. There are seated individuals, however, there is no clear evidence or distinct portrayal of a photographer actively holding a camera visible in the image.",

      "question": "Is the image formatted in a tall, narrow aspect ratio (height much greater than width)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the format of the image presents a square-like aspect ratio rather than a distinctly tall, narrow one. The dimensions of the image do not predominantly favor a height much greater than its width, defining it as relatively proportionate.",
