      "question": "Does the packaging resemble a Funko Pop figure box in design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows packaging that has a rectangular box shape with a cartoon-like character displayed prominently on the front, similar to a Funko Pop box design. The character is drawn in a stylized, chibi fashion typical of Pop figures, suggesting a similar branding aesthetic. My analysis is based on the packaging design features and common knowledge of Funko Pop boxes which often showcase stylized characters in a playful manner.",

      "question": "Is the text \"HEALING ESSENTIALS\" visible on the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'HEALING ESSENTIALS' is prominently displayed across the top of the box, using bright yellow letters on a blue background which makes it easily noticeable. My conclusion is drawn from the visible text on the box and general knowledge about packaging design where brand or product names are often made to stand out for identification.",

      "question": "Is the packaging illustrated from an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the box in a straightforward front-facing view rather than tilting or skewing the angles typically found in isometric designs. Isometric perspectives would showcase the top and side views at the same time by using a 3D angle, which is absent here. My reasoning is based on the spatial presentation of the box related to common practices in illustrative perspectives.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bandage inside the packaging have a chibi-style representation with oversized stitching and a cartoonish adhesive area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the packaging and the exterior bandage, but does not provide a visual of the bandage inside the packaging with chibi-style or cartoonish features. Instead, the exterior bandage shown has typical bandage features without exaggerated elements. My reasoning is predicated on the visible image content and common understanding of what constitutes chibi-style representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a realistic version of the bandage displayed outside the packaging, showing intricate details like fabric texture and adhesive surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bandage outside the packaging does not exhibit realistic features like detailed fabric texture or adhesive surface. It maintains a minimalistic style consistent with the general illustrative tone of the packaging design. My conclusion comes from observing the graphical style of the bandage and comparing it to typical realistic representations where texture and surface details are emphasized.",
