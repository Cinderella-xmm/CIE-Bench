        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is depicted with exaggerated features typical of chibi-style cartoon characters, such as a large head in proportion to the body and simplified, rounded shapes.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
