    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the photo been converted into a minimalist flat illustration-style sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a sticker-like illustration with simplified shapes and block colors, which is typical of minimalist flat illustration style. The absence of texture and shading, along with the stylized features, confirms this transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the boy and all bird outlines clearly present in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is primarily on the boy's torso and the illustration details on his shirt, without any outlined birds present as in Image A. This suggests a selective inclusion in the illustration that does not involve the birds.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have block colors been used for the boy's skin tones and the birds' feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses block colors for the boy's skin tones, evident from the consistent shade across the visible skin areas. However, since the birds are missing, the use of block colors for their feathers cannot be assessed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background completely removed from the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration-style appearance of Image B has eliminated all background details by converting into a sticker with a plain backdrop, contrasting Image A's detailed background scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the boyâ€™s head been slightly enlarged and the birds shrunk to achieve a neatly arranged composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include the birds, focusing only on the boy and shirt graphics in a simplified form. Thus, the question of resizing relative to birds does not apply.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has a thick white outline been added around the boy and birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a white outline encircling the sticker, common in sticker designs for emphasis against varying backgrounds. However, birds are not part of this image, making it limited to the boy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the image have a transparent background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B has a detached background typical for stickers, it does not exhibit a transparent background, rather a white outline circumscribing the figure.",
