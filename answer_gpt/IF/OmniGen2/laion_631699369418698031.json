    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the totem pole now presented as a miniature scene within a confined space, suggesting a scaled-down 3D environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the totem pole is clearly positioned within a transparent cylindrical glass dome, surrounded by miniature ferns and moss, which implies the creation of a contained, scaled-down 3D environment. This presentation is a typical method used to simulate miniature scenes, and the glass dome serves as the confinement that further emphasizes its miniaturized appearance.",

      "question": "Is the totem pole enclosed within a transparent cylindrical glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show the totem pole inside a clear glass dome, which is a commonly used method to display and protect miniatures or delicate objects. The transparency of the dome allows the viewer to see the totem pole and the surrounding scenery clearly, indicating it is indeed enclosed within such a structure.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there tiny ferns and moss visible at the base of the totem pole inside the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the base of the totem pole surrounded by small green plants, specifically ferns, and moss, which are typical elements in creating natural or forest-like miniature scenes. These elements contribute to the authenticity and aesthetic appeal of the display.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a butterfly perched on the top of the totem pole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a butterfly is clearly perched on top of the transparent dome, rather than directly on the totem pole itself. The presence of the butterfly adds to the overall natural theme and visual appeal of the scene, serving as a decorative element.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits an earthy color palette dominated by natural browns and greens. The totem pole's wood grain texture and the green hues of the ferns and moss complement each other, forming a harmonious natural scene. These colors are typical in representations of natural settings, adding realism and visual warmth.",
