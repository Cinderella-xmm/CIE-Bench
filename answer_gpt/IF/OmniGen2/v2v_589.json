      "question": "Are there exactly five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts chibi-style Russian nesting dolls. A count reveals there are four dolls present: two larger ones and two smaller ones. The visual confirmation of four items leads to the conclusion that there are not five dolls in the image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls exhibit a vibrant lime-green color and texture similar to the shoe and tennis ball in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls have a bright lime-green color. Comparing this with Image A's objects, the shoe and tennis ball, we notice these are also lime-green and possess a similar texture with a slightly pebbled appearance, indicating a resemblance between their color and texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls organized from largest to smallest in size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dolls arranged from the second largest, largest, to two smaller dolls, indicating an organization where the largest is not at the beginning or end. This arrangement skips the typical largest-to-smallest sequential arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls positioned on a sophisticated wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface on which the dolls are placed in Image B depicts a wooden texture with a curved edge, commonly associated with polished, sophisticated furniture. This suggests the dolls are indeed positioned on a wooden table.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is plain and features a solid beige color, which does not compete for attention with the central figures, indicating a subtle and non-distracting setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image maintain a 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The aspect ratio refers to the proportional relationship between width and height. Visually assessing Image B, it appears rectangular and commonly fits within a standard 3:2 horizontal framing. However, there is no specific measurement provided, leading us to conclude by the appearance that it matches this aspect ratio.",
