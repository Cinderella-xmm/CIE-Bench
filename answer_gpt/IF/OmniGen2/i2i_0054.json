      "question": "Is the background changed to a matte solid gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the background is indeed a solid gray color without any patterns, textures, or variations in shade. This uniform color matches the description of a matte solid gray. Without seeing Image A, we can conclude that the background in Image B is indeed a solid gray.",

      "question": "Are there any visible shadows in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B is entirely filled with a solid gray color, with no objects, elements, or edges visible. Therefore, there are no visible shadows in the image because there are no features or objects to create shadows.",

      "question": "Are the banana shape and metal stand curves highlighted effectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is completely gray without any visible objects, shapes, or details. Without any visible content, we cannot say that any shapes or curves are highlighted, as there is nothing present to assess.",

      "question": "Does the image maintain a minimalistic design without unnecessary elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A minimalistic design often involves simplicity and the absence of superfluous features. Image B is entirely gray, lacking any visible elements, which aligns with the concept of minimalism. By having an entirely blank canvas, it inherently avoids unnecessary elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "Minimalism in design focuses on reducing a composition to only its necessary elements. Image B's complete lack of features or distractions fits within this framework. By having a single color with no additional details, it can be regarded as a minimalistic design.",
