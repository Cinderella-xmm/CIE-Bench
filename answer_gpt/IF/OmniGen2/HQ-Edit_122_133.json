      "question": "Are the cardinal and blue jay depicted as 3D anthropomorphic figurines with human-like features and sculptural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal and blue jay appear to be stylized and designed as 3D figurines. They are placed on small stages and possess the glossy, smooth appearance characteristic of sculpted or manufactured models. However, they do not feature human-like attributes such as clothing or facial expressions that are human-like, which is typically associated with anthropomorphic depictions. Therefore, while they are 3D figurines, they lack the human-like features required to be considered anthropomorphic.",
