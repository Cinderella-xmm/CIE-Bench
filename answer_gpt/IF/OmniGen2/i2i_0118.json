        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character, which resembles Pikachu from the Pokémon franchise, is shown with its entire body visible, including the head, body, arms, legs, and tail. A half-body form would mean only the upper part of the character is visible, typically showing just the upper torso and head. Therefore, the character is not in a half-body form as its full body is depicted.",

      "question": "Does the character appear to be jumping out of a children’s tablet screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows Pikachu inside what appears to be a frame, resembling a black-bordered rectangle with rounded corners, a feature common in digital devices like tablets. The visual style, where Pikachu is centrally placed and looks somewhat three-dimensional, suggests an illusion of it jumping out or being part of an interactive digital experience on a tablet screen. Thus, it gives an impression of the character interacting with the viewer as if it’s coming out of the screen.",

      "question": "Are the character's arms open in a welcoming gesture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu's arms are extended outward and upward, which is typically interpreted as a welcoming or inviting gesture. This posture is often used in animation and art to depict friendliness or an invitation to interact. Hence, Pikachu's arm position in Image B can be described as a welcoming gesture.",

      "question": "Does the overall depiction simulate an interactive entertainment effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays Pikachu as if it is part of an interactive digital display, potentially on a tablet. This effect is commonly used in games and apps to enhance the perception of interaction and immersion. The design of Pikachu appearing animatedly and the illusion of it popping out of a framed screen adds to the interactive entertainment feeling, making it seem as if part of a digital experience. Therefore, the image does simulate an interactive entertainment effect.",

      "question": "Does the tablet include features typical of children's tablets, such as rounded edges or colorful design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame around Pikachu is black with rounded edges. While rounded edges are typical of children's tablets for safety and ergonomic reasons, the frame lacks additional colorful or playful design elements that are usually present in children's products to appeal to a younger audience. The absence of color beyond the black frame suggests that while some features like rounded edges are present, the overall design does not incorporate the colorful aspects most common in children's tablets.",
