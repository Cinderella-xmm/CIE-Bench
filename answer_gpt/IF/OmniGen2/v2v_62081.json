      "question": "Has the portrait been reimagined in a dynamic Xieyi style Chinese ink wash painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a more refined and controlled depiction, focusing on smooth, even gradients, especially noticeable in the hair and the coat, rather than the vivid, spontaneous brush strokes seen in Xieyi style Chinese ink wash paintings. Such paintings usually utilize uncontrolled, expressive marks to capture an essence or spirit, whereas Image B adopts a more precise approach.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the texture of the dark hair and the form of the blue coat conveyed using bold, spontaneous black ink strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark hair texture and the form of the blue coat both exhibit smooth transitions and defined shapes, characteristic of careful, controlled application of color rather than bold, spontaneous ink strokes. These elements display uniformity and refinement, which contradicts the typically dynamic and expressive nature of spontaneous black ink strokes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features and cravat articulated using softer, graded grey washes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clean and clear depiction of the cravat and facial features, using distinct, solid colors rather than a softer, graded grey wash technique. The absence of gradual transitions in gray tones suggests a direct approach rather than one utilizing delicate, graded washes.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the portrait captured on a subtly textured, antique white paper ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background paper in Image B is smooth and lacks the visual texture typical of antique paper. The surface appears even and modern, suggesting a plain background rather than one with subtle antique texturing, which often includes visible grain or deviations that mimic aging.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the patterned wooden frame been simplified into a series of suggestive, darker ink outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a wooden frame; instead, it includes a border that is plain and even in color, lacking any representative ink outlines or suggestive designs that would replace the complex pattern of a wooden frame. The border is minimalistic and solid, diverging from the idea of transformed ink outlines.",
