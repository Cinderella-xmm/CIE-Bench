      "question": "Does the edited image display visible, textured brushstrokes across the entire composition, consistent with Impressionist painting techniques?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays visible, textured brushstrokes that give it a painterly effect, similar to techniques used in Impressionist paintings. This style emphasizes the use of distinct strokes that contribute to the overall texture and feeling of the image rather than precise details. The broad use of color and the visible brushstrokes across various areas, like the sky and the subject's clothing, support this aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the scene lit with warm, golden-hour lighting suggestive of dusk, with soft shadows and a glowing horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image is infused with bright and vibrant colors, predominantly using a mix of warm and cool tones rather than specifically focusing on the warm golden-hour lighting typically associated with dusk. The lighting appears more universally bright rather than the focused glow and soft shadows usually seen at dusk, indicating a departure from that particular type of lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the patterns and colors of the subject’s clothing rendered with thick, visible brushstrokes that exaggerate their vibrancy and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the patterns and colors of the subject’s clothing are indeed rendered with thick and visible brushstrokes. This technique enhances the vibrancy and texture of the clothes, giving them an exaggerated, lively appearance that stands out prominently in the image.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of soft, blended warm golden hues with no distinct details, creating a hazy, atmospheric effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the edited image features bold and distinct brushstrokes with a variety of colors, including blue and warm tones, rather than just warm golden hues. It doesn't produce a soft, hazy effect; instead, it maintains a vibrant and lively background with clear, stylized forms. The style used does not suggest a soft and atmospheric haze typical of blending golden hues.",

    {

      "question": "Does the drum surface show layered, textured paint application that gives it a three-dimensional, tactile appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the drum with visible painted texture that enhances its three-dimensional appearance. The paint application on the drum seems layered and textured, creating a tactile impression that is consistent with a painterly style.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the grass and trees in the background stylized with flowing or angular forms that visually mirror the rhythmic motion of the drummer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the grass and trees are represented with stylized, flowing forms. This artistic choice visually complements the rhythmic motion suggested by the drummer, creating a harmonious and dynamic relationship between the subject and the landscape.",
