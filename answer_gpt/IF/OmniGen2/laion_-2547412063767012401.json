      "question": "Are the three figures depicted as mythical guardians wearing armor made of oceanic elements such as coral or wave-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the three figures are wearing armor that appears to be thematic and stylized. However, there are no distinct features or elements that clearly resemble coral, wave-like structures, or other oceanic motifs within the armor design itself. Without explicit visual cues that reflect elements of the oceanic themes such as textures or unique shapes found in coral or waves, they cannot be concluded as oceanic elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background sky is depicted with vibrant shades of blue and purple, contributing to a mystical and fantastical ambiance.

      "question": "Are the three figures rendered as silhouettes against the enhanced sky due to backlighting from the sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are not depicted as full silhouettes. They are illustrated with highlighted details, allowing the visual elements of their armor to be clearly seen. These details distinguish them from being purely silhouettes, indicating they are more integrated into the scene than just contrast outlines.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the title \"Sunset Guardians of the Coastlines\" present at the bottom of the image in bold, serif lettering with a weathered texture resembling ocean spray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the title 'Sunset Guardians of THE ING COASTiNES' prominently at the bottom, using a bold serif font with a style that suggests a weathered texture. This appearance is reminiscent of elements associated with the ocean, like spray, fitting into the coastal and mythic theme. The textual design supports this interpretation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the armor designs of the figures do not display clear or explicit motifs of ocean creatures like seahorses, tentacles, or fish scales. The armor appears stylized but lacks defined elements that one might associate with oceanic creatures specifically, such as recognizable shapes or patterns.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is stylized with elements that suggest a coastal environment, such as the use of colors and horizon lines mimicking water. It is clearly designed with a mythic, graphic novel aesthetic in mind, fitting a narrative or illustrative theme that maintains the essence of a coastal landscape within a stylized context.",
