      "question": "Are bold ink outlines visible around all major elements of the car and scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car and its surrounding elements, such as the wheels and spoiler, are clearly outlined with thick, black lines. This technique is characteristic of comic or cartoon styles, where bold outlines are used to define shapes and separate them from the background, creating a clear and distinct appearance. These outlines are consistently applied throughout the image, confirming the presence of bold ink outlines.",
