      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the oatmeal packaging is displayed, but the text on the box is not clearly readable. While the image shows a bowl with a cereal-like product, there are no explicit visual cues or labels indicating specific ingredients like salmon bits, pumpkin puree, and oats. Therefore, without such direct labeling or imagery, we cannot confirm these ingredients are included based on the visual information from Image B.",
