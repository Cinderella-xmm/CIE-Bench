      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit a 3D style with depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a kitten on a screen, and it appears to be leaping outward with its forelegs extended and its body angled forward, creating the illusion of depth. The use of shadow, perspective, and the angle of the kitten's movement suggests a 3D effect, combined with the screen's angled presentation, which helps enhance the perception of it protruding out of the screen. These visual cues clearly indicate a 3D style with depth perception.",

      "question": "Does the edited image depict the kitten as actively jumping out of the screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten is shown inside a screen in mid-air, with its paws extended forward and a forward-leaning posture, which is indicative of a dynamic action like jumping. The angle and posture suggest movement, and its tail's positioning supports this. The accompanying visual elements of the screen create the illusion that the kitten is leaping out of the display towards the viewer, indicating active movement.",

      "question": "Is the 3D effect in the image achieved without requiring special glasses or external devices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image shows the kitten on a flat screen, and all visual elements creating the 3D perception are integral to the image itself, such as the use of perspective, shadows, and the angle of the display. There is no indication of external devices like special glasses, as the effect is rendered visually within the image such that it can be perceived by anyone viewing it without extra equipment.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the kitten's original appearance, including color and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kitten in both images appears to be a ginger tabby, characterized by its orange stripes and white underbelly. The texture of the fur and the colors remain consistent between Image A and Image B. There are no alterations to these features in the transition to the edited image; hence, the appearance is maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the kitten's features still clearly visible and not obscured by the 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the 3D effects, the kitten's features such as its face, eyes, and fur patterns are still clearly visible. The editing enhances the kitten's dynamic appearance outside the screen without obscuring or distorting its features. High-quality graphics and clear detailing ensure that the kitten's key characteristics are easily discerned.",
