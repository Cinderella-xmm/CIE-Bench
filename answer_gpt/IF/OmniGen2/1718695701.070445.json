      "question": "Is the capybara's body rendered as a polished bronze metallic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the capybara's body with a shiny, reflective surface typical of polished bronze. The texture and color indicate a metallic characteristic rather than the soft, fur-covered appearance seen in Image A. This transformation to a metallic finish suggests the body has been rendered as a polished bronze surface.",

      "question": "Has the blue knitted hat been replaced with an intricately detailed bronze helmet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a knitted hat, the capybara is wearing a helmet. The helmet appears to have intricate detailing, consistent with a design that would be cast in bronze, contrasting with the textured fabric hat in Image A. This substitution of materials and design aligns with the description of a bronze helmet.",

      "question": "Are the sunglasses now composed of glass lenses set in bronze frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the capybara with sunglasses that have a metallic sheen similar to bronze, which implies that the frames have been changed from a plastic or painted material as seen in Image A to bronze. The lenses retain their glassy appearance. Therefore, the description aligns with sunglasses composed of glass lenses set into bronze frames.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, subtle lines and patterns suggest engraving on the shiny bronze surface, mimicking the natural fur patterns seen in Image A. This attention to detail in maintaining the texture as engraved lines on bronze aligns with the description.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the capybara sculpture resting on a base that appears to be marble, characterized by its smooth and veined appearance, which is consistent with marble. The design and coloration indicate that the base is plain and does not distract from the sculpture itself, adhering to a plain and understated presentation.",
