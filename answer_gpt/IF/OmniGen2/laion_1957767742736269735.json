      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the tank's body composed entirely of olive and dark green LEGO bricks, showing a blocky, modular construction consistent with LEGO building style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank's body appears in a uniform color with smooth surfaces characteristic of LEGO bricks rather than the metallic texture of a real tank. The image gives a toy-like appearance reflective of LEGO's construction style. By leveraging the knowledge that LEGO items are often depicted in single or dual tones with interlocking parts, the visual analysis leads to recognizing the possibility of a LEGO-based design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the orange tiger decal been replaced with a pattern made of colorful LEGO plates forming a whimsical tiger face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger decal maintains its position on the tank unchanged from Image A, which features a vibrant orange with defined black lines. The characteristic appearance remains consistent with adhesive decals rather than appearing constructed from LEGO, suggesting that the decal itself has not been altered to look like LEGO.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tankâ€™s treads made of textured LEGO bricks with visible studs and blocky segments, rather than continuous rubber tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays tank treads that resemble segmented LEGO pieces, adhering to the blocky, angular profile of LEGO brick constructions. The distinct studs and blocky segments are indicative of LEGO patterning, in contrast to the continuous tracks typical of real tanks.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tank positioned on a smooth, flat wooden platform without visible gravel or irregular edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank sits on what looks like a featureless, smooth platform lacking the granular consistency or discontinuous surface of gravel. Unlike Image A, which has a clearly defined gravel surface, the edited image conveys an organized, planar appearance resembling manufactured flooring.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a back panel made of green LEGO bricks behind the tank, designed to mimic foliage and replace the natural tree background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B displays a structured panel comprising green LEGO bricks, organized in a manner that imitates the texture of shrubs or foliage. This setup replaces the living trees visible in Image A. By identifying the rectilinear form and uniform coloration, it is deducible that LEGO has been used to simulate the natural backdrop.",
