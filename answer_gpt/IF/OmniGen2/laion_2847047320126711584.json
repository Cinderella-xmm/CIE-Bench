      "question": "Is the edited image structured as a two-panel comic strip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, we can observe that it is divided into four distinct sections rather than two, which are commonly used in comic strips to depict sequences or storylines. Each section contains separate imagery and text, indicating it is meant to be viewed as a multi-panel comic. Therefore, the structure does not conform to the two-panel format.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image feature bold outlines, vibrant colors, and exaggerated expressions typical of pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals bold outlines around characters and objects, vibrant colors such as bright yellow and blue, and exaggerated expressions on the donut characters' faces. These elements are characteristic of pop-art style, which often uses bright colors and bold, simple forms to create eye-catching and lively imagery.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all donuts depicted with doughy limbs, expressive icing eyes, and sugar-crusted armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only one donut is personified with limbs, expressive eyes, and armor-like features. The other donuts are more generic and do not possess these anthropomorphic characteristics, which include limbs or expressive features beyond their basic donut appearance.",

      "question": "Is there a speech bubble in Panel 1 containing the text “Guardians of the Plate, unite!” spoken by a donut character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the panel that contains the depicted donut character does not have a speech bubble with the text “Guardians of the Plate, unite!” Instead, a speech bubble in one of the panels has the text “Gurcando Guardnions of the Plie, unicde!” indicating the text is altered or misspelled.",

      "question": "Does Panel 2 show donuts surrounding a large coffee mug fortress, holding marshmallow spears and chocolate shields?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not visually portray donuts surrounding a large coffee mug as a fortress, nor do they hold marshmallow spears and chocolate shields. The imagery includes donuts and a separate mug in the panel, but they are not arranged or described as an organized fortress or wielding specific weapon-like items.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes text elements such as speech bubbles that are indeed composed in playful, cartoon-style fonts, which are informal and intentionally stylized to match the comic's lighthearted and humorous tone.",
