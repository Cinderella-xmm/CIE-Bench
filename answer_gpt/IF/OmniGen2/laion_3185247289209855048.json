      "question": "Is there a cartoon-style enamel pin representing the hair that features glossy, gold wavy hair with visible pearl embellishments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the second pin from the left displays hair with a glossy, gold finish and includes pearl embellishments on either side of the head, suggesting a cartoon-style representation.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features three cartoon-style enamel pins and none of them represent fur with a soft pink color or a silky texture.

        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all three pins are consistent in showcasing detailed textures and full coloring with vibrant hues such as yellow, pink, and lavender.
