      "question": "Is the skateboarder depicted as a chibi cartoon character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues provided by Image B, there are no indications of a skateboarder or any character whatsoever due to the complete absence of any distinguishable detail. Image B is a blank white image lacking any features or context that could suggest the presence of a chibi cartoon character or any skateboarder. Without these visual details, I must conclude that a skateboarder depicted as a chibi cartoon character is not present.",

      "question": "Does the chibi character wear a gray T-shirt and shorts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a white, featureless canvas. Due to the lack of visual information, I cannot identify any chibi character, nor can I discern clothing attributes such as a gray T-shirt and shorts. There are no elements in the image relevant to this description.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the head of the chibi character noticeably larger compared to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B is entirely blank, there is no depiction of a chibi character, nor are any body proportions visible. The absence of any character or details prevents any assessment of proportional differences between a head and body. Therefore, no chibi character or proportion can be observed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that Image B is completely blank and lacks any defining features or objects, I cannot observe a skateboard or any item that could be interpreted as such. The absence of detail prevents assessment of any cartoonification of a skateboard or anything resembling it.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a completely white surface with no discernible features, including a background. Therefore, no simplified, hand-drawn city skyline or any sort of background is evident in Image B.",
