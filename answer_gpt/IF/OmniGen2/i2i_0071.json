      "question": "Has the train been transformed into a futuristic maglev train design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B shows a sleek and aerodynamic design that is characteristic of futuristic maglev trains. The train in the image has a smooth, continuous shape and lacks visible wheels, which are common visual cues signifying maglev technology. Maglev trains usually have a streamlined body for high-speed travel, similar to what is depicted.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the train retain the original white and red color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train features a prominent white and red color scheme. The main body of the train is white, with red elements at the lower section. This color scheme is visually consistent with traditional train designs that utilize these colors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the train incorporate elements indicative of maglev technology?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train in Image B is depicted with a streamlined, aerodynamic shape, which is commonly associated with maglev trains. Additionally, it lacks visible wheels and rails, which suggests levitation, a hallmark of maglev technology. These elements combined define the train as indicative of maglev technology.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the train still appear recognizable as a train despite the futuristic changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the transformation into a more futuristic design, Image B shows a train that retains fundamental characteristics such as the elongated structure and windows associated with trains. The aerodynamic shape is advanced but still consistent with modern train aesthetics, keeping it recognizable.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have all parts of the original train been transformed into the new maglev design, with no elements of the old design remaining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B shows a significant transformation into a futuristic design, the train maintains its traditional color scheme and general shape. These elements may be part of the original design, suggesting not all aspects have been entirely transformed.",
