      "question": "Is the background showing an African savanna scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a landscape with vast grassland and flat terrain, accompanied by sparse, distant trees on the horizon, which is characteristic of a savanna. African savannas are known for their grassy plains with scattered trees, which align with the features seen in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the image set against a dark, night-time sky indicative of nighttime?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is a deep blue transitioning to black, which is typical of a night-time setting. Such a color palette often indicates nighttime, especially when combined with visible stars and celestial features.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the Milky Way clearly visible in the sky above the savanna?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a prominent, bright band of stars and clouds in the sky, which is characteristic of the Milky Way galaxy as observed from Earth. The presence of this distinct pattern, which is visually clear and recognizable, confirms it as the Milky Way.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are multiple stars visible alongside the Milky Way in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image showcases countless small white points in the sky surrounding the Milky Way, which are indicative of stars. This visual abundance of individual points against the dark sky confirms the presence of multiple stars beside the Milky Way.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the train and railway tracks appear seamlessly integrated into the savanna background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible train or railway tracks present. The image shows a natural savanna landscape without man-made structures typically associated with train tracks. Hence, without any visual evidence of a train or tracks, they cannot be considered to be seamlessly integrated or otherwise.",
