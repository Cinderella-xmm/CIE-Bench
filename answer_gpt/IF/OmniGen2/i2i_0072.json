    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the person appear in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person appears to have a smooth texture and exaggerated round features, characteristic of 3D cartoon renderings. This style involves using digital techniques to create simplified and stylized representations that are common in animated films or games.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the frisbee been replaced with a spinning metal shield?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual inspection of Image B reveals a circular object behind the person, which has a metallic sheen and resembles a shield. The smooth surface and concentric circular designs suggest it is a shield, rather than a frisbee, indicating a replacement has occurred.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background now a sci-fi training ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background with futuristic elements, angular surfaces, and glowing lights, typical of sci-fi architecture. This contrasts sharply with typical outdoor or street environments and suggests a sci-fi training ground setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the girlâ€™s original pose and expression been maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, the girl's pose, standing on a block with raised hands, remains unchanged between Image A and Image B. However, the expression or facial features cannot be determined due to obfuscation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the metal shield look metallic and seem to be spinning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shield in Image B has a metallic appearance, indicated by its shiny surface and reflective properties. Despite the lack of motion blur or dynamic elements suggesting spinning, the design implies potential movement more suited to sci-fi contexts.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
