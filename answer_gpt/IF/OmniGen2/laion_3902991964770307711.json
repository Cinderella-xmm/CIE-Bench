      "question": "Are the three top portions of the candelabra replaced with transparent, tapered glass perfume caps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a perfume bottle, which has a transparent, tapered glass cap as part of its design. The top of the perfume bottle indicates it's the type commonly used for spraying perfume, consistent with a cap design. This analysis is based on the visual structure of the perfume bottle, which typically includes such features. In contrast, Image A shows a candelabra, with solid metal holders designed to hold candles. Comparing Image A and Image B, Image A's candle holders are not transparent, indicating that the perfume cap design has replaced the original candle holders.",

      "question": "Have the curved arms connecting the top portions been replaced with sleek, seamless gold-finish tubing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible curved arms since it is a singular object (a perfume bottle) with no comparative structure to support different points. The design doesn't include arms or tubes connecting parts; it’s a bottle with a base and a cap. In Image A, the candelabra has distinct curved arms connecting its candle holders. Therefore, since Image B doesn't show any tubing structure at all, there is no replacement.",

      "question": "Is there a minimalist brand logo embossed on the base of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the base of the perfume bottle, there isn't a visible minimalist brand logo embossed. What appears is a design element usually found on perfume bottles, where labels and branding are typically on the front, not embossed on the base. In Image A, the base of the candelabra is plain without any branding, emphasizing the lack of any embossing. Therefore, there is no indication of a brand logo being embossed on Image B's base.",

      "question": "Are intricate floral-engraved patterns visible across the surface of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the perfume bottle includes an intricate floral pattern visible around the label area, which seems to be part of its decorative design. Perfume bottles often use such intricate patterns for aesthetic purposes. In comparison, Image A’s candelabra shows a smooth metallic finish without any such patterns. Thus, the presence of floral-engraved patterns in Image B is a design element added to the perfume bottle.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a label with an elegant script font visibly positioned on the front face of the perfume bottle, which is typical for branding and providing details about the perfume. This label includes a script most likely representing the brand or perfume name. In Image A, no such script font label exists on the candelabra, as it's a decorative metal piece rather than a product requiring branding. Thus, the subtle script font label is a feature of Image B.",
