      "question": "Is the astronaut rendered in a cartoon style with simplified features, bold lines, or exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is depicted with bold outlines, simplified features, and a more stylized design typical of cartoon art. The suit design is less detailed and more exaggerated compared to realistic depictions. This can be deduced from the use of strong colors, defined contours, and simplified shapes which are common characteristics of cartoon illustrations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible action zig-zag lines surrounding the astronaut’s limbs or body to indicate motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible action zig-zag lines surrounding the astronaut to suggest motion. The illustration style emphasizes stationary posture through solid lines and minimal dynamic indicators.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the astronaut’s suit feature decorative celestial motifs such as stars, planets, or galaxies in blue and silver tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the astronaut’s suit adorned with celestial motifs such as stars, which are depicted in blue tones. Such elements are an artistic choice adding thematic decoration to the suit, not seen in typical astronaut suits. This stylistic addition matches the overall cartoon theme of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the moon surface beneath the astronaut depicted in an illustrated, non-photorealistic style with simplified or graphic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon’s surface is presented with simplified and graphic elements typical of illustrations. The lunar terrain is stylized, featuring smooth curves and distinct outlines rather than realistic textures or detail, which indicates a non-photorealistic representation.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a space-themed border featuring stars and celestial elements. The background appears textured, simulating a card stock look, which is enhanced by its white color. These design elements contribute to the overall stylized and illustrative theme of the image.",
