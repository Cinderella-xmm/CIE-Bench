      "question": "Has the image been transformed from a flat jersey display into a full promotional poster layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design is more dynamic and visually engaging, which is typical of a promotional poster. There are graphic elements such as text, additional colors (orange), and an illustration style that aims to capture attention, all of which indicate a transformation into a promotional layout. In contrast, Image A is a straightforward display of the jersey in a less dynamic manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the jersey as an anthropomorphic cyclist character with a body shape and posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the jersey as if it is worn on an implied human form, such as a cyclist character. The visual representation includes a star on the chest and an implied human posture with a helmet placed above, suggesting the presence of a human figure. This differs from Image A, which shows the jersey laid flat without any human form.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are facial features (such as eyes, nose, or mouth) present on the chest area where the star was originally located?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the star was in Image A does not depict facial features like eyes, nose, or mouth. Instead, the star remains in place, which maintains the original design element without altering it to add facial details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image limited to blue, white, red, and gray, matching the original jersey's color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B introduces additional orange color elements around the character, which differs from the original color scheme in Image A that was strictly blue, white, red, and gray. Thus, the dominant colors in Image B are not strictly limited to those in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there stylized motion lines or speed effects visible around the anthropomorphic cyclist character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes visual effects that resemble motion lines, particularly the orange elements around the character. These lines suggest movement or speed, adding a dynamic quality that is not present in the original Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the text \"Ride Like a Star!\" displayed in bold, diagonal font in the bottom left corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Ride Like a Star!' is clearly presented in a bold, diagonal style in the lower part of the image. This positioning and style are aimed at attracting attention and emphasizing the promotional message.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the overall layout combine structured composition (e.g., balanced elements) with energetic visual cues (e.g., motion lines, strong angles)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a structured composition through the balanced placement of design elements such as the star, text, and the anthropomorphic depiction of a cyclist. Energetic visual cues are also present, such as motion lines and the dynamic pose of the character, creating an overall energetic yet organized appearance.",
