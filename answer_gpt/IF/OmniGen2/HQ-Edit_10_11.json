      "question": "Is the gorilla depicted as a wood-carved sculpture rather than a living animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining the visual cues in Image B, the gorilla appears to have a uniform wooden texture and lacks the natural elements of a living animal, such as varied fur textures. The image is consistent with the characteristics of a wooden sculpture, showcasing polished surfaces and engraved details typical of carvings. This aligns with the idea of a handcrafted object rather than a photograph of a real gorilla.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the contours of the gorilla's body defined using multiple shades of brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the gorilla with varying shades of brown, which are typically used in carvings to highlight depth and dimension. These shades emphasize the contours and details of the sculpture, such as muscle definition and joints, similar to stained wood techniques in carvings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are detailed fur-like textures engraved into the surface of the wooden sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gorilla sculpture in Image B prominently features engraved lines that simulate fur, which are carved into the wood. This technique gives the illusion of fur-like texture, characteristic of wooden sculptures that depict animals.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the arms and legs of the sculpture visibly smoother than the rest of the body, lacking fine anatomical detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms and legs of the sculpture in Image B are visibly smoother, with less intricate carving compared to areas with engraved fur-like textures. This simplification is typical in wood sculptures where anatomical details are minimized relative to more textured areas.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the leafy backdrop been replaced with an etched wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the natural forest background seen in the original image has been replaced by a smooth, wooden surface. This wooden surface is consistent throughout the image and contrasts starkly with the original leafy backdrop, suggesting it has been replaced.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there a few dark-toned leaf shapes integrated into the wooden background, matching the wood carving style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates dark-toned leaf shapes into the wooden background, which aesthetically match the overall wood carving style. These shapes seem intentionally placed and etched, complementing the sculpture's thematic elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the gorilla maintain the same seated posture and hand placement as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the gorilla maintains the same seated posture with similar hand placement, indicating that the posture was retained during the transition from a photograph to a sculpture. The presence of aligned body positions in both images confirms the continuity of pose.",
