      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the top center, the title 'Parisian Park Etiquette' is prominently displayed.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an infographic layout where a pathway is centrally located, visually dividing the image into two symmetrical halves.

      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Engage' section is not present; instead, the main sections are 'Relax' and 'Capture.' There are no speech bubble graphics connected by lines to walking figures in the given sections of the infographic. This arrangement indicates the absence of such an 'Engage' section.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the 'Capture' section of Image B, there is a depiction of a camera icon. However, this icon does not feature the Eiffel Tower within its design; instead, it shows a simplified illustration of a camera with a lens. The section does focus on capturing images, fitting the theme, but the specific query about the Eiffel Tower within the camera design is not observed.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a color palette dominated by cool greens, particularly in the park foliage and pathways. The human figures within the infographic are indeed represented as simple, stylized silhouettes, which aligns with conventional design practices for ease of interpretation and visual uniformity in such formats.",
