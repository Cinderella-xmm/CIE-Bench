    "Question": "Q1: Is the vase now composed of clear, faceted crystal material that mimics the original shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is transparent and has a faceted design that is typically associated with crystal. This creates a reflective and sparkling appearance, which aligns with how clear, faceted crystal generally appears. Therefore, combining visual elements and common knowledge about crystal materials, the vase in Image B is indeed composed of clear, faceted crystal material that mimics a typical vase shape.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the decorative panels on the vase replaced with etched abstract floral patterns in crystal, rather than painted figures or scenes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible decorative panels featuring etched abstract floral patterns or painted figures. The vase appears to have a uniform faceted crystal design. Without distinct panels depicting floral patterns, it suggests that the focus is on the sparkling facets of the crystal, rather than specific etched or painted decorations.",

    "Question": "Q3: Have all the flowers been replaced with pastel-colored, translucent, intricately carved crystal blossoms?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers appear to be pastel-colored and have a translucent quality, indicative of being crafted from crystal or glass. They are intricately designed, resembling carved blossoms. This contrasts with any organic or fabric material flowers, which would not have a translucent appearance.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the vase placed on a minimalist, flat, reflective mirrored pedestal that shows a clear reflection of the vase and flowers?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is situated on a flat, white pedestal. However, there are no indications of it being reflective or mirrored since there is no visible reflection of the vase and flowers on its surface. This suggests it is more of a typical flat surface rather than a reflective one.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the crystal vase maintain the same overall shape, size, and structural features (such as handles and foot) as the original ornate vase?",
    "explanation": "Comparing the two images, Image A features a vase with ornate structural features including handles and a figurine design. In contrast, Image B presents a vase crafted from crystal without evident handles or foot. The shape is also simplified to a more modern crystal shape. Thus, the overall ornamental appearance of the original vase is not maintained in the crystal design.",
