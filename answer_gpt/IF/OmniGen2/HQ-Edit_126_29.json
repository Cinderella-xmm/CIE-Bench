      "question": "Is the room visually transformed into a thematic infographic with Victorian literature elements, including layout and design consistent with an educational or narrative display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents not a real room but rather a thematic display akin to an infographic. The prominent depiction of a book with text, gears, and ornate designs suggest a narrative focus, likely related to a Victorian-era theme. The presence of decorative elements and clear, educational-style captions indicate alignment with literary and educational displays.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the clock face been replaced with a visual representation of a book with animated or implied page-turning motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a large open book as part of the design. While the book is not physically animated, its open presentation implies a narrative or instructional element. The clock-like features are integrated within the page layout, enhancing the thematic cohesion but not directly indicating motion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible text snippets on the wallpaper that detail historical milestones in timekeeping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dark background with books but no wallpaper text revealing historical milestones related to timekeeping. The central focus appears to be on the open book and decorative clock, rather than detailed snippet backgrounds.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the framed artwork above the fireplace now display an image of an ancient sundial instead of a landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a framed artwork above the fireplace as the imagery is centered around a book and clock-like design. There's no indication of a sundial replacing previous landscape imagery because that specific area and item are absent from this layout.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized clock hands resemble pens, consistent with the literary theme of the display. These elements help merge the imagery of a book and clock face, enhancing the design coherence with narrative and educational ties.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently displays serif fonts with decorative flourishes that align with art-nouveau aesthetics. The captioned text, especially the title, incorporates stylistic elements typical of historically styled and elegant typography.",
