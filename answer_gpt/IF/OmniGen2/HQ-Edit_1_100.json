      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a visible calendar layout element (such as a date, month, or decorative border) indicating the image is formatted as an art calendar page?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of bookshelves and books, with no visible elements such as dates, months, or decorative borders typically indicative of a calendar design. The setup appears more like a framed portrait within a wooden structure than a calendar page. The layout focuses on the figure and the book, without any additional calendar-specific components.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure exhibit characteristics of a half-cartoon style, such as stylized facial features, smooth lines, or exaggerated proportions while maintaining realism in other areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure showcases smooth lines and simplified elements that are characteristic of a cartoon or illustrative style, especially in the way the garment and hands are depicted. This creates an impression of a half-cartoon style, with a polished, finished look that blends elements of realism and stylization.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the book in the foreground visibly longer than a normal book, with an elongated shape that exceeds typical proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book in the figure's hands appears to have a normal size relative to the figure, appropriate for a standard reading book. There are no exaggerated proportions or elongated appearances that suggest it is abnormally long. The book's dimensions fit typical expectations for its context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sleeves display soft, flowing drapery with visible folds and gentle curvature, suggesting fabric texture and movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sleeves of the garment have stylized, rigid folds rather than soft, flowing drapery. The dress style suggests a structured and simplified version of fabric without the dynamic folds or movement associated with fabric texture in reality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the buttons on the figureâ€™s garment decorated with visible golden filigree patterns, such as delicate engravings or ornate designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buttons are presented as golden and stylized, but they do not have intricate engravings or ornate designs typical of filigree patterns. They appear as basic shapes with emphasis on their structural simplicity rather than ornamental detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the library shelves stylized or positioned to form a wooden frame around the central figure and scene, creating a framed composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden frame around the central figure suggests a deliberate composition choice to present the scene as a framed image. The bookshelves are arranged to contribute to this framing effect, supporting the scene within a structured border.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are visual elements such as warm lighting, aged books, wooden surfaces, and focused reading posture present to enhance the scholarly atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image composition includes elements such as wooden bookshelves and a focus on the book and reading posture. However, the overall presentation, with stylized and simplified lines, lacks the warmth and detailed texture associated with real wood and aged books. Thus, it portrays more of a formal, illustrated scene than a richly atmospheric scholarly setting.",
