      "question": "Is the light bulb character depicted with a smiling face including eyes and a mouth, while maintaining the original glass and metal cage design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light bulb character has a smiling face with exaggerated eyes and an open mouth, evoking a lively and anthropomorphic appearance. The original glass and metal cage design is largely retained, giving continuity to the structure of the light bulb, while adding the comic character features. The combination of the original structural elements and the cartoon face aligns with this description.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does Panel 1 show the anthropomorphic bulb character standing with arms akimbo inside a vintage laboratory environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 1 of Image B shows the anthropomorphic light bulb character, but it lacks arms and thus cannot be depicted with arms akimbo. The background appears to be a vintage laboratory setting with shelves and equipment, reinforcing that the setting matches the question's description, but the character posture is incorrect.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a text box in Panel 1 that contains the exact quote “I illuminate ideas brighter than the brightest innovation!”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the text box contains the phrase: 'I ilumimates brighter than the brightest emovatation!' which differs significantly from the provided quote, primarily in the specific wording and phrasing.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does Panel 2 show the bulb character in an energetic swinging motion, with visible sparks being emitted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 in Image B displays the bulb character in a static placement rather than a swinging motion. While there are lines suggesting illumination or energy, it does not convey motion or sparks as would be necessary for an energetic swinging motion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors used in Image B are indeed rich and bold, employing a range of primary colors like blues and yellows, alongside metallic shades on the bulb cage, all of which are consistent with a classic comic book aesthetic, making it lively and visually appealing.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both panels of Image B, retro gadgets and gears are distinctly visible, such as shelves with bottles and drawers in Panel 1 and various apparatus-like items in Panel 2, suggesting a retro or vintage setting.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is all text rendered in bold, capitalized letters using a 1950s comic book-style font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is in bold letters but not entirely capitalized. The font style is reminiscent of mid-century comic books, though the lowercase letters mean that it does not meet the criteria of being fully capitalized as specified in the question.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to be designed as a single cohesive image without explicit visual separation to identify it as a two-panel comic strip. The question refers to a clear separation which is not evident, hence indicating the image is rather one complete scene or illustration.",
