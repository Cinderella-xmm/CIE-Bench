        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is visually distinct and reminiscent of aged, weathered parchment paper, a common design element used for treasure maps. This is evidenced by the beige color, rough edges, and faint map lines, which contrast with the wooden table background of Image A. These visual changes suggest a transformation into a map, typically found on old, weathered parchment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the croissants, macarons, and cupcakes are still prominently featured overlaying the map, serving as visual landmarks. These elements are strategically placed across the map, resembling the symbols or markers typically found on a treasure map. In Image A, they are arranged as part of a food display, indicating a repurposing for the map theme in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a dotted trail traversing the parchment background, synonymous with treasure maps, directing attention from one landmark to another. However, there is no evident large frosting-shaped 'X' marking the end of the trail, which is a common final point on traditional treasure maps.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a nautical-style compass rose prominently featured, which is a nod to a traditional navigation tool used on maps. Additionally, there are raspberries placed artistically near the pastries. These elements are absent in Image A and are clearly added to enhance the thematic design of a playful, pastry-themed treasure map.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements in Image B are arranged to create an impression of a whimsical journey through a pastry wonderland, with landmarks, trails, and decorative elements like compass roses and berries. The combination creates an engaging and seamless integration of pastries into a map-like setting, an idea not present in Image A, which merely showcases the food items.",
