      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The font choice in Image B is simple, clean, and legible and appropriately conveys a sense of freshness and sweetness associated with fruit branding. Minimalism in typography helps convey the message without overpowering the visual elements of the apples, making it fitting for a brand poster.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, aside from the text addition, changes are evident in the overall brightness and color saturation. The background in Image B is lighter, and the apples appear more vibrant with heightened contrasts, indicating additional edits beyond just the text addition.",

The background is transformed into a plain white, removing the original setting elements like the wooden surface and any greenery, indicating extra edits beyond text insertion.",
