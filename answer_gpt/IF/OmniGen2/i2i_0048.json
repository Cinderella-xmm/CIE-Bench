      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the contrast in the image been enhanced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the contrast appears increased. The zebras stand out more starkly against the darker background due to the heightened distinction between the black and white stripes and the visible areas of the grassy terrain, which now appear more subdued and less saturated, indicative of enhanced contrast.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there visible improvement in the sharpness of zebras and the grassy ground in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B has higher contrast, the sharpness of the zebras and the grass appears to be reduced. The zebras and grass show less definition and finer detail compared to what typically would be perceived as improved sharpness.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the natural textures of the zebras' stripes and the grassland detailed and clear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The details of the zebrasâ€™ stripes and the grass in Image B are not clearly defined. The zebras are highlighted, but the textures and details of the natural elements seem to have been lost or are not as prominent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B does not present any additions of urban elements such as buildings, vehicles, or people. It maintains the rural aesthetic with a focus on the zebras set in natural grassland surroundings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B maintains the original layout of the zebras within the grassland setting. Although processed, it reflects the same positioning and overall natural setting as noted in the original image.",
