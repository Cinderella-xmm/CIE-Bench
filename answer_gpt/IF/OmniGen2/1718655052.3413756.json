      "question": "Are the hat and scarf now made of wood with visible carving marks and engraved textures that mimic the original woolly pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and scarf appear to be made of a material with a texture and surface that is reminiscent of wood. The carved appearance with visible lines and patterns provides an effect similar to that of carved wood, replacing the woven fiber look seen in typical woolly accessories. This suggests a transformation from fabric to a wooden rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the dog's fur coat been replaced with LEGO bricks arranged in a way that shows multiple colors and maintains a layered, textured appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what resembles the dog's ‘fur coat’ consists of wooden carvings, not LEGO bricks, as there is no distinct separation or indication of individual LEGO pieces. Instead, the surface appears smooth with detailed carving, suggesting a single-piece sculpture rather than a multi-colored, layered LEGO construction.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background now a plain, light-colored wooden tabletop with no distracting elements, providing a clean contrast to the dog and its accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background that is a simple, light-colored surface consistent with a wooden tabletop. This environment lacks any extraneous elements, creating a minimalist setting that contrasts sharply with the carved figure in the foreground, indicating a change from a more complex or textured background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the dog’s facial features, including eyes, nose, mouth, and expression, remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth, appear to have transitioned into a stylized form that matches the carved wooden theme. These features, although similar in placement, are less detailed and more abstract than in a realistic depiction, indicating a change.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks used for the coat composed of warm colors such as orange, red, yellow, or brown to visually suggest warmth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the wooden appearance of the object in Image B, there are no LEGO bricks utilized in the coat. Instead, the consistent warm hue of the wood itself, likely representing natural wood tones, imparts a feeling of warmth, but as these are not LEGO bricks, the answer is based on materials rather than colors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the scene still include falling snow, and if so, does it coexist logically with the wooden background and LEGO brick coat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no sign of falling snow, as the scene centers around a wooden sculpture on a clean, unobtrusive wooden surface. This environment does not lend itself to depicting weather conditions such as snow, aligning more with an indoor setting.",
