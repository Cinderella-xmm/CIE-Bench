    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figure seated in the same pose as in the original image, with hands resting on the armrests and body upright?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the figure's pose appears identical as both show the figure seated upright with hands resting on the armrests. This suggests a deliberate choice to keep the pose consistent despite other changes.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure's outfit include visible brass components, gears, or mechanical embellishments integrated into a Victorian-style jacket or coat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a distinctly Victorian and steampunk aesthetic with visible brass components and gears on the figure's attire, unlike in Image A where the attire is a traditional ornate uniform without such embellishments. This suggests a thematic alteration towards a mechanical or industrial style.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the original chair been replaced with a throne that features visible cogwheels, rivets, or metallic mechanical structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the throne appears to include more elaborate and possibly mechanical decorations, as opposed to the more classic and ornamental throne in Image A. However, visible cogwheels or rivets aren't prominent, so without such elements, the specific mechanical nature of the structure is not apparent.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's attire and background exhibit a dominant dark green, brown, and brass color palette which aligns with a steampunk aesthetic, in contrast to Image Aâ€™s lighter shades with whites and golds. These colors establish the thematic overall look.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there visible smoke or steam in the background, particularly near the base of the throne or behind the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visual cues of smoke or steam in the background near the figure and around the throne area, reflecting a steampunk theme, which is absent in Image A. This addition enhances the industrial atmosphere of the edited image.",
