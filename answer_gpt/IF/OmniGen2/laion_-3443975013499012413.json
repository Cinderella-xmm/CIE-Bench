      "question": "Has the wooden material been replaced with transparent blue and teal crystalline material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a sculpture made of transparent blue and teal crystalline material. This is evident from the clear, translucent nature of the sculpture, which is distinct from any opaque or matte materials such as wood. The color and material give the sculpture a glass-like appearance, indicating that the wooden material seen in the original image has been replaced.",

      "question": "Do the facets and angles of the sculpture accurately represent the fish's scales and curved body structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture clearly features facets and angles that mimic the structural details of a fish's scales and curved body. The carved sections and contours are well-defined, lending an authentic representation of the fish's anatomy. This suggests careful craftsmanship and design to capture these aspects accurately.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sculpture exhibit glossy, reflective surfaces that suggest water-like fluidity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays highly glossy and reflective surfaces that resemble water's fluidity. The transparent crystalline material enhances the fluid-like appearance, and its ability to reflect light contributes to the illusion of motion and fluidity, akin to water.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sculpture in a white gallery space. The background is simple and lacks any notable distractions, consisting only of plain, white walls. This minimalist setting highlights the artwork without any additional elements that could divert attention.",

      "choices": [

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B is positioned on a white pedestal. While the pedestal does elevate the artwork, it does not appear to be mirrored, as there is no visible reflection of the sculpture's image on its surface. The pedestal maintains a simple and unreflective appearance, consistent with the gallery's minimalist aesthetic.",
