      "question": "Is the image split into two distinct panels, one on the left and one on the right (or top and bottom), forming a comic layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is split into two vertical panels, one on the left and one on the right, which is typical for a comic layout. Each panel is differentiated by its content, with the left panel featuring a bear character and the right panel showcasing a visual representation of a salmon's life stages.",

        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble in Panel 1 does not precisely contain the text 'Ever wondered how a salmon ends up in a bear's mouth?' It has a similar sentiment but with intentionally scrambled or distorted words for humorous effect.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 does have a fact box with text that closely resembles 'Journey's end in the river gives life to the forest.', but the sentence contains minor misspellings or typographical adjustments.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text elements in the image are not rendered in a typically clear, modern sans-serif font; instead, they feature a playful and distorted style that adds to the comic's humor and thematic elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the text uses humorous distortion, the panels logically connect by illustrating the journey of a salmon and its interaction with a bear. The content effectively conveys an educational narrative about the salmon's life stages and its ecological role.",
