    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a visible, cartoon-style face with expressive features (eyes, mouth, etc.) drawn on the frame near the handlebars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a cartoon-style face is visible with an expressive eye located on the frame near the handlebars. The eye design suggests animate features, indicative of a cartoon style. The placement and styling of the eye align with typical animated character designs where facial expressions are emphasized, even when only partial features are depicted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there cartoon-style limbs (arms or legs) visibly extending from the front and/or rear wheel hubs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no visible extensions from the wheel hubs that resemble cartoon-style limbs such as arms or legs. This specific addition is commonly seen in illustrations where inanimate objects are anthropomorphized, but in this case, the image remains faithful to resembling a stylized bicycle without such limbs.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there dynamic motion lines (such as streaks or curved lines) surrounding the bike or its wheels to indicate speed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are several dynamic motion lines surrounding the motorcycle, particularly near the edges pointing away from the wheels. These lines are stylized to convey motion and speed, a common technique in illustrations designed to suggest movement or the action of the vehicle, enhancing the dynamic and lively look of the motorcycle.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the red frame been redesigned to resemble a superhero suit, including visual elements like patterns, textures, or symbols associated with a hero costume?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle's design does not specifically evoke a superhero suit with elements such as textures, patterns, or symbols directly associated with hero costumes. While the design is stylized, it remains true to typical animation or cartoon aesthetics without referencing superhero themes in its visual motifs explicitly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains text reading 'VOOM!!' in a stylized, bold font typical of comic-book sound effects. This type of lettering is commonly used to indicate motion or sound in animated or comic book visuals, enhancing the dynamic and lively feel of the illustration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is designed with a comic book aesthetic, featuring exaggerated features, such as the large eye on the frame. The use of bold lines, vibrant colors, and dynamic composition, including motion lines and stylized fonts, are characteristic elements consistent with lively animated characters seen in comic books.",
