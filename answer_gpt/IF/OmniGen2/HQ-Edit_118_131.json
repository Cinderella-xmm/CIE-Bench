      "question": "Is the entire scene, including the elephant teapot and base, enclosed within a curved glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cue of a transparent, curved glass structure completely surrounding the teapot and its base is evident, suggesting the scene is entirely enclosed within a glass dome. The dome is clear and rounded, resembling a typical cloche used for display purposes. Therefore, based on these observations, the conclusion is that the scene is indeed enclosed within a dome.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible gears and copper-colored accents added to the surface of the elephant teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows distinct metallic details such as gears and ornate copper-colored accents on the side of the elephant teapot. The presence of these mechanical elements gives the teapot a steampunk aesthetic, which is supported by their visible shape and color. Thus, the teapot indeed features gears and copper accents.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the base feature simulated wooden floorboards with scattered tea leaves and tiny silver utensils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base is not designed with wooden floorboards but rather has a mossy green surface. However, there are small silver utensils, such as spoons, and leaves scattered around the scene. Hence, although the base does not consist of wooden floorboards, the presence of silver utensils and leaves gives it a certain decorative flair.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are soft moss accents visibly embedded in the base area inside the glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's base prominently features a soft, mossy texture, evident in the lush green color and texture that forms the ground within the dome. This type of surface is often used for decoration to simulate natural environments. Therefore, the base within the dome evidently includes moss accents.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there visible steam emanating from the tip of the elephantâ€™s trunk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts steam visibly rising from the tip of the teapot's trunk, indicating that the teapot is functioning or displaying the simulated act of steaming, which is often used to emphasize the activity or warmth associated with teapots. Thus, steam is indeed emanating from the trunk.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the scene surrounded by intricate, vine-like metalwork that forms part of the dome or base structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene does not show any vine-like metalwork around the dome or base. The glass dome is smooth and clear without additional ornamentation. Similarly, the base doesn't include metalwork forming vine-like structures. Thus, there is no intricate metalwork surrounding the scene.",
