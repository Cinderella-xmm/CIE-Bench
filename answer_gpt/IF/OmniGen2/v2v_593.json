      "question": "Has the kangaroo been redesigned to resemble a Funko Pop figure box in an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a product box that is designed in a way similar to the International Pop collector figures, which are often presented in boxes showcasing an isometric perspective. The packaging design, including a partially transparent front showing the toy inside, strongly resembles that style. Thus, it seems that the kangaroo has been redesigned in such a way that it mimics this kind of packaging.",

      "question": "Is the packaging labeled with the name \"BOUNCY COMPANION\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text on the packaging in Image B indeed reads 'BOUNCY COMPANION', which implies a playful and charming theme appropriate for a product like a toy kangaroo figure.",

      "question": "Does the box contain a chibi-style kangaroo figure with a pouch, a grassy base, and hopping-related elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a chibi-style (cute, simplified) kangaroo figure within the box. The kangaroo is designed with exaggerated features typical of chibi style, such as large eyes and a simplified form. It is placed on a grassy base, and the design elements, such as attention to a possible 'bouncy' or hopping theme, complement the kangaroo character.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a chibi-style toy kangaroo figure outside the packaging that is not highly realistic. It does not have intricate texture details or lighting that emulate a real kangaroo, as it keeps a cartoonish, simplified design consistent with collectibles like Funko Pops.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original image (Image A) showcases a real kangaroo in a natural setting. In Image B, there is a product box and a toy figure, but the real kangaroo's specific pose and natural environment are not maintained. It instead focuses on the chibi-style interpretation. Therefore, the original pose and setting have not been preserved in Image B.",
