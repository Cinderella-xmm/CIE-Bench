      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit characteristics of a Swiss Design poster, such as clean lines, minimalism, and a focus on typography?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design features clean lines and a minimalist aesthetic, characteristics typical of Swiss Design. The figures and shapes are simplified, with bold, flat colors and an emphasis on clarity and function. The text is straightforward and well-integrated, focusing on essential information without unnecessary embellishments. These elements indicate a Swiss Design influence.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the layout of the edited image strongly asymmetrical?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition of the elements, particularly the position of the child and the adult on skateboards, shows an asymmetrical balance, where the subjects are offset rather than being centered or symmetrically positioned. This layout helps create a dynamic visual tension, which is often used in various design approaches to add interest.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the human figures and the background tent been simplified into flat graphic shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the human figures and the background elements, including what represents the tent, are reduced to flat graphic shapes. The figures lack detailed features and instead consist of bold outlines and solid colors. This approach is consistent with graphic simplification for a cleaner, more stylized appearance like that in vector art or graphic design posters.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the colors in the edited image restricted to blues, whites, and the man's green shirt as an accent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B is distinctly restricted, with prominent use of blues and whites for the background and overall scene, while the man's green shirt serves as a contrasting accent color. This use of a limited color palette is a common design strategy to maintain visual coherence and focus.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text 'SKATE FOR ALL' integrated in a bold, clean sans serif typeface across the upper cloudy sky region?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'SKATE FOR ALL' appears at the top of the image in a bold, clean sans serif font. This style choice is consistent with the modern and minimalist aesthetic typical in many design disciplines, providing readability and instant recognition, especially against the simplified and flat backdrop of what represents the cloudy sky.",
