      "question": "Does the edited image depict the spiral staircase as a serpent creature rather than a standard architectural structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is a spiral staircase with evenly spaced steps and a wooden railing. The visual cues indicate a well-maintained architectural design typical of staircases without any features suggesting it is a depiction of a serpent creature. World knowledge supports that staircases are functional architectural elements rather than fantastical representations unless explicitly modified to appear as such.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the steps of the staircase appear as segmented scales, forming a pattern consistent with reptilian skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steps in Image B are uniform marble slabs typically found on staircases. They lack textures indicative of segmented scales that would mimic reptilian skin. Staircase steps are designed for structural integrity and safety, differing greatly from the organic, textured pattern found in reptilian scales.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the railing been transformed into a spine-like structure with vertebrae or bone-like segments that follow the spiral path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railing is a continuous wooden element that displays typical architectural banister design rather than resembling a spine-like structure with individual vertebrae or bone segments. The design offers structural support and safety rather than an imitation of a biological framework.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible wooden patterns or textures resembling a skeletal framework integrated into the serpent's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The railing in Image B is constructed from wood, displaying natural wood grain patterns typical of wooden architecture rather than resembling a skeletal framework. World knowledge indicates that banisters are crafted for aesthetic and strength purposes and do not mimic skeletal forms unless designed with such intent, which is not evident here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there stone-like ridges or raised, rocky textures running along the body of the serpent creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The staircase steps in Image B are smooth marble, commonly used in construction for its durability and elegance. There are no raised or rocky textures, resembling natural stone ridges that would suggest a transformation into a serpent creature. The structure remains architectural rather than organic or reptilian.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the spirals of the staircase rendered as graceful, continuous coils resembling those of a serpent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a spiral staircase with a continuous curvature typical of its architectural form, with a flowing design resembling the coils of a serpent due to its spiral nature. Spiral staircases naturally have an elegant, continuous form akin to the coils in a snake-like structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the serpent creature exhibit visual traits suggesting antiquity and natural grandeur (such as weathered textures, earthy colors, or organic forms)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the staircase is constructed with marble and wood, displaying architectural beauty and elegance consistent with modern or historically preserved structures. It lacks weathered textures, earthy colors, or organic forms indicative of a serpent creature embodying antiquity and natural grandeur.",
