      "question": "Is there a ketchup bottle positioned in the lower-right corner of the image, angled slightly toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed an object in the lower-right corner that visually resembles a ketchup bottle due to its shape and color. The bottle is red, with a nozzle typical of ketchup bottles. Its positioning and angle suggest it is oriented slightly towards the center of the image. This deduction is based on the common design and presentation of ketchup bottles and their orientation in promotional images.",

      "question": "Is the text “The king of flavors” displayed in the middle of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'The king of flavors' is prominently displayed around the center of the image. This conclusion is drawn from the positioning of the text and its alignment in the image, where it serves as the visual focal point among surrounding elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text “The king of flavors” crafted in a glossy, ketchup-style script font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B has an appearance that mimics the glossy, slick look often associated with ketchup and similar sauces. The script-style font and red color further suggest that the design intends to convey the appearance of ketchup. This reasoning relies on common design techniques used in food advertising, where words are styled to resemble the product they represent.",

      "question": "Do the letters of “The king of flavors” appear to hover in the air and subtly mingle with the mist of the forest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text does indeed seem to be positioned above the forest background, giving the illusion of hovering. The misty setting of the forest enhances the perception of the text subtly intertwining with the mist, a technique often used to create a mystical or ethereal atmosphere. This conclusion is based on the visual blend between the text effects and the foggy surroundings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there streams of ketchup visually linking back to the opened bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict streams of ketchup flowing back to the bottle. The bottle is shown but there is no additional visual indication of ketchup streams connecting the text or other elements back to the bottle. Without such visible trails, it's reasonable to conclude that this effect is absent in the image.",
