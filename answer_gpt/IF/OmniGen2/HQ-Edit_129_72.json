      "question": "Are there visible flames gently flickering from the wingtips and tail of the bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird has been transformed into a phoenix-like creature with flames emanating from the wingtips. These flames are depicted as bright orange and yellow shapes that resemble fire, which is a characteristic often associated with mythical birds like the phoenix. The visual depiction of these fiery elements, combined with knowledge of phoenix representations in art and mythology, supports the conclusion that there are indeed flames flickering from the wingtips and tail.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the bird's plumage been replaced with iridescent, shimmering scales instead of solid red feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird retains a feathered appearance, although it is stylized with some artistic embellishments. The body of the bird is adorned with flame-like patterns, but these do not translate to iridescent scales. The depiction reflects artistic creativity rather than a transformation to scales, which are typically represented with a distinct texture different from that of feathers.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there distinct fiery patterns (such as flame-like designs or glowing lines) visible across the bird's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B features stylized flame-like patterns visible on its body. These patterns are designed to resemble fire, with bright gradients of red, orange, and yellow mimicking the appearance of flames. Such patterns are consistent with common depictions of phoenixes, which are often illustrated with fiery details to highlight their mythical associations with fire.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bird's eyes appear as glowing embers with a warm, luminous glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's eyes are depicted with a bright, warm color that suggests luminance, resembling embers or small flames. This depiction aligns with artistic representations of mythical creatures, where luminous eyes are often used to impart a sense of mysticism and other-worldliness.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the branch now made of twisted, dark, glossy obsidian material instead of natural wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branch in Image B still appears to be made of natural wood, covered in a thin layer of snow, much like in Image A. There is no indication of a transformation into a twisted, dark, glossy obsidian material, which would typically entail a more reflective and polished surface with darker tones.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blossoms in Image B retain their floral appearance, with no depiction of flames or burning. They remain vibrant and colorful, similar to cherry blossoms or plum blossoms in spring, and do not exhibit qualities typical of burning objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the burning elements (flames, glowing parts) clearly visible in contrast to the falling snowflakes in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flames and glowing parts on the bird are vividly depicted in Image B, with bright hues of yellow and orange providing a stark contrast to the soft, white snowflakes in the background. This contrast emphasizes the burning elements, making them stand out against the cooler and muted tones of the snow-filled backdrop.",
