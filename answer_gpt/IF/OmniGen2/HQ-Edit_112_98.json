      "question": "Has the sparrow been transformed into an ethereal blossom spirit with a non-realistic, floral appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bird features an exaggerated ethereal design with bright pink feathers and green glowing eyes, which is not typical of real birds, and gives it a surreal, fantasy-like appearance reminiscent of a blossom spirit. By comparison, Image A depicts a realistic sparrow with natural bird colors and details, confirming that the bird in Image B is indeed transformed into a non-realistic, floral representation.",

      "question": "Are the bird's feathers replaced with petal-like structures that have a soft pink gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feathers appear to be rendered in a stylized manner with petal-like shapes, featuring soft pink hues that resemble the appearance of flower petals. Image A shows typical sparrow feathers with brown and white coloration, underlining the transformation in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there distinct blossom patterns visible along the wings of the bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the wings do not present specific blossom patterns; they are uniformly pink without detailed floral designs. Image A exhibits normal feather patterning typical of a sparrow. Therefore, the edited image does not incorporate distinct blossom patterns on the wings.",

      "question": "Do the bird's eyes appear as glowing emerald-green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird features eyes that are bright emerald-green and appear to have an inner glow effect, giving a fantastical and mystical impression. This contrasts with Image A, where the sparrow's eyes are naturally dark, realistic, and do not glow.",

      "question": "Has the tail been replaced with cascading cherry blossoms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a tail that is similar to a regular bird's tail structure, though stylized with pink tones, rather than a replacement with cascading cherry blossoms. Image A's tail also reflects typical bird anatomy, indicating no transformation into cherry blossoms in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, there are no vines wrapped around the bird's legs; the legs appear normal and unobstructed. Image A concurs, with legs free from any vine-like structures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not reveal any sparkling dewdrop ornaments on the bird's chest; its pink feathers appear solid without embellishments akin to dew. Image A reflects a usual sparrow chest with a natural feather texture, suggesting no added ornaments in the edited image.",
