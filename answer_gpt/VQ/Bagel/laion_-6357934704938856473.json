      "question": "Are the brushed metal and matte finishes applied consistently across the robot’s body without visible texture artifacts or inconsistent sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts a robot with surfaces that appear uniformly covered with a brushed metal finish. The finish is even and consistent, showing no signs of texture artifacts or sheen inconsistencies. The appearance of a brushed metal finish typically involves a uniform reflection and texture that does not show unexpected variations, and this is maintained throughout the robot's body.",

      "question": "Is the hexagonal box fully enclosed around the robot with clean edges, proper proportions, and a clearly legible \"MECHA VANGUARD\" label without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hexagonal box in the edited image appears to be neatly positioned around the robot with sharp, clean edges. The proportions are correct, matching the standard presentation of packaging. The text 'MECHA VANGUARD' is clear and legible, without any distortion or blurring, suggesting careful editing to maintain the integrity of the label and the packaging design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the engraved details on the armor plates and weapon surfaces clear and non-blurry, and do the joint areas (elbows, knees) show no signs of geometric distortion or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the robot with finely engraved details on its armor plates and weapons, which are clear and crisp without any blurring. The joints at the elbows and knees appear correctly modeled, displaying no geometric distortion or segments that appear missing, which indicates precise attention to detail in the editing process.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the cityscape background extend behind the robot without clipping through its limbs or body, and does it match the lighting direction and scale of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the cityscape background extends seamlessly behind the robot. There are no instances of the background clipping through any part of the robot's limbs or body. Additionally, the lighting direction from the background matches the lighting on the robot, and the scale complements the robot's size, ensuring the scene appears cohesive and integrated.",

      "question": "Are the robot’s limbs, weapons, and armor pieces correctly aligned and positioned without overlapping or floating elements that violate spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts the robot with limbs, weapons, and armor pieces that are well-aligned and consistently placed. There are no overlapping or floating elements; everything appears logically positioned and secured to the robot in a way that adheres to the principles of spatial logic.",
