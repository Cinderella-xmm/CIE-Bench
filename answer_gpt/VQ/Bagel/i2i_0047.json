      "question": "Does the transition between the train and the cyberpunk background appear seamless without obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the train is integrated into a futuristic cyberpunk setting, characterized by vibrant neon lights and a glossy environment. The transition between the train and the background does not show visible seams or harsh edges, which are typical signs of poor integration. The colors and lighting on the train seem to match the ambient glow from the cyberpunk setting, suggesting a thoughtful blend. Thus, the transition appears seamless without obvious artifacts or unnatural textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the reflections of neon lights on the train surface realistic and consistent with the expected behavior of light in a cyberpunk setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In a cyberpunk environment, neon lights would typically create vibrant and colorful reflections on surfaces. In the edited image, the reflections on the train mimic this expected behavior, displaying bright and colorful highlights that seem to correspond with the surrounding neon lights. The reflections appear to follow the contour of the train's surface realistically, contributing to a coherent visual effect consistent with cyberpunk aesthetics.",

      "question": "Do the added headphones on the driver look natural and do they preserve the driver's visibility without obscuring important features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added headphones in the edited image are designed to fit snugly over the head, a characteristic of modern headphone designs. These headphones are visible as high-tech devices, fitting the cyberpunk theme, and they are positioned such that they do not obscure the surrounding elements or important features. As the face is blurred, the focus is on the added accessory, and they look appropriate and fitting, without hindering the visibility of key visual elements.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the motion blur effect applied in a way that suggests movement without causing the train to appear distorted or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motion blur effect in the edited image is applied predominantly around the outline of the train, especially towards what can be interpreted as its direction of movement. This effect helps convey a sense of motion while preserving the integrity and details of the train's core structure and design. There is no significant distortion or loss of detail on the train itself, indicating a well-executed motion blur that suggests movement effectively.",

      "question": "Does the overall transformed image maintain a consistent edgy and cool style without introducing conflicting or out-of-place elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition of the edited image fits well within the cyberpunk genre â€” a theme known for its edgy and futuristic elements. Neon lights, glossy surfaces, and high-tech accessories like the headphones contribute to a coherent theme. The lighting, colors, and added elements align with the cyberpunk aesthetics, avoiding any conflicting visuals or out-of-place components. The style is consistently maintained across the image, supporting the intended mood.",
