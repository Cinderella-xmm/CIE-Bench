      "question": "Does the main body of the teapot appear as clear glass with visible internal reflections and refractions consistent with transparent material, without any opaque or metallic residue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot clearly appears as transparent glass, as demonstrated by the visible internal reflections and refractions that are typical in glass materials. There are no signs of any opaque sections or metallic residues that would be inconsistent with the transparency of glassware. The transparency allows light to pass through, creating a distinct visual effect characteristic of glass. Therefore, from these visual cues combined with common knowledge about glass properties, it is clear that the main body is indeed clear glass.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the glass surface uniformly frosted with no signs of smudging, uneven opacity, or artificial texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns visible on the surface exhibit a uniform frosted appearance. The opacity is consistent across all parts of the patterns, and there are no signs of smudging, uneven opacity, or unexpected artificial textures. This uniform frosting is indicative of quality glass engraving or etching, where the design is smoothly and evenly applied. Analyzing these aspects in conjunction with world knowledge about both artistic design and glass treatment helps in affirming the quality of the frosted pattern.",

      "question": "Do the handle and spout exhibit a consistent amber tint with smooth gradients and sharp boundaries, without color fringing or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle and spout in Image B are clearly defined with a consistent amber color that smoothly transitions in gradients. There appear to be sharp boundaries with the rest of the teapot, maintaining the clarity and integrity of the design. The absence of color fringing or unnatural highlights suggests a competent rendering of tinted glass. Through both visual observation and understanding of coloring techniques, it can be concluded that the amber tint is seamless and well-executed.",

      "question": "Is the reflection under the teapot symmetrical, sharp, and correctly aligned with the objectâ€™s base, showing accurate contours and transparency effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection underneath the teapot in Image B is distinctly sharp, symmetrical, and correctly aligned with the base of the teapot. The contours of the reflection match those of the teapot, and transparency effects give it a realistic glass reflection appearance. These observations align with common knowledge about optical reflections on smooth surfaces. By evaluating these elements, it is evident that the reflection is accurately represented.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the lid, spout, handle, and body preserved such that there are no stretched, compressed, or misaligned sections compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To answer this question, a comparison with Image A is necessary. Image A displays a metallic teapot with ornate engravings. In both images, the proportions of the lid, spout, handle, and body are preserved without noticeable distortions such as stretching or compressing. By examining the skeletal structure and comparing it with the original, it is apparent that the edited teapot maintains the same overall dimensions and alignment. Therefore, all components seem proportionally consistent between both images.",
