      "question": "Does the transition between the realistic baseball field and the chibi-themed environment appear smooth without any noticeable breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition from the realistic to the chibi-themed environment involves a glowing portal that serves as a boundary. While the portal creates a distinct separation between the two styles, the transition is artistically smooth, as the glowing effect blends seamlessly, maintaining a coherent visual appearance. There are no noticeable breaks or distortions between the two realms.",

      "question": "Are the textures and details of the baseball player's uniform preserved naturally in the chibi-style depiction without any loss or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi style inherently simplifies and exaggerates features, including textures and details. In Image B, the baseball player's uniform is represented in a simplified, stylized manner suitable for chibi art, rather than maintaining realistic textures and details. This is a characteristic of chibi art, which prioritizes cartoonish and cute designs over realism.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical rationality of the baseball player's body parts, such as arms and legs, remain consistent and credible in the chibi-style depiction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi art style typically exaggerates features, often resulting in disproportionate body parts. In Image B, the arms and legs of the baseball player are intentionally oversized compared to the body, which is a common characteristic of chibi art. Therefore, the proportions do not remain realistic or credible.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the glowing portal integrate naturally with the surrounding environment without introducing any unnatural artifacts or disrupting the overall visual appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing portal in Image B smoothly surrounds the baseball field and chibi-themed environment. The portal is visually coherent, with even lighting and a consistent glow effect that does not introduce any unnatural artifacts or disrupt the visual harmony. The integration is seamless within the style presented.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the depiction of the viewer's hand being drawn into the chibi baseball realm look authentic and plausible without any unnatural distortions or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of the viewer's hand in Image B is stylized to match the chibi theme, with proportions exaggerated for artistic effect. Within the context of chibi art, this exaggeration is intentional and expected. There are no distortions or inconsistencies that would render the depiction implausible within the chibi style.",
