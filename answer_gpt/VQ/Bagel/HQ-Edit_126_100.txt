    "Question": "Q1: Do the transformed columns resemble organic wooden legs with natural joint angles and proportional thickness, without visible distortion or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts transformed columns that look like wooden legs with organic shapes. They have natural curves, joint angles, and proportional thickness suggesting realism. These characteristics align with organic structures seen in nature and fantasy art. There is no visible distortion or geometry issues, making them convincingly realistic.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the roof area show a gradual transition from straw-like material to leafy branches with realistic leaf shapes, spacing, and lighting interaction, without jagged edges or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the roof smoothly transitions into branches with leaves. The leaf shapes, spacing, and interaction with light appear natural. The transition is fluid, without jagged line or odd textures, resembling organic growth seen in an imagined tree structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the satellite dish replaced by a large, detailed eye with a visible iris and pupil, positioned naturally on the side of the structure, without floating elements or mismatched shading?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a large eye in place of a satellite dish. The eye has distinct iris and pupil details, fitting naturally into the side of the structure. There are no signs of floating parts or shading inconsistencies, making the eye appear integrated and appropriately positioned.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the wall surfaces covered with detailed bark patterns showing natural cracks, ridges, and color gradients, without repeating textures or uniformity indicating artificial generation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wall surfaces exhibit bark textures with realistic cracks, ridges, and natural color variations, resembling the surface of a tree trunk. There is no uniform texture repetition that suggests artificial creation, and the visual cues align with genuine bark patterns.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the orange blossoms emit a faint, diffused glow that blends with ambient lighting, without sharp halos or unnatural brightness that separates them from the surrounding environment?",
    "explanation": "The orange blossoms in Image B generate a subtle glow that merges smoothly with the surrounding light. There are no prominent halos or overly bright elements that would make them stand out unnaturally, keeping them visually cohesive within the edited scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the vines emerge from multiple points on the structure, hang downward with natural curvature and density variation, and interact realistically with light and shadows?",
    "explanation": "Image B has vines extending from various locations on the structure, displaying natural hanging shapes and varying density. These vines are realistic in their light and shadow interaction, demonstrating believable behaviors that can be observed in natural vine growth.",
    "answer": "Yes"
