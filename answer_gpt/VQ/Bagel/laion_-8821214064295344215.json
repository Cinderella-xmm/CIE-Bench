      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the mosaic tiles uniformly distributed across the entire surface of both teddy bears, maintaining consistent size and alignment without visible gaps or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, shows two teddy bears composed of colorful mosaic tiles. Observing the surface closely, the tiles appear to be evenly distributed across the teddy bears' surfaces. The tiles are uniform in size, maintaining a consistent alignment throughout both figures, with no visible gaps or misalignment between them. This meticulous tiling technique results in a coherent and harmonious pattern across the entire body of the bears.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the yellow and turquoise tile patterns on the sweaters follow the original shape and contours of the garments without warping or breaking geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic tiles covering the sweaters exhibit a deliberate design where the yellow and turquoise tiles conform snugly to the original contours and shapes of the sweaters. This suggests a high degree of precision in tile placement, ensuring the geometric shapes of the tiles remain intact and unwarped. The efficient arrangement of these tiles ensures continuity across the original garmentâ€™s structure.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) clearly defined and proportionally correct using shaded tiles, without blurring or misalignment that compromises recognition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In this image, the facial features of the teddy bears, namely the eyes, nose, and mouth, are crafted using darker, strategically placed tiles that maintain clarity and correct proportions. The use of these shaded tiles enhances the definition of the features, delivering an unmistakable and recognizable facial expression without any signs of blurring or misalignment.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bows retain their original shape and appear with a smooth, reflective surface that contrasts naturally with the surrounding mosaic fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bows on the teddy bears display a consistent shape and are differentiated from the mosaic surface by a glossiness that suggests reflectivity. This smooth texture contrasts with the textured mosaic fur, allowing the bows to stand out distinctly while retaining their original bow-like appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the white pedestal fully grounded beneath the bears, with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does it maintain clean edges and uniform color without blending issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pedestal in Image B provides a solid base for the bears, with clean, sharp edges and a consistent white color, contributing to a stable and grounded appearance. There are no indications of gaps between the bears and the pedestal or any floating effect, and the pedestal's uniform color ensures it does not blend visually with the colorful mosaic bears.",
