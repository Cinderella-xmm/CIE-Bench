    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the golden plumage retain the original featherâ€™s elongated shape and striped pattern without visible warping or irregular edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden plumage shows a stylized feather design with vibrant colors and abstract patterns. While visually distinct from the traditional feather design in Image A, the elongated shape and suggestion of a patterned structure can still be discerned. There are no visible warping or irregular edges indicating a loss of the overall shape, thereby retaining a semblance to the original feature's structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the iridescent tips at the end of the feather smoothly blended with the golden plumage, showing no jagged edges or unnatural light leaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tips of the feather have a vivid iridescent quality that blends into the rest of the plumage. The visual transition does not show jagged edges or irregularities that could disrupt the flow of colors, thus demonstrating a consistent blending technique. This visual observation reflects an aesthetic choice that maintains the harmony between elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the ember-like orbs maintain spherical shape and uniform size, with swirling magma patterns that appear continuous and natural without broken lines or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orb elements in Image B are spherical and display uniform sizes, with swirling patterns that follow a natural flow. The colors within each orb are distinct, contributing to the thematic consistency without showing any color bleeding or broken lines that might result in a visual anomaly. The stylistic representation aligns with a coherent fire-themed design choice.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the phoenix claws correctly proportioned and shaped with natural joint angles, and does the flame they hold emit a soft, diffused glow without harsh outlines or unnatural brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phoenix claws present a stylized and exaggerated design. While abstract, they appear proportioned within the context of fantastical design conventions, with suitably flowing joint angles that contribute to the overall aesthetic. The flames surrounding the claws emit a diffused glow, consistent with typical representations of magical flames, avoiding harsh outlines or excessive brightness.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the newly added magical elements (plumage, embers, claws, flame) cast shadows and reflect light consistently with the ambient lighting of the wooden surface, avoiding floating or disconnected appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the magical elements such as plumage, embers, claws, and flames interact with the ambient wood texture in a manner that aligns with visual coherence. The lighting and shadows cast by these elements are plausible and consistent with their implied surfaces, providing a cohesive appearance that integrates well without indicating disconnection or floating.",
