      "question": "Does the cake’s icing display bold, graphic patterns that are evenly distributed and free from distorted textures or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake’s icing is characterized by similar bold red and white horizontal stripes that follow the shape of the cake without distortion. This graphic representation maintains consistency with bold, clear lines indicative of abstract or simplistic illustration styles. Common understanding of graphic design involves recognizable patterns that are typically free from distortion or irregularity unless intentionally styled. Image A has conventional textured icing typical in real-world settings, but Image B displays a consistent graphic style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the balloons represented as uniform monochrome dots that maintain their original spherical form and clustered grouping without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balloons appear as clearly defined spherical shapes with solid colors, maintaining a visual symmetry and consistency in their form. They remain grouped together as in Image A, reflecting a cartoonish interpretation that respects the spherical nature seen in typical balloon illustrations, avoiding any form of distortion. In contrast, Image A showcases balloons with different gradients and shadows that are typical in photographic representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the table and vase been converted into solid, contrasting color blocks with sharp, clean edges and no residual textures or blending artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the table and vase with solid contrasting colors, and the edges are sharp and well-defined, typical of abstract or flat design art styles. This style often eliminates textures to maintain clarity and focus through simple color blocks, which deviates sharply from Image A’s textures and blending that are characteristic of realistic depictions, where shadows and textures are present.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the candle flame feature exaggerated sharp lines and bright hues while remaining attached to the wick and showing an upward directional flow without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the candle flame is simplified and stylized as sharp and bright, maintaining the upward direction as seen with straightforward graphic forms. The connection to the wick is intact, suggesting correct alignment as per stylized renderings that still respect functional details of real-world objects. In Image A, the candle flame has gradients and a more organic form, consistent with photographed or lifelike graphic executions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all edited elements positioned consistently within the scene’s depth and perspective, with no floating or misplaced components relative to the table and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains visual consistency with perspective and positioning; all elements remain aligned and correctly positioned with respect to the table and background. There's a clear consistency in depth representation; objects have been remarkably transformed without losing their spatial orientation. This is in contrast to Image A's realistic depth portrayal, but the edited version retains proper placement without floating anomalies.",
