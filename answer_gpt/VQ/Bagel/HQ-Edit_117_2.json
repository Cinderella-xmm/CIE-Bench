      "question": "Do the embossed tribal patterns on the ceramic pots maintain consistent texture and depth with the original material, without visible artifacts such as floating lines or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceramic pots have tribal patterns with intricate designs. These patterns display consistent texture and depth, maintaining harmony with the three-dimensional form of the pots.

      "question": "Are the expanded motifs on the dress proportionally consistent with the garment’s structure, and do they avoid unnatural stretching or breaking of fabric lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's dress features expanded motifs that appear proportionally consistent with the structure of the garment. The designs flow naturally along the fabric contours, without any unnatural stretching or disruption of fabric lines, preserving the dress's aesthetic integrity.",

      "question": "Do the transformed bread and cucumber retain recognizable forms as food items while incorporating character features, without unnatural deformations or texture inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bread and cucumber have been transformed to incorporate character features, yet they maintain their recognizable forms as food items. The shapes are creatively altered to include faces but do not show unnatural deformations or inconsistencies in texture, thus retaining their identity as food.",

      "question": "Are the boundaries of each postcard vignette cleanly separated from the original image without cutting off elements or introducing edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the postcard vignettes are distinctly separated from each other and the original image by clean boundaries. The separation is precise, ensuring that no elements are cut off, and there are no visible edge artifacts, which suggests a well-executed layout.",

      "question": "Does the woman’s right hand (visible near the stove) have five fingers with natural proportions and positioning, and does it cast a shadow consistent with the light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's right hand, as seen near the stove, is not visible at all, making it impossible to assess the number of fingers, their proportions, or the shadow consistency. The evaluation cannot be completed in the absence of this visual information.",
