      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the body of the seahorse exhibit a consistent translucent pink glass appearance with visible subtle bubble textures, and are there no areas where the texture appears jagged, inconsistent, or artificially applied?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the seahorse is analyzed as having a glass-like appearance with a translucent quality, and it features a pink hue. The presence of subtle bubble textures is consistent with glass material, which commonly has these characteristics due to the way it is manufactured. Upon visual inspection, the body's texture appears even and consistent, without any jagged or artificially applied areas that might disrupt the smooth glass-like appearance. These observations lead to the conclusion that the seahorse's body is rendered with a consistent and appropriate glass texture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the yellow belly rendered as a smooth, opaque glass surface with a precisely etched music note inside a heart, and are the edges of the symbol clean without blurring or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the belly of the seahorse is assessed for its material and design. It appears as a smooth surface, suggesting a glass-like texture. The presence of a music note symbol inside a heart is checked for precision in rendering. The edges of this symbol are observed to be clean, without signs of blurring or deformation that would indicate poor quality or errors in the image editing process. This precision and clarity confirm that the yellow belly is rendered with care and attention to detail, maintaining the integrity of the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ribbons on the head and fins rendered as solid lavender glass with smooth surfaces and light reflections, and do they maintain their original shape without warping or appearing stretched or flattened?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ribbons on the head and fins of the seahorse in Image B are evaluated for their material and shape integrity. They appear as solid glass elements with a lavender tint, consistent with a glass-like translucence and reflective surfaces typically seen with glass materials. Their shapes are well-maintained without signs of distortion such as warping, stretching, or flattening that could detract from their intended solid form. This consistent appearance indicates a high-quality rendering process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the seahorse positioned on a flat, reflective black surface that shows clear mirror-like reflections of its base and lower body, and is the stand seamlessly integrated without gaps or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B positions the seahorse on a black base, which is examined for its reflectivity and integration. The surface reflects the seahorse's base and lower body in a mirror-like manner, indicating a high polish and consistent surface texture. The stand is integrated seamlessly with the seahorse, showing no gaps or signs of the seahorse appearing suspended unnaturally. These qualities suggest a coherent and realistic rendering of the seahorse's display, providing a foundation for a visually appealing and professional look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all elements—body, belly, fins, ribbons, and base—visually consistent in lighting, shadow, and material properties, with no mismatched highlights, color shifts, or artificial edges suggesting poor blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the different elements of the seahorse, including its body, belly, fins, ribbons, and base, are scrutinized for consistency in visual properties. Each element is inspected for uniform lighting, appropriate shadow placement, and matching material properties that align with the concept of a glass-like form. No mismatched highlights, unexpected color shifts, or artificial edges are evident, which might have indicated poor blending or inconsistent rendering. Consequently, the elements are visually harmonious and integrated, pointing to a well-executed image edit.",
