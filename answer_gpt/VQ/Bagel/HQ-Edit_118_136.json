      "question": "Does the metallic armor on the skater's torso and limbs maintain anatomical proportions and avoid unnatural bends or stretched shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic armor on the skater's torso and limbs follows the contours of the body, maintaining anatomical proportions with smooth curves and alignment that reflect a realistic fit. The armor design does not display any unnatural bends or exaggerated stretching that would distort the form and motion of the human figure. The joints and articulation points on the limbs are also consistent with normal human anatomy, which helps in preserving natural movement and shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hoverboardâ€™s transparent deck visually consistent in shape and structure, with no broken edges or misplaced glow effects that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hoverboard in Image B exhibits a smooth and uniform shape, with clear and consistent edges. The glow effects surrounding the hoverboard are well-integrated with its structure, enhancing its futuristic appearance without introducing digital artifacts such as broken edges or misplaced lights. The transparency and illumination are consistently applied, creating a polished and coherent look.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the graffiti elements on the ramps and walls rendered as animated digital displays rather than static paint, with smooth transitions and no pixelation or jagged outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B focuses on futuristic and vibrant elements, the graffiti in Image A (original image for comparison) is depicted as static paint with distinct outlines and textures. In Image B, the representation moves away from traditional graffiti, as it does not feature animated digital displays; the focus is on realistic depiction with smooth transitions and consistent outlines. The presented artwork in Image B does not show pixelation or jagged edges, indicative of high-quality rendering without animation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the neon highlights on the armor and hoverboard cast soft, consistent glows on nearby surfaces without creating harsh, unrealistic reflections or color bleed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neon highlights in Image B are designed to blend seamlessly with the environment, casting soft and uniform glows that accentuate the subject's futuristic look. These highlights create ambient luminescence that interacts evenly with surrounding surfaces, avoiding harsh reflections or excessive color bleed. The controlled glow enhances the image's realism and maintains visual harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the motion lines positioned along the trajectory of the skater and hoverboard, following natural flow without intersecting or overlapping key features like limbs or the board in an implausible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motion lines are strategically placed to emphasize the speed and direction of the skater and hoverboard. These lines follow a natural trajectory, enhancing the sense of movement without disrupting the composition of the figure or board. There are no intersecting or overlapping lines that compromise the clarity or realism of the image's action elements, ensuring a coherent depiction of motion.",
