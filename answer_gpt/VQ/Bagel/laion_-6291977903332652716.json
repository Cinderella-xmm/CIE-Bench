      "question": "Are the buildings and water surface inside the sphere free from unnatural bending or warping at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings and water surface are inside a spherical container (possibly a glass ball), where the optical distortion at the edges would be expected due to the curvature of the sphere. However, the visuals show that the structures and water inside the sphere maintain a consistent form without noticeable bending or warping at the edges. This suggests that care was taken to maintain the intended design within the confines of the sphere which indicates a high level of detail and editing skill. Therefore, there isn't any unnatural bending or warping at the edges.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wooden beams and stucco surfaces of the houses retain clear, natural textures without pixelation or repeating patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the wooden beams and stucco surfaces exhibits clarity in the textures. Despite being a miniature representation, the design of the structures does not show signs of pixelation or obvious repeating patterns typically associated with low-resolution images. The textures appear consistent and well-defined, maintaining an authentic representation in this miniature setting.",

      "question": "Does the water surface show smooth, continuous reflections of the buildings and sky without excessive glare or broken mirror-like effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the water surface inside the sphere presents reflections of the buildings. While there is an inherent complexity in modeling reflections, the water surface shows reflections that are smooth and continuous without pronounced glare or mirror-like breakage. This attention to detail in maintaining the reflection's consistency without breakage is evident.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the added mini bridges connected to both banks and do the plants grow from valid surfaces without appearing suspended in air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mini bridges are depicted such that they connect smoothly to both banks, ensuring a realistic connection within the miniature world. Additionally, the plants shown are growing out of surfaces that logically support plant growth, such as the ground or garden areas, rather than being shown suspended in air. This indicates careful consideration and craftsmanship in portraying a believable miniature environment.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all visible characters have five fingers per hand, natural limb proportions, and clothing that conforms to body shape without clipping or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible characters are tiny figurines, and while their hands are notably tiny, they appear visually consistent with having five fingers per hand. The arm and leg proportions seem proportional and plausible for miniature figurines, with clothing that appears properly conformed to the body shape with no obvious clipping or floating seen. This aligns with a well-crafted miniature representation.",
