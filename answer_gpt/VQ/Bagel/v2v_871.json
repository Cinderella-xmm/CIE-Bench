      "question": "Do the added LEGO minifigure and pear-inspired animal design appear naturally integrated into the scene without introducing any unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a LEGO minifigure next to a pear with a unique shape resembling an animal design, encapsulated in a glass cube. The visual cues show a clean integration within the scene. The colors and shadows match well with the lighting conditions, implying consistency with real-life objects. The texturing of the pear and LEGO figure, typical of their respective materials, doesn't exhibit any digital artifacts or textures that would suggest unnatural integration. The absence of visual discrepancies indicates skilled editing to ensure harmonious integration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the LEGO minifigure and pear-inspired animal design logically consistent with the size and scale of the pear and smartphone in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions and scales are crucial for maintaining logical consistency. The LEGO minifigure stands beside a pear of a logical size, occupied within the glass cube. Typically, a LEGO minifigure is significantly smaller than an actual pear, and Image B respects this size relationship accurately. Comparing with Image A, the smartphone depicted indicates size consistency as it matches the realistic choice of pear and LEGO minifigure resemblance in scale. Thus, proportions appear logical when juxtaposed with surrounding objects.",

      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the glass cube, matte black base, and nameplate retain their natural appearance and fine details without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the pear and LEGO minifigure displayed inside a glass cube with a black base. The glass appears clear and well-defined, allowing the contents to be seen without distortion, thus ensuring a natural appearance. The matte black base looks smooth, consistent with typical finishes, and refrains from showing any digital artifacts. The nameplate is neatly attached to the base, with legible text that maintains clarity, suggesting professional integration and processing of the textures without visible editing errors.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the placement of the LEGO minifigure, pear-inspired animal, and nameplate within the transparent glass cube create a visually coherent and plausible composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a composition within a glass cube where both the LEGO minifigure and the uniquely carved pear reside on the same base. Their arrangement is central, suggesting intentionality and aesthetic coherence. Given world knowledge of display setups, such objects would likely be placed centrally for aesthetic balance. The nameplate adds informational value without cluttering the view. The composition fits spatial norms, offering a plausible portrayal within the cube's dimensions.",

      "question": "Does the lighting and background color transition from a soft caramel shade to a gentle cream tone enhance the natural appearance and authenticity of the wooden surface and other elements in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background exhibits a gradient from caramel to cream shades, creating a warm ambiance that complements the wooden surface. Such a transition typically enhances a scene's depth and offers a natural contrast to display elements. This background manipulation makes the wooden surface's texture and other elements like the pear and Lego figure appear more authentic. World knowledge about lighting and color schemes indicates this would indeed make items appear warmer and more inviting.",
