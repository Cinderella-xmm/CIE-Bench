    "Question": "Q1: Does the curved glass dome have a smooth, seamless surface without visible seams, scratches, or unnatural distortions that disrupt the visual continuity of the scene?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the curved glass dome appears smooth without any visible seams or scratches. The surface maintains a consistent curve, typical of a glass dome used to encase decorative items. The dome's surface does not show any irregularities or distortions, which suggests careful craftsmanship and a seamless design, ensuring that it does not interfere with the visual display inside.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the sails exhibit layered, folded paper-like textures with consistent shadows and depth, without geometric distortions or flattened areas that deviate from their original shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sails of the ship exhibit a paper-like texture, with visible folds and layers that create a three-dimensional appearance. The shadows on the sails are consistent with their shape and positioning, enhancing the perception of depth. There are no noticeable geometric distortions or flattened areas, indicating that the texture and form have been maintained well.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the blue resin layer below the ship show consistent translucency, internal glow, and wave-like patterns without abrupt transitions or unnatural textures at the hull interface?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a blue resin layer beneath the ship that displays wave-like patterns consistent with water. The translucency and internal glow are uniform, enhancing the appearance of gentle waves. The transition between the resin layer and the ship's hull is smooth, without any abrupt changes or unnatural textures. This maintains a cohesive visual effect between the elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the seagulls connected by faint, straight wires that do not interfere with their natural flight positions or create visible mechanical supports?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, the seagulls appear to be suspended in natural flight positions. The supporting wires are faint and straight, not interfering with the birds' appearance or positioning. This subtle implementation ensures that the mechanical supports do not detract from the realism of the scene within the dome.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all elements (ship, sails, water, birds, sky) correctly positioned and scaled within the glass dome without clipping, overlapping, or misalignment that compromises structural coherence?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, all elements—the ship, sails, water, and birds—are correctly positioned within the confines of the glass dome. The scaling seems appropriate, and there are no signs of clipping or overlapping. Each component maintains its structural integrity and coherence within the scene, contributing to an aesthetically pleasing and balanced composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
