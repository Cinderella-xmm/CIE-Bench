    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed building retain consistent geometric proportions and smooth surface transitions, with no visible warping or broken edges in its armored body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the building is transformed into a robotic structure. Its proportions and smooth transitions are maintained, as seen by the clear lines and unbroken surfaces that make up its armored body. There are no visible warping or breaks observed in its construction, suggesting the transformation preserves geometric integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the stylized shoulder pads seamlessly integrated into the roofline, with clean, sharp edges and coherent patterns that do not appear stretched or fragmented?",
    "explanation": "The shoulder pads in Image B appear to be cleanly and sharply integrated into the roofline. Their appearance does not reveal any stretching or fragmentation, indicating a seamless integration into the design of the transformed structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the replaced traffic signs display clear holographic effects (e.g., soft glow, transparency) without causing light leaks or unnatural color shifts in adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the traffic signs are replaced with holographic effects. These signs exhibit a soft glow characteristic of conventional holograms and are placed visibly without causing color shifts or unnatural light leaks in adjacent areas, showing a controlled and accurate integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Do the robotic pedestrians have correctly proportioned limbs with five fingers per hand, and do their joints and body shapes follow geometric logic without unnatural bending or missing segments?",
    "explanation": "The robotic pedestrians in Image B do not display correctly proportioned limbs or fingers. Their design lacks detail, deviating from geometric logic such as having five fingers or anatomically natural joint placement, producing an unrealistic representation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are shadows cast by the robotic pedestrians and the transformed building consistent with the direction of sunlight from the top-left, and do they align naturally with surrounding objects?",
    "explanation": "The shadows cast in Image B appear to be consistent with the sunlight direction from the top-left, based on the shadows' alignment and direction relative to other objects in the scene, which indicates a natural and realistic shadow application.",
    "answer": "Yes"
