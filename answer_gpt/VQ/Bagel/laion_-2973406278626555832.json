      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the laboratory background in Panel 1 have consistent lighting and depth alignment with the foreground figure, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the laboratory background appears consistent with the lighting and depth of the foreground figure. The elements do not appear floating or disconnected due to the shadows and alignment that match the perspective of the entire scene. This cohesiveness is assured by observing the positioning and proportion of the background elements relative to the foreground figure, which reflect natural integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the vape device held in the hand at a natural angle and proportion, with no stretching, compression, or misalignment of fingers around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the vape device is shown held naturally in the hand. The angle and proportion appear realistic, with the fingers wrapped appropriately around the device. There are no visible signs of stretching, compression, or misalignment, indicating a natural grip.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the vape device in Panel 1 show clear glass transparency, smooth surface reflections, and accurate labeling without pixelation, blurring, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the vape device in Panel 1 of Image B, it lacks the characteristics of clear glass transparency and smooth surface reflections typically expected. The labeling and surface details seem to be slightly stylized or illustrated, not showing realistic product detailing due to the artistic style applied in the panel.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the internal components in Panel 2 shown with correct relative sizes and connections, such as the coil being positioned above the liquid and the airflow path following a continuous route without broken lines or impossible geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the internal components of the vape device are depicted with artistic interpretation rather than technical accuracy. The positioning of the coil and liquid within the illustration uses exaggerated proportions and imaginative connections that do not truly align with realistic mechanics, indicating artistic licensing rather than technical accuracy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the text bubbles and labels in both panels avoid overlapping critical facial or clothing features, and are they aligned with natural reading direction without clipping or misplacement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text bubbles and labels in Image B are placed with awareness of the panel design, avoiding overlaps with critical features in the scene. They are positioned to follow a natural reading direction. There are no visible signs of clipping or misplacement, ensuring readability.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the vape device have exactly five fingers with natural joint bends and no visible deformities, such as fused or elongated fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the hand holding the vape device is drawn with five fingers, and they are depicted with natural joint bends. There are no signs of deformities or unusual elongation, suggesting a realistic portrayal despite the cartoonish style.",

      "question": "Is there a clean boundary between the photographic figure and the illustrated panels, with no visible seams, double outlines, or color mismatches along the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a clean separation between photographic and illustrated elements through a deliberate boundary. The artistic style differs significantly, creating an intentional distinction, and there are no visible issues such as seams or mismatched colors along the edges.",
