    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the statue's body maintain anatomically accurate proportions and joint alignment, with no bent or elongated limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the visual cues, the statue exhibits natural human proportions, with well-defined muscle contours that align with common anatomical standards. The limbs appear proportionate and correctly aligned without visible elongation or bending that would suggest an unnatural construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gold motifs and patterns on the saree clearly visible as engraved details on the marble surface, with no loss of fine lines or texture degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold motifs from the saree are not visibly transferred onto the statue's surface. Typically, marble statues do not feature painted or engraved motifs unless explicitly designed that way, and in this image, the marble surface appears smooth without visible patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the statueâ€™s standing pose balanced and physically rational, with feet properly grounded and weight distributed naturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue exhibits a balanced pose, with the draped garment suggesting a natural flow. The feet appear grounded, and while statues often depict idealized forms of motion with seeming balance, the pose does not appear awkward or physically irrational.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the jewelry elements (necklace, earrings, bangles) seamlessly integrated into the marble surface as engraved or raised details, with no gaps or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the statue, the jewelry is depicted as part of the marble sculpture. They are integrated smoothly into the surface without appearing detached or floating. This often involves careful engraving that does not disrupt the marble consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the pedestal and surrounding palace hall environment visually coherent, with correct perspective, lighting, and architectural details matching Renaissance style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background depicts a richly detailed environment that suggests historical or classical elements reminiscent of Renaissance architecture. The lighting and perspective align with such a style, enhancing the visual coherence of the scene indicative of that period.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the marble texture consistent across the entire statue, with no visible stitching, color shifts, or texture breaks between body, saree, and jewelry areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue appears to have a consistent marble texture throughout, with no visible breaks or shifts in texture, which would break the artistic continuity expected in marble sculptures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do both hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural spacing and curvature, and no deformed or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands of the statue seem to be designed with careful attention to detail, each having five fingers. The fingers exhibit natural spacing and curvature, a common standard in detailed sculptures.",
