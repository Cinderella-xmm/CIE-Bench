      "question": "Are the black ink strokes used for the gentleman's hair natural and free from unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black ink strokes for the gentleman's hair appear smooth and consistent. The strokes maintain a fluid motion indicative of natural line work, avoiding any pixelation, blurring or jaggedness which would imply digital artifacts. The representation is clear and aligns well with traditional ink artwork, which typically focuses on smooth, clear lines.",

      "question": "Do the facial features and cravat depicted with grey washes maintain structural consistency and appear visually credible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grey washes employed for shading and defining facial features, as well as the cravat, suggest a clean and logical form with gradual transitions in tone. Such use of monochrome washes is characteristic of traditional ink drawings which focus on subtle gradations to convey depth, adding to the visual credibility of the features.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the antique white paper ground have a subtle texture that enhances the natural appearance without causing any visual distractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is portrayed with a speckled, stippled effect reminiscent of natural paper textures, which helps in providing a classic and tactile feel. This texture does not dominate the composition, staying subtle enough to avoid distraction and allowing the subject to remain the primary focus while enhancing the traditional aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the darker ink outlines representing the wooden frame coherent and do they avoid breaking the geometric shapes of the original frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, darker ink outlines that imply the wooden frame encapsulate the subject matter by forming an oval boundary. There is coherence maintained as the ink does not compromise or break the natural geometry, which is crucial to preserve the visual integrity and outline precision typical of such artwork.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition between the ink strokes of the hair, the grey washes of the facial features, and the background smooth and free from obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transitions from the dark ink strokes of the hair to the softer grey washes and finally to the background are executed with a smooth gradient. This indicates a deliberate blending technique often used in ink art to ensure individual elements of a portrait integrate seamlessly, preventing any hard lines or pixelization that could detract from the overall cohesion.",
