    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass dome surrounding the fairy have consistent transparency, smooth surface curvature, and realistic reflections without visible artifacts such as jagged edges or unnatural refractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome appears to be smoothly curved and transparent, allowing visibility of the fairy inside without impairments. The reflections and refractions seem natural, maintaining consistent quality throughout the surface without jagged edges or other visible artifacts. Based on common characteristics of glass, these aspects are executed convincingly in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the wooden base beneath the fairy rendered with realistic wood grain patterns, consistent shading, and no artificial or distorted surface features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base has clear and consistent wood grain patterns, which are typically seen in real wood surfaces. The shading follows the typical lighting and shadow patterns one would expect on a wooden surface, with no apparent artificial distortions or mistakes in texturing. These factors suggest the wood base is realistically rendered in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the butterfly wings' metallic surfaces evenly lit with subtle highlights and reflections, maintaining intact venation patterns and no visible texture repetition or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic surfaces of the wings display even lighting with thoughtful use of highlights that enhance the realistic appearance of metal. The venation patterns are intact, and the textures on the wings show no signs of repetition or distortion, adhering faithfully to the usual characteristics of such materials seen in high-quality renderings.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the fabric textures on the fairyâ€™s outfit appear detailed and continuous, with no abrupt transitions, blurring, or inconsistencies in thread patterns or material thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fairy's outfit fabric has detailed textures that maintain consistency in thread patterns, material thickness, and color. There are no abrupt transitions, blurring, or visible inconsistencies, ensuring an authentic representation of fabric materials.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the floating petals and leaves positioned at varying depths with soft edges and translucent qualities, showing no overlapping errors, sharpness mismatches, or unnatural placement relative to the fairy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The petals and leaves appear to have a translucent quality, with edges softly blended into their surroundings. Their placement is at varying depths around the fairy, avoiding overlapping errors or sharpness mismatches, creating a natural composition in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the blue gradient background smoothly transitioned without visible color bands, pixelation, or irregularities in tone distribution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B transitions smoothly across shades of blue. There are no visible color bands, pixelation, or irregularities, adhering to a continuous and harmonious gradient typical of well-rendered backgrounds.",
