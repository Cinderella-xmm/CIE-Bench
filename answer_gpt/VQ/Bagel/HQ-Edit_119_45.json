    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brass and copper textures on the headdress and face uniformly smooth and reflective, without visible noise, patchy areas, or abrupt transitions between adjacent segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the mechanical steampunk aesthetic utilizes copper and brass elements where they appear smooth and reflective, which are characteristic traits of polished metal textures. These elements show uniform texture without visible noise, providing a seamless integration with their surroundings. The visual continuity and quality of reflection suggest careful rendering and avoidance of abrupt transitions or patchiness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the vertical and horizontal stripes of the nemes headdress retain their original alignment and spacing, with no bending, stretching, or misalignment caused by the addition of mechanical parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not include the traditional nemes headdress. Instead, it has mechanical and gear elements that replace the headdress, so the comparison between Image A and Image B regarding stripe alignment isn't applicable. In the provided steampunk setting, the spacing and alignment of the original nemes stripes do not appear, thus making it impossible to assess bending or stretching.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the mechanical wings symmetrically placed on either side of the head or shoulders, with clean edges, defined joints, and emerald accents that do not appear floating or disconnected from the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical wings in the edited image feature a symmetrical placement around the head or shoulders. The edges appear clean, and joints are well-defined, characteristic of mechanical designs. The emerald accents are visibly integrated into the wings and the design, showing no signs of floating or disconnection from the structure, ensuring a coherent and deliberate placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the clockwork designs on the collar clearly defined and evenly spaced, with steam exhaust pipes attached at plausible locations and angles, and no overlapping or clipping with surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the mechanical design of the edited image, the clockwork elements on the collar are well-integrated and distinct, featuring even spacing. The steam exhaust pipes are placed logically in relation to these elements, with plausible angles contributing to the overall aesthetic without visual interference or overlapping, ensuring that each element maintains clear individuality within the composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the vapor emerging from the steam exhaust pipes translucent and softly diffused, with no sharp edges, pixelation, or unnatural clustering that suggests digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vapor emanating from the steam exhaust pipes in the image is depicted with a translucent and softly diffused appearance. This depiction avoids sharp edges or pixelation, indicating good digital rendering quality. The distribution of the vapor adds to the realism and does not exhibit unnatural patterns or clustering that would indicate digital artifacting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the eyes, nose, and mouth proportionally aligned and anatomically correct, with no warping, elongation, or asymmetry caused by the integration of gears or other mechanical elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face area is blurred and excluded from the assessment. Hence, this question regarding the proportional and anatomical correctness of facial features cannot be evaluated in the context of the given image.",
