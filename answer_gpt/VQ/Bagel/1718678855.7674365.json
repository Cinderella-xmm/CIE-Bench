      "question": "Does the top hat sit naturally on the capybara's head without distorting the head shape or causing visible seams or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara is wearing a top hat. The fit of the top hat on its head appears natural and well-integrated, as there are no visible seams or abrupt transitions between the hat and the capybara's fur. The hat sits in a balanced manner, respecting the general shape and dimensions of its head without any distortion or awkward angles.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the teacup held by the capybara’s front paws at a natural angle and scale, with no deformation or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara is holding a teacup with its front paws. The teacup's size appears proportionate to the size of the paws, and it is positioned at an angle that suggests the capybara is balancing it naturally. There is no indication of floating or deformation, making the interaction look believable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the suit worn by the capybara exhibit consistent fabric texture, natural draping, and appropriate seam lines that follow the animal’s body contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit on the capybara appears to follow the natural contours of its body. The texture of the fabric is consistent, with seams and folds distributed realistically across the surface of the garment. The draping looks appropriate and properly adjusted to the body shape of the capybara without notable distortions.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the monocle positioned properly over the capybara’s eye without overlapping fur unnaturally or showing rendering artifacts like ghosting or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The monocle in Image B is placed such that it seems to correspond with the capybara's eye position appropriately. It integrates smoothly with the surrounding fur, without any signs of misalignment or unrealistic overlap, ensuring there are no ghosting artifacts or visible rendering issues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the London riverscape background align with the lighting and time of day of the original scene, and do architectural elements like Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament appear proportionally correct and spatially coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features notable London landmarks like Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. These structures are depicted in a manner consistent with their iconic forms. The lighting appears to match the time of day, which seems to be late afternoon or early evening judging by the shadows and ambient light, creating a coherent and proportionally accurate depiction of the scene.",
