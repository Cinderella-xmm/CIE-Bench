      "question": "Do the LEGO blocks forming the bookshelf and books have a uniform, smooth plastic texture throughout, with no residual wood grain or mixed material appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is constructed using LEGO blocks, which are known to have a smooth and uniform plastic texture due to the nature of the material. Unlike a bookshelf made of wood that might exhibit a wood grain texture, LEGO blocks lack such features and do not present any mixed materials. Therefore, based on LEGO's characteristic appearance, the texture should be uniformly smooth plastic throughout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the LEGO blocks uniformly earthy-toned (e.g., browns, tans, dark reds) and consistent with the original bookshelfâ€™s color scheme, without any unexpected or jarring color deviations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO tower is composed of blocks that appear in earthy tones, including browns and tans. These align with the natural colors one might expect from a wooden bookshelf. No out-of-place, jarring color choices such as bright or neon colors are present, which might disrupt the earth-toned harmony. Thus, the colors are consistent with an earthy-toned theme.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the darker LEGO bricks used for carvings clearly aligned and shaped to replicate the original decorative patterns on the spines and shelf edges without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, LEGO blocks, by their nature, are simple in shape and only permit rudimentary construction methods. They lack the complexity necessary to replicate intricate carvings. Alignment can be precise, but the replication of delicate patterns in the manner of woodcarving is not feasible. Consequently, what might be an attempt at decorative alignments could not achieve an exact replica of the detailed patterns from Image A without deviation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the top of the LEGO tower taper smoothly and symmetrically from the base upward, without jagged edges, irregular steps, or disproportionate narrowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO tower is composed of blocks that exhibit a stepped appearance due to the modular nature of LEGO construction. These blocks create inherent jagged edges or steps as they transition upward, which contrasts with the smooth tapering found in a uniformly constructed object. The modularity of LEGO results in a non-symmetrical tapering with clear, visible steps, rather than a smooth taper.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background behind the LEGO tower completely plain and muted, with no traces of the original textured wallpaper or lighting artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the LEGO tower is plain and neutral, lacking any textures or patterns that might indicate a wallpaper like texture. There are no visible lighting artifacts that could suggest a deviation from a plain and muted backdrop. This simplicity in the backdrop aids in focusing on the LEGO structure itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all LEGO blocks aligned perfectly in rows and columns, with no gaps, overlaps, or floating pieces that disrupt the modular structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO tower, constructed from uniform blocks. These blocks are typically designed to connect snugly without gaps or overlaps, ensuring a solid structure. The structure appears well-aligned without irregularities, such as misaligned or floating pieces, thus maintaining the integrity of the modular layout.",
