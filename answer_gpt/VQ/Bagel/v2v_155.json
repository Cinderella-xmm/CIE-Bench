      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style representation of the golden car maintain its natural texture and details without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture and detail of the 3D chibi-style golden car in Image B appear smooth and appropriate for the style, reflecting realistic lighting and surface properties, indicating a correct representation of materials without introducing any artificial artifacts. Therefore, the image maintains natural texture and detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the 3D chibi-style golden car preserved, avoiding any distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions and physical structure of the golden car are appropriately maintained, with correct geometry and alignment. The car's shape does not exhibit distortion or broken geometry, fitting well within the chibi-style framing and maintaining logical physicality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style golden car retain its essential features and style, reflecting the overall sense of reality and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D chibi-style golden car retains essential features like its body shape, wheels, and overall design that align with realistic car models. The car reflects a natural appearance through its consistent style and realistic elements, suggesting a coherent sense of reality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the human hand grasping the edges of the frame appear natural with proper texture and detail, without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human hand displays natural textures and detail, including visible skin texture and realistic color, with no evident artificial artifacts. The positioning of the fingers and the grasping gesture align with typical hand movements, appearing realistic and well-integrated into the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition and layout of the human hand and the emerging 3D chibi-style golden car visually credible and structurally coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B is visually credible with the human hand holding a frame in which the 3D golden car appears. The hand's grasp and the floating effect of the car within the frame are coherent with physical logic, ensuring structural harmony between elements and conveying a believable and integrated scene.",
