      "question": "Does the horse's musculature display intricate detail and natural texture without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays an intricate depiction of a horse, akin to a Renaissance sculpture where muscles are exaggerated and highly defined for visual impact. The detailed musculature here is stylized rather than realistic, creating an artistic representation rather than natural anatomical accuracy. Thus, it features some unnatural artifacts as part of the artistic intention.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lighting effects on the horse and elephant consistent with a Renaissance-inspired style and do they enhance the anatomical features naturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B emphasizes the anatomical features of both the horse and elephant in a manner reminiscent of classic Renaissance art, where light and shadow are used to accentuate depth and form. The dramatic lighting complements the artistic style without disrupting the visual harmony, hence enhancing rather than detracting from the anatomical portrayal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the elephant's skin retain its natural texture and fine details without any visible degradation or unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's skin appears smooth and lacks the typical realism found in natural skin texture. The rendering prioritizes an aesthetic similar to sculptural art over a true-to-life representation, leading to a loss of fine details and some unnatural patterns in the design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical structure of the horse and elephant appear rational and consistent with their anatomical forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and B, Image B presents exaggerated proportions—in the style of classical sculptures—where both the horse and elephant are portrayed with heightened musculature. While the forms hold artistic credibility, they deviate from realistic proportions seen in natural anatomy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition of the horse standing on a platform above the elephant visually credible and structurally coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of the horse standing on a platform supported by an elephant in Image B is deliberately stylized, enhancing artistic aesthetics rather than structural realism. The concept mirrors fantastical or metaphorical art where visual elements are coherent within art's own logic but not possible in real-world physics.",
