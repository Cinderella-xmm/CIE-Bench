      "question": "Are the clock faces and architectural details of the tower clearly visible and structurally consistent despite the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock faces and key architectural elements like arches and spires are distinctly visible and well-defined, albeit in a simplified version typical of the cartoon style. The vibrant color scheme does not detract from structural recognition; thus, the cartoon style does not obscure these details. Compared to Image A, while simplifying doesn't represent the real photographs' integrity, the cartoon maintains the structural identity reliably, allowing for instant recognition.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the clock tower and surrounding elements retain their natural textures without any noticeable loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) transitions the scene into cartoon style characterized by smooth surfaces and bold colors, eliminating natural textures like age marks or stone granularity. This results in a loss of detail typical for realistic textures, displayed in Image A with the stone's nuanced texture and weathering effects. Accordingly, compared to Image A, the natural texture detail is not retained in the cartoon render.",

      "question": "Does the edited image avoid introducing any unnatural artifacts or distortions in the clock tower and its surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the simplification of features and abstraction in the cartoon style, Image B does not introduce any distortions or artifacts that seem out of place within this artistic form. The shapes maintain fidelity to the expected cartoon representation standards, including typical rounded car shapes and consistent tower geometry. When contrasted with Image A, while the style transition is dramatic, it remains intentionally coherent without distorting recognizable forms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the clock tower and its surroundings logically maintained in the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even under the cartoon abstraction, Image B maintains the relative size of the clock tower proportional to the cars and environment. The positioning within the roundabout and the alignment of other elements accurately reflect typical proportions, adhering logically to the expected relationships visible in Image A. Thus, the tower's dominant scaling and structure are preserved suitably well.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the clock tower and its surroundings remain intact and undistorted in the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering the cartoon rendition seen in Image B, the core geometric shapes like arches, cylindrical tower sections, and circular road retain their form without noticeable distortions. While stylized, they reflect accurate interpretations in a simplified manner, similar to their depiction in Image A where real forms serve as the basis for reducing shapes in the cartoon interpretation.",
