      "question": "Does the entire body of the gorilla exhibit consistent wood texture and shading, with no sudden color changes or patches that appear non-wood-like?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla is depicted as a wooden carving with a uniform wood texture and shading. The body displays a consistent and coherent appearance without any abrupt shifts in color or presence of non-wood-like patches. The wood texture is visually harmonious throughout the gorilla's body, simulating the look of a continuous carved sculpture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the engraved fur patterns on the gorilla's body varied in depth and direction, resembling natural wood grain rather than repetitive or synthetic lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The engraved patterns on the gorilla's body in Image B are crafted to resemble natural wood grain, featuring variations in depth and direction. These patterns are artistically created to mimic the complex, irregular forms found in natural wood, rather than using synthetic or repetitive lines.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arms and legs retain anatomically correct proportions and joint structures, with no flattened or unnaturally curved sections due to excessive smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms and legs of the gorilla in Image B maintain anatomically correct proportions, closely replicating the joint structures commonly observed in live gorillas. There is no evidence of flattening or unnatural curves from excessive smoothing in the carved depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of etched wood patterns with darker leaf shapes integrated into it, maintaining depth and layering without appearing flat or disjointed from the gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is crafted with wood patterns that include integrated darker shapes of leaves. This setup retains depth and layering, visually linking it with the gorilla, without appearing flat or detached from the entire composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scattered leaves in the background rendered in darker wood tones and placed in positions that suggest natural resting or embedding into the wooden surface, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves scattered in the background are rendered in darker wood tones. Their placement suggests a natural resting or embedding within the wooden surface which is consistent with not floating or overlapping incorrectly with other elements in the image.",
