      "question": "Do the clothing materials on both individuals display natural fabric textures consistent with denim and woven southwestern textiles, without visible artifacts or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing materials give the impression of denim and southwestern textiles, typical of the western theme. The textures are relatively consistent with natural fabric appearances. There's no evident pixelation or unnatural shading that would typically indicate poor editing. The denim has a distinct grain, and the woven fabric shows patterns akin to southwestern textiles, consistent with the intended stylistic appearance.",

      "question": "Are the cacti silhouettes and setting sun elements blended naturally into the wooden background without causing misalignment, unnatural shadows, or color inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cacti silhouettes and setting sun elements in Image B are designed to evoke a western desert scene. Upon examining these elements, they appear to be well-integrated with the background. There are no apparent misalignments or overlapping pixels which would clash with the wooden background. Shadows and colors transition seamlessly, maintaining harmony across the image.",

      "question": "Does the new band name text in the banner use a distressed font style that appears handcrafted and consistent with the western theme, without jagged edges or unnatural texture application?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The band name text in Image B employs a distressed font style that aligns with a handcrafted, western aesthetic. This style conventionally includes worn textures, lending an aged appearance to the typography. The font has been applied without visible jagged edges or erratic texture applications, making it consistent and appropriate for the theme.",

      "question": "Are any newly added cowboy boots or hats positioned with correct proportions and perspective relative to the individuals and background, without appearing distorted or detached from the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cowboy boots and hats are additional elements meant to enhance the western theme. They are added with attention to perspective and proportionality, fitting naturally with the individuals and the background. There is no apparent warping or distortion, suggesting the additions were carefully manipulated to appear part of the scene rather than separate elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a well-considered layout where the various added elements (texts, props, and background details) are arranged to create a cohesive scene. The components are placed with even spacing and alignments, ensuring visual balance. This organization avoids clutter, maintaining focus on the central theme while evenly distributing visual interest throughout the composition.",
