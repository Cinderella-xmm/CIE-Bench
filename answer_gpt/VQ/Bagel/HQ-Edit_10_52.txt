    "Question": "Q1: Does the woman's face and body maintain natural proportions without exaggerated or distorted features such as uneven eyes, misplaced limbs, or unnatural curvature?",
    "explanation": "Based on visual cues from Image B, the woman's body is depicted in a stylized, cartoonish manner, which is common in chibi or animated representations. Her body proportions are simplified and the style does not aim for realism. Instead, it conforms to a certain artistic style that includes larger heads and simplified body shapes. As such, within the context of the artistic style used in Image B, the proportions are consistent and intentional rather than exaggeratedly distorted or misplaced.",
