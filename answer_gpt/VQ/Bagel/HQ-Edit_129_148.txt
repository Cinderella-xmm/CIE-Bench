    "Question": "Q1: Is the figure proportionally scaled and positioned within the globe such that her body parts (especially limbs and head) maintain natural anatomical alignment and do not appear stretched or compressed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure within the globe maintains natural proportions and anatomical alignment. The arms, legs, and head are in realistic positions, without any indication of distortion or unusual scaling. This suggests an accurate and proportionate adaptation into the 3D model space, reflecting the figure's natural appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the intricate patterns on the dress and the braided hairstyle clearly visible and free from blurring, aliasing, or loss of fine detail after conversion to a 3D model?",
    "explanation": "The dress's intricate patterns in Image B are clearly visible, with fine details distinct and sharp, without signs of blurring or aliasing. The braided hairstyle is also well-represented, showcasing detailed texture and design. This indicates that the conversion to a 3D model has preserved the original fineness and intricacy of these elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the wall patterns inside the globe accurately reflect the colors and shapes of the dress's pattern without warping, misalignment, or color deviation?",
    "explanation": "There are no distinct patterns on the inner walls of the globe in Image B that correlate with the dress's patterns. The interior is primarily shaped by the globe itself, showing continents and oceans. Therefore, there can't be any issues of warping or color deviations since such patterns matching the dress are not present inside the globe.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the miniature roots beneath the figure arranged in a way that follows natural growth patterns and does not intersect or distort the figure’s legs or skirt?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature roots are depicted in a realistic and natural pattern. They emerge from the base and flow outwardly without intersecting or distorting the figure’s legs or skirt. The natural growth pattern is maintained, successfully integrating into the design without disrupting the figure’s form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the miniature animals positioned at ground level with proper shadowing and scale relative to the figure, and do they have natural textures and forms without visible artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature animals are positioned at ground level with regard to the globe's base. They are scaled appropriately relative to the figure, maintaining a natural size relation. The animals have realistic textures and forms, and there are no visible artifacts. Proper shadowing enhances the realism and integrates them well into the environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
