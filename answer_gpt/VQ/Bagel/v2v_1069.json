      "question": "Does the transition from the ceiling fan to the snow globe maintain structural coherence without any visible distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a snow globe with a miniature ceiling fan inside it. The fan’s structure, including the blades and central hub, appears consistent and coherent within the globe. There are no visible signs of distortion or strange textures that detract from the appearance. The visual elements and perspective look natural, as they are logically integrated into the snow globe scene.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the fan preserved within the snow globe's interior, avoiding any loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fan inside the snow globe in Image B retains its detailed design, as evidenced by the texture and color of the blades and the central mechanism. These elements are clearly visible and do not appear to be lost or muddled by the snow and surrounding miniature scene. The textures remain natural and consistent with the concept of a snow globe.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the exterior setting with soft lighting and a warm background complement the snow globe scene naturally, enhancing the overall realism and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B captures a snow globe with a warm background featuring soft lighting that creates a cozy ambiance. This lighting complements the wintery interior of the snow globe, enhancing the realism and integrating the elements harmoniously. The gentle light reflections on the snow globe’s surface contribute to the natural appearance of the scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the snow globe and its contents physically plausible, with no distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B maintains proportions consistent with a typical snow globe design, with a clear dome and a base. The contents, including the miniature fan and house, are proportionate within the globe, preserving their geometrical integrity without distortion. This structural coherence supports a plausible composite scene in keeping with the theme of a snow globe.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the light passing through the snow globe create delicate shimmering effects on nearby surfaces that appear authentic and do not disrupt the scene's overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting interaction with the snow globe, creating shimmering effects on surrounding surfaces, appears realistic and delicate. Reflections and glints from the snow globe align with how light would typically behave in such a scenario, ensuring that these effects enhance rather than disrupt the scene’s authenticity.",
