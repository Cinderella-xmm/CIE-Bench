      "question": "Do the bold outlines precisely trace the edges of the player, basketball, hoop, and court without overlapping or cutting into the underlying forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the bold outlines are indicative of comic-style illustrations. These outlines are typically used to enhance the contour of figures and objects. In this image, the outlines surround the player, basketball, hoop, and the court. Since the outlines serve to delineate shapes in comics, they are designed to trace edges and should not overlap or cut into the objects. The bold outlines are accurately positioned, which is characteristic of the comic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dynamic action lines positioned along the direction of motion and do they avoid intersecting solid objects like the player’s body or the basketball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The purpose of dynamic action lines in comic art is to suggest motion and direction. In Image B, these lines are strategically placed behind the player, emanating outward to imply direction rather than intersecting the player or the ball. They follow the anticipated path of the player’s movement, reinforcing the action depicted without crossing any solid objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red and orange hues applied consistently across the image without causing visible color bleeding, banding, or loss of detail in areas such as the jersey fabric, skin tone, or wooden floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses red and orange hues extensively to create a vibrant comic effect. These hues are applied uniformly across elements like the jersey and the court. There is a consistency in color application seen in the player’s jersey and skin, where detailing is maintained, and there is no evident color bleeding or banding which would affect the clarity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text overlay clearly legible, positioned outside the main subject area, and not covering any essential part of the player or basketball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is part of the comic's speech bubble, a common element in such illustrations. It is positioned in an area that does not interfere with the primary subjects, the player and basketball, thus making the text clearly legible and ensuring it does not cover any key part of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the comic panel border evenly drawn around the entire image, maintaining consistent thickness and not cropping any part of the player, hoop, or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The comic panel border in Image B surrounds the image neatly and is consistent in thickness. It encloses the scene without cropping critical aspects like the player, hoop, or elements of the background, which indicates that the borders are evenly drawn to keep the whole scene intact.",

      "question": "Does the hand holding the basketball have exactly five fingers, correctly proportioned and naturally curved around the ball, with no extra digits or unnatural gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the comic style of Image B, attention is given to anatomical features to ensure clarity and recognition, even with stylistic rendering. The player’s hand holding the basketball shows five fingers, which are well-proportioned and curved around the ball naturally, aligning with the typical depiction of hands in comic art.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basketball is depicted as a spherical shape with seam lines that are clear and part of the characteristic comic detail. There are no signs of flattening or distortion, which maintains the basketball's realistic proportion despite the stylization of the comic art.",
