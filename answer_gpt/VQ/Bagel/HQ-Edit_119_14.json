      "question": "Does the suit fabric display consistent texture and natural lighting without visible artifacts such as unnatural gloss or patchy areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit is depicted as having a smooth and consistent texture, often associated with higher-quality fabric in traditional suits.

      "question": "Is the top hat correctly scaled and positioned on the head, with the feather securely attached and casting a natural shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top hat appears proportionate to the head size and appropriately positioned. The feather is fixed to the hat securely, and given the image's lighting, it should cast a natural shadow, which adds realism.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower portion of the outfit is not visible, which makes it impossible to evaluate the trousers' drape and fit. Thus, an analysis based on the described appearance cannot be performed.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The high collar and cravat in Image B seem well-aligned with the figure's neck and chest area, contributing to a coherent appearance. There is no visual distortion or overlap with the skin, supporting a realistic depiction.",
