      "question": "Does the perfume bottle appear to be constructed from Lego bricks without any visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) depicts a perfume bottle entirely constructed from Lego bricks. The construction appears consistent with typical Lego brick assemblies, featuring distinct brick shapes and colors, and lacks visible textures or artifacts that wouldn't belong to Lego constructs. The top part of the bottle, the decorative and nozzle part, all look like Lego pieces, maintaining a blocky appearance typical of Lego designs.",

      "question": "Does the fabric background transformed into Lego bricks maintain a natural appearance without any obvious distortions or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the background, instead of fabric, is now a surface filled with a variety of Lego bricks. Since Image B represents a scene constructed entirely from Lego, it is expected that the background consists of different colored blocks arranged in a manner typical to Lego sets. The overall construct stays uniform with the nature of Lego bricks, and there are no distortions or unnatural transitions that would misalign with this context.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the perfume bottle and the fabric background preserved, avoiding any distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the perfume bottle as a Lego creation do not display any distorted geometric shapes. The bottle maintains its structural validity according to how Lego bricks can be assembled. The base, body, and top parts are logically consistent within the constraints of using rectangular and square Lego pieces. Similarly, the background constructed with Lego maintains a level surface typical of flat Lego assemblies.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the edited image, with the perfume bottle and fabric background made of Lego bricks, retain visual credibility and coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout and composition of Image B, where both the perfume bottle and fabric background are constructed from Lego bricks, is coherent within the Lego brick design theme. The image maintains visual credibility as the whole scene is harmonized through Lego's typical aesthetics â€” bright colors, blocky shapes, and assembled forms. There is a logical flow in how the objects are placed and how Lego bricks logically 'construct' both the main and background elements, keeping a comprehensive theme.",

      "question": "Are the fine details of the perfume bottle and the fabric background accurately represented in the Lego brick form without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the perfume bottle and fabric background in blocky Lego form, which intrinsically simplifies details due to the nature of Lego. Fine details like textures, gradients, and intricate shapes present in physical objects are inherently reduced when depicted with Lego because of the simplistic and uniform nature of the bricks. Therefore, while the Lego form lacks the nuanced details of the original objects, this is standard for Lego representations, thus such simplification should be expected.",
