    "Question": "Q1: Do the simplified human figures and the background tent maintain their structural coherence without introducing unnatural geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures and background have been transformed into simplified geometric shapes, representing a stylized and abstract art form. The tent in the background has clean, bold lines and colors, typical of minimalist design. This maintains structural coherence as the figures are abstracted consistently without awkward or unnatural shapes, adhering to the style's constraints.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the colors restricted only to blues, whites, and the man's green shirt, and do they appear natural without introducing any unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette is simplified to blues, whites, and the man's green portrayed in a harmonious and flat tonal range. This aligns with artistic abstraction where limited colors are used to highlight contrast and clarity. The absence of complex textures but a uniform application of colors fits the minimalistic art form and seems intentional rather than unnatural.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the text 'SKATE FOR ALL' integrate seamlessly into the upper cloudy sky region without disrupting the natural appearance of the clouds?",
    "explanation": "The design in Image B shows no presence of clouds but an entirely different background which is a flat color design. Thus, the text 'SKATE FOR ALL' is placed on a solid teal background and not on a cloudy sky. In this context of a poster style, it integrates without disrupting an absent cloud scene because of intentional design choices for clarity and artistic statement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the proportions of the human figures and skateboards maintained realistically, avoiding any distortion or unnatural scaling?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases an abstract interpretation of the scene from Image A. The human figures and skateboards are depicted in proportion relative to the minimalist art style, preserving major structural elements and proportions rather than precise real-world accuracy. Considering the artistic approach, proportions remain consistent within style norms, avoiding distortion beyond abstract depiction norms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the fine details of the skateboards and clothing been preserved without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on abstraction, and thus, details of the skateboards and clothing are stylized into basic shapes and colors. While the textures and details are not present, this is typical for the abstract art approach, which simplifies instead of detailing. There is no unnatural texture as the style purposefully opts for broad visual strokes over fine detailing.",
    "answer": "No"
