    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes, nose, and mouth aligned symmetrically and proportionally, with no distorted shapes such as stretched eyelids or misshapen lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image provided has a blurred face, making it impossible to analyze the symmetry and proportion of the facial features like the eyes, nose, and mouth. Therefore, without the ability to assess these features, the question cannot be adequately addressed.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the camera proportionally enlarged but still held securely by both hands without floating or unnatural grip angles, and do the metallic accents show consistent highlights and reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera is stylized in an illustrative format rather than photorealistic, which may affect the perception of size and grip. The hands appear to hold the camera appropriately without floating. The depiction of metallic accents with highlights and reflections aligns with the style, suggesting consistency within the artistic paradigm.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the background gradient blend seamlessly with the subject’s edges, with no visible haloing, sharp cutoffs, or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a gradient with clear delineation around the subject. The artistic style presents bold edges compared to the original realistic blend. This artistic choice does cause distinct transitions at the subject's edges instead of a seamless gradient blend seen in realistic portrayals.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the decorative border composed of clean, continuous camera motifs that do not intersect with the subject’s face or clothing, and are there no pixelated or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a decorative border with camera motifs that surround the subject without intersecting the face or clothing. The border maintains clean and continuous lines in keeping with the illustration style, without signs of pixelation or broken lines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are individual hair strands, denim stitching, and fabric folds clearly visible and undistorted, with no smoothing or blurring that removes detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of hair and clothing is stylized rather than detailed, losing individual hair strands, denim stitching, and precise fabric folds seen in photorealistic images. Instead, broader strokes are used that do not focus on these intricate details due to the illustrative nature.",
