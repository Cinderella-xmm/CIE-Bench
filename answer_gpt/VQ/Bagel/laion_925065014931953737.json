    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head of the character significantly larger than the body, with smooth, consistent scaling across facial features and neck, avoiding jagged edges or inconsistent proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a chibi style, which typically features a larger head in proportion to the body to create a cute and stylized aesthetic. The head is approximately double the size of the body, and the scaling of the neck and facial features appears smooth and consistent, with no visible jagged edges or disproportionate elements. This aligns well with common representations of chibi-style characters.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black outlines around the character's body and costume elements consistently thick, clean, and free of smudging or irregularities that suggest poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black outlines in Image B are bold and uniform, providing clear separation between different parts of the character, such as the arms, legs, cape, and body. They are neat and precise, showing no signs of smudging or aberrations that could indicate poor rendering, which is typical in clean cartoon or vector-style illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the \"S\" symbol on the chest clearly visible, using bright red and yellow colors with no blurring, color distortion, or loss of definition at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'S' symbol on the chest of the character in Image B stands out clearly with bright red and yellow hues. It is well-defined with sharp edges and no signs of blurring or distortion. This clear visibility is characteristic of cartoon-style illustrations where symbols and logos are often used as focal points.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the blue and red colors in the suit and cape uniformly vibrant and saturated, with no visible color banding, halos, or unnatural transitions between hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue and red colors on the character's suit and cape in Image B are uniformly vibrant and well-saturated, reflecting a consistent color scheme typical of animated or cartoon representations. There are no visible imperfections such as color banding, halos, or abrupt shifts that could indicate poor color handling.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands of the character have exactly five fingers each, with natural-looking shapes and spacing, and are the arms and legs proportionally shortened without broken joints or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's hands follow a simplified cartoon style, which often omits details. The hands appear stylized and simplified, not displaying the exact number of fingers typically found in realistic representations. The overall proportions of the arms and legs are stylized, fitting with the chibi look, but this choice sacrifices anatomical accuracy for stylistic expression.",
