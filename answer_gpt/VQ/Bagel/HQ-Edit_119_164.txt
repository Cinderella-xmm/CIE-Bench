    "Question": "Q1: Do the celestial sails replacing the elephant's ears maintain a consistent size and attachment point relative to the head, without warping or unnatural stretching of the surrounding skin?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's ears have been creatively replaced with celestial sails that resemble space imagery. These ears attach at the same point as natural ears would, without any noticeable warping or distortion in the base area where they meet the head. The size and attachment point are consistent and proportionate to the elephant's head, showing a coherent integration into the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the cosmic mist emanating from the tip of the trunk smoothly integrated into the scene without jagged edges, overlapping artifacts, or inconsistent opacity?",
    "explanation": "The cosmic mist, depicted as a swirling nebula-like formation, emerges from the elephant’s trunk and integrates smoothly with the rest of the scene. There are no visible jagged edges or artifacts, and the opacity is consistently managed, contributing to a seamless and natural appearance with the surrounding cosmic theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the planetary rings around the elephant's legs evenly spaced and aligned with the limb axes, without clipping into the leg surface or appearing misaligned due to perspective?",
    "explanation": "The planetary rings circling the elephant's legs in Image B are visualized to resemble features of outer space. However, each ring maintains an even spacing, lines up well with the axes of the legs, and does not exhibit any clipping issues or perspective misalignments. They are well-integrated and proportionately fitting with the contours of the legs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the luminescent star patterns on the elephant’s feet appear embedded within the foot surface rather than floating above it, with no haloing or color spill onto adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "In examining Image B, the star patterns on the elephant's feet appear to be a part of the skin's texture, blending seamlessly without appearing to float independently. Additionally, there is no observed halo effect or color bleed into surrounding regions, indicating a skillful merging of luminescent patterns into the skin.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the galaxy-patterned skin follow the natural folds and creases of the elephant’s body, maintaining consistent texture resolution and avoiding abrupt transitions or stretched patterns?",
    "explanation": "The galaxy pattern across the elephant's skin in Image B is applied smoothly, respecting the natural contours and folds of the elephant’s body. The texture resolution is consistent throughout, and there are no noticeable abrupt transitions or stretched or distorted patterns across different parts of the elephant, demonstrating a careful application of the cosmic texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
