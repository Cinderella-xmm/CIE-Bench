      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style character maintain natural proportions without introducing distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi-style character is designed to have exaggerated proportions typical of chibi designs, such as a larger head and smaller body. Despite these stylistic choices, the character's proportions appear consistent and intentional, without any unintended distortions or breakage in the geometric shapes. Chibi styles often incorporate such designs, making them look exaggerated but still harmonious. Thus, the proportions appear natural within the context of the chibi art style.",
