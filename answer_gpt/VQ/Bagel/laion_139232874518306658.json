      "question": "Do the enlarged shopping bags retain their original geometric shapes without distorted edges or broken polygons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shopping bags appear with vibrant and exaggerated geometric shapes reflecting abstract design elements. These shapes do not maintain the realism and proportionality found in Image A, as they are stylized with exaggerated colors and forms. Thus, the original geometric integrity of the bags is not preserved in Image B, showcasing broken polygons and distorted edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the velvety texture on the coat uniformly applied without unnatural shine or inconsistent surface details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B stylizes the coat with bold, flat colors typical of artistic abstraction, omitting the nuanced texture and realistic surface detailing evident in Image A. The coat in Image B lacks any detailed, velvety texture and presents a more uniform but unrealistic artistic interpretation, devoid of any natural shine or surface variations seen in velvet fabric.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glossy gloves visually consistent in shape and reflection, with no distorted finger joints or misplaced highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gloves have been abstracted into a more graphic representation, which lacks the finer detailing of reflections and contours that characterize glossy materials seen in Image A. The highlights and gloss appear as solid colors without appropriate reflection variations or detailed finger joints, resulting in a lack of visual consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the abstract retail symbols positioned around the subject without overlapping or intersecting with her body or shopping bags?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, abstract retail symbols are scattered around the subject in a way that appears clear of any direct overlap or intersection with the body or the shopping bags. These symbols are positioned more as surrounding decor, maintaining a spatial separation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the open panel for personal messages blend seamlessly into the background with matching lighting and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the open panel for personal messages resembles an abstract design and stands out against the colorful background rather than blending seamlessly. It contrasts with the creative setting, not integrating smoothly due to stylistic deviations in lighting and texture.",
