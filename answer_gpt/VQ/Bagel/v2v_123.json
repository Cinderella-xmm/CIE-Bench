      "question": "Are the edges of the chibi-style 3D models seamlessly integrated with the photorealistic background without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style characters are placed against a photorealistic background that features elements like palm trees and sand, suggesting a desert oasis setting. To determine if the integration is seamless, one would look for any mismatches where the models meet the background, such as visible lines or inconsistencies in lighting and shadows. The chibi models have clean edges without any noticeable artifacts or misalignment issues between the two styles, suggesting a seamless integration.",

      "question": "Does the glowing armor on the blonde-haired character exhibit natural light effects and detailed runes without unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi design typically features stylized elements. In Image B, the armor appears solid but with a simplified texture typical of chibi aesthetics. The runes are detailed considering the chibi scale, and the light effects seem more stylized rather than natural, which aligns with the chibi style. Unlike Image A's realistic depiction, Image B's design prioritizes simplicity. Considering these factors, the textures are stylized appropriately for its context.",

      "question": "Does the plain adventurer's clothing on the character holding the orb fit naturally on the chibi-style 3D model without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's clothing is designed to fit the chibi model proportions, which are typically exaggerated with larger heads and shorter bodies. The shirt and pants display a natural fit around the exaggerated proportions without any apparent distortion or misalignment. This fitting is consistent with chibi stylization.",

      "question": "Do the leather armor and floral crown on the archer appear authentic and structurally consistent with the chibi-style 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the archer's leather armor and floral crown are rendered to match the chibi model's simplified aesthetic. The leather armor maintains consistent proportion and texture appropriate to this style, while the floral crown, appearing as a simple band with flowers, fits naturally on the modelâ€™s head, maintaining authenticity within the chibi aesthetic.",

      "question": "Does the decorative border enhance the visual plausibility of the scene without disrupting its structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of a decorative border in Image B serves to frame the entire scene, adding to its visual appeal. The border fits within the stylized theme, providing a cohesive feel that enhances the scene rather than disrupting it. Its design complements the chibi figures and the background without clashing or introducing inconsistencies.",
