      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style bird maintain its natural appearance without any visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B is rendered in a chibi-style, which inherently alters its natural appearance, giving it a cuter and more simplified form. In this context, 'natural appearance' refers to the consistency of the texture and absence of visible artifacts within the chibi-style rather than anatomical accuracy. The bird displays smooth textures and there are no visible distortions or artifacts in this rendering style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style lemur retain its structural coherence and visual plausibility without any distortion or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lemur in Image B is depicted in a 3D chibi-style, which typically involves exaggerated and stylized features. Nevertheless, it's essential the model remains coherent, visually plausible, and free of distortions. The lemur maintains a smooth and coherent structure without any visible deformities or unnatural proportions, suited to the chosen chibi aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style characters' outfits and accessories appear authentic and natural without any loss of fine details or introduction of artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style simplifies the character designs, but they should still maintain consistency in the rendering quality and detail level. The outfits and accessories, including the timepiece and telescope, are rendered with clean lines and vivid colors typical of chibi figurines, without visible loss of detail or unwanted artifacts.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the arrangement of the scene elements, including the 3D chibi-style models, maintain visual credibility and structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cohesive scene where each element, from the bird to the lemur and characters, is arranged in a compositionally sensible way. The spatial arrangement is consistent, and the scene maintains balance and coherence within the stylized choice of a chibi rendering.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall image retain its natural appearance and detail level without any noticeable loss of details or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the shift to a chibi-style representation, Image B effectively maintains textural and detail integrity within this style. There are no noticeable losses of detail or introduction of glaring unnatural textures, as the elements are consistently and smoothly rendered.",
