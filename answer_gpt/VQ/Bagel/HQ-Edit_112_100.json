      "question": "Does the glass dome surrounding the eagle exhibit natural transparency, smooth curvature, and realistic light refraction without distorting the eagle or background clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B exhibits characteristics typical of a well-crafted glass dome, such as smooth curvature and transparency. The presence of light refraction is subtle and does not distort the eagle within the dome. The eagle and clouds are visible clearly through the glass, suggesting a realistic portrayal without distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the miniature clouds beneath the eagle’s wings three-dimensional, properly lit, and textured to match natural cloud formations without appearing artificial or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the miniature clouds with a three-dimensional appearance, as evidenced by the shading and contouring which mimic natural cloud formations. The clouds appear properly lit, with lighting consistent with the expected environment of the dome, avoiding an artificial look or misalignment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold leaf detail on the miniature clouds applied in a way that shows fine, reflective metallic texture without disrupting the cloud’s natural appearance or creating harsh highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict gold leaf on the clouds. Instead, the clouds maintain their soft, billowy texture and appearance, suitable within the diorama setting. The addition of any metallic detail would create harsh highlights and detract from their intended realistic representation. Therefore, no gold leaf detail disrupts their natural appearance.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the dark wood base have natural wood texture, proper polish finish, and clearly engraved text, and is it positioned stably beneath the dome without appearing disconnected or disproportionately sized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wood base is depicted with a realistic texture and polish that reflects natural wood craftsmanship. The engraving of the text 'Noble Sky Gurdiaiin' is clear, suggesting attention to detail. The base is proportionately sized and appears stably positioned beneath the dome, maintaining a cohesive and balanced structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brass compass roses evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and rendered with realistic metallic texture and scale relative to the dome and base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass compass roses on the wood base appear evenly spaced and correctly shaped, reflecting typical design symmetry. The metallic texture is realistic, suggesting attention to the material detail, while their scale in relation to the dome and base maintains a balanced aesthetics.",
