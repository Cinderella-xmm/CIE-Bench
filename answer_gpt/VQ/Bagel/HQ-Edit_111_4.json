    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the cactus arms show smooth, continuous segmentation without abrupt breaks or distorted joints, and do the glowing orbs at their ends appear naturally attached and aligned with the limb direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembles a mutant creature rather than a traditional cactus. Its numerous tentacle-like arms lead up to large glowing orbs. The arms appear segmented with abrupt transitions between the segments, and the glowing orbs morph into sharp points, which do not align smoothly with the arm direction. Hence, the object in image B exhibits distorted joints and breaks, making the attachment of the ends appear unnatural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the iridescent scales evenly distributed across the cactus surface, following the original rib pattern without visible seams, repetitive textures, or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the creature shows scales or textures that contrast with the ribbed pattern seen typically on a cactus in Image A. These scales appear unevenly distributed, with vivid color shifts suggesting an unnatural appearance rather than following a clear, organic rib structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the crystal spine rise vertically from the base of the cactus with consistent facets and internal clarity, maintaining alignment with the original trunk and showing no signs of digital clipping or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a crystalline structure rises from the center of the creature, somewhat replacing the expected trunk of a cactus. The crystal appears vertically oriented with consistent facets and clarity. It maintains alignment with the base, without visible artifacts such as digital clipping, demonstrating a smooth integration.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bioluminescent tendrils positioned along the cactusâ€™s surface in a coherent, organic pattern, with consistent thickness and spacing, and do they cast soft glows that match the ambient lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features many small tendril-like structures that project from the surface of the creature. These tendrils show a consistent thickness and spacing but don't match an organic pattern one might expect from a cactus. Each tendril supports a glowing orb, casting unique illuminations, but the glows do not particularly match ambient lighting as they seem more part of the creature itself.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the base of the transformed cactus fully grounded in the sand, casting a shadow that aligns with the light source and does not show floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of what might have been the cactus is integrated well with the sandy ground. The shadows cast by the creature, including its base limbs or tentacles, indicate contact with the ground and alignment with the light source. There is no visible floating or disconnected sections.",
