      "question": "Do the chibi-fied players maintain a natural appearance without introducing unnatural textures or artefacts that disrupt the scene's overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-fied players are cartoons and inherently have a different aesthetic than a realistic depiction. However, they are cleanly drawn with even color distribution and clear outlines, which avoids the appearance of pixelation or uneven textures that might disrupt visual authenticity. Cartoons are expected to have solid colors and defined outlines, which these characters do. Therefore, there are no unnatural textures or artifacts present that would undermine their visual integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the outfits and hairstyles of the chibi-fied players proportionally and physically rational, avoiding any distortion that conflicts with the natural appearance of the players?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In this image, chibi characters are inherently designed to have exaggerated features, such as oversized heads and simplified bodies. The outfits and hairstyles follow the common chibi stylistics and appear consistent with the intended design. They align well with the characters' proportions and style, without any apparent distortion that would conflict with the style or expectations for chibi representations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the act of the chibi-fied players holding tennis rackets and shaking hands seem structurally consistent and free from deformation, fitting naturally into the pastoral setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-fied players are depicted holding tennis rackets and shaking hands, a pose commonly used in cartoon depictions. Their arms and the rackets connect logically without awkward angles, and the handshake appears continuous without structural deformation. Although a pastoral setting is not visible in Image B, the chibi figures and their actions are appropriately represented.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the semi-transparent court logo in the background appear naturally integrated and does not introduce any visual distractions or distortions that detract from the sceneâ€™s authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the semi-transparent court logo is designed to be part of the chibi-themed image background. Its placement is uniform, surrounding the characters without overlapping essential details or creating distortion. The transparency seems balanced so that it complements the image rather than dominates it. Thus, it is integrated into the scene without appearing distracting or distorting the visual integrity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the inclusion of chibi-fied players with tennis rackets and the court logo maintain the image's compositional balance and visual plausibility, without disrupting the natural arrangement of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-fied players and the court logo in Image B collectively present a cartoon-themed scene, which corresponds well with the intended style of the image. The composition centers on the characters, whose size and placement are balanced within the image frame. The logo's surrounding presence supports the theme without overpowering the significance of the players. Thus, the composition remains balanced and visually plausible within a chibi-style context.",
