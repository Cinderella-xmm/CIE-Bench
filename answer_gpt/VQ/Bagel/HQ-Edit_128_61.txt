    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed tagine retain its original conical shape and base proportions, with no visible warping or deformation in the structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object has transformed into a jeweled, ornate cup rather than retaining its tagine shape. The original conical form and base proportions of a tagine have completely changed, which means the structure is no longer preserved.
