      "question": "Does the cat's head extend naturally out of the frame without any visible artifacts or unrealistic stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's head does extend out of the main body of the cat but it appears as if it is just like a regular photo frame composition without any unnatural extensions or noticeable distortions. The head seems to be in proportion with the body, with no visible artifacts or unrealistic stretching of features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the curled tongue depicted with natural texture and spatial depth, enhancing the illusion of it peeking out from the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's tongue has been edited to include additional curls, which appear unnatural. While the tongue does have some level of texture, its doubling effect looks artificial compared to the imagery conventionally seen in cats. This lack of natural appearance of the tongue affects the impression of spatial depth and realism.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadow on the cat's extended head and curled tongue consistent with the rest of the image, contributing to a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows on the cat's head and body remain consistent throughout, suggesting that the head fits naturally within the rest of the image's lighting scheme. However, the edited tongue does not fully align texturally and spatially with the rest of the image, potentially disrupting the consistency of lighting effects when focused upon. Yet overall, the main light source casts a uniform shadow across the cat's features.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cat's eyes, ears, and whiskers appear proportionate and undistorted, contributing to the visual plausibility of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes, ears, and whiskers of the cat appear to be proportionate relative to each other and the head of the cat. They maintain a realistic size and shape, with the position and angle of each feature making sense within the frame, supporting the visual plausibility despite edits elsewhere affecting the overall harmony.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cat's fur texture and color remain natural and unaltered, ensuring the visual authenticity of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's fur texture and color appear consistent with natural fur. There does not seem to be any evident manipulation or distortion in its texture, maintaining a realistic appearance. The changes have focused more on specific features such as the tongue, leaving the fur otherwise intact in terms of natural appearance.",
