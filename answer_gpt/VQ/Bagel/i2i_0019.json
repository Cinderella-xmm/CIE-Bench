      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine of the elephant retain the natural grass-eating pose without introducing unnatural distortions or deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figurine depicts the elephant in a playful and stylized manner, characteristic of chibi representations. This includes oversized features and a rounded body shape while maintaining the pose of the elephant eating grass. This artistic choice is typical in chibi art styles, where features are exaggerated, but the pose itself remains natural for a grass-eating depiction. Therefore, based on the visual cues and understanding of chibi design principles, the pose is retained without unnatural distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the elephant's skin in the figurine realistic, showing natural details without appearing overly smooth or artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine's skin texture appears stylized and smooth, which is consistent with typical chibi and cartoon representations. While it does not depict realistic skin textures, reflecting a deliberate artistic choice rather than a realism goal. Given this artistic context, the skin does appear somewhat artificial due to the smoothness. Therefore, considering the artistic intention, it does not achieve realistic texturing.",

      "question": "Does the base design mimic a muddy terrain naturally and complement the elephant figurine without creating visible gaps or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a base that replicates muddy terrain using a texture that appears consistent with the grass and terrain the elephant is standing on. The visual integration between the grass and the mud base looks smooth and continuous with no visible gaps or inconsistencies disrupting the design. So, it complements the figurine effectively, aligning with the theme of jungle terrain.",

      "question": "Is the transparent acrylic dome over the figurine clear and does it not cause distracting reflections or distortions on the figurine or the surrounding base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent dome is visually clear and appears to cover the figurine without causing distracting reflections or noticeable distortions that could detract from the scene's coherency. The dome itself allows clear visibility of the figurine without interfering with the visual perception of the base or elephant model. Thus, it serves its purpose effectively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there no noticeable artifacts, such as missing components or misplaced shadows, that disrupt the visual plausibility of the figurine scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene within the dome appears coherent and complete, with no evident artifacts such as missing parts or shadow discrepancies that might disrupt its visual plausibility. The elements, including the shadowing and components, are uniformly presented and do not create disruptions to the viewer's perception of the figurine scene. So, the scene inside the dome is visually plausible.",
