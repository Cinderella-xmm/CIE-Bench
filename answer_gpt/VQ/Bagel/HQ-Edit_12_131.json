      "question": "Are the moko tattoos on the warrior’s face, chest, arms, and back continuous and free from broken lines or pixelated textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moko tattoos on the warrior’s body appear visually as continuous lines without noticeable breaks or pixelation, indicating good digital rendering. Moko tattoos are traditionally intricate and should be assessed for clarity and continuity in design. The tattoos shown maintain this complexity and clarity.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flax fibers of the piupiu skirt and leg wraps display texture variations in length, thickness, and shading, which mimic the natural quality of flax fibers. These attributes ensure that the fibers appear realistic rather than artificially smooth or uniform.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior is posed with his limbs in a stance that appears anatomically consistent with a powerful posture. The joints align correctly, and the muscle tension visible is typical for such a stance, avoiding any exaggerated or unnatural bending.",
