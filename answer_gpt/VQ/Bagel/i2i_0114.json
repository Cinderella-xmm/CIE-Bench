      "question": "Does the modern man raising a glass appear naturally integrated into the scene without disrupting the structural coherence of the original table arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the modern man is sitting at the edge of the table, which is inconsistent with the traditional seating arrangement depicted in the original painting. The original artwork is a well-known religious scene, 'The Last Supper' by Leonardo da Vinci, which features a symmetrical arrangement of figures around the table. The introduction of a modern man in formal attire noticeably alters this traditional structure, creating a visual discrepancy that disrupts the coherence. His presence appears as an addition rather than a seamless integration.",

      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or artifacts visible around the modern man in formal attire that disrupt the natural appearance of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the modern man has a different texture and color consistency compared to the original figures in the painting. His sharp lines, distinct formal attire, and different shading stand out against the more muted and textured style indicative of da Vinci's fresco. This contrast creates visible artifacts where the modern element does not blend with the existing artwork. The edges around him may also introduce artifacts typically seen in digital edits.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the modern man in formal attire blend seamlessly with the artistic style of the original painting, maintaining consistent line work and shading without introducing visually incongruous elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The modern man's addition to the scene in Image B does not adhere to the Renaissance artistic style of 'The Last Supper.' The painting features soft, blended lines and shading that reflect the techniques of Leonardo da Vinci. In contrast, the modern man's attire has sharp lines and lacks the harmonious shading and tonal qualities of the original scene. This creates a visually incongruous element that disrupts the artistic cohesion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the addition of the modern man caused any distortion or damage to the geometric shapes of the table or surrounding characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The inclusion of the modern man sitting on the end of the table in Image B does not appear to physically distort or damage the geometric shapes of the table or the positions of the figures already seated. The table maintains its original structure, and the characters remain in their traditional positions as depicted in 'The Last Supper.' The modern man is simply an additive layer without structural alteration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the posture and action of the modern man, specifically him raising a glass, visually credible and consistent with the actions of others depicted in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The modern man's action of raising a glass in Image B stands out as anachronistic and inconsistent with the scene. 'The Last Supper' portrays a significant religious moment with figures engaged in introspective and solemn actions, fitting the narrative of the scene. The gesture of raising a glass in a celebratory or casual manner disrupts this thematic consistency, making it visually and contextually incongruent.",
