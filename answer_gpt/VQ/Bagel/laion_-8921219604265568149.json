    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cathedral façade maintain detailed textures and depth consistent with the original stone structure, or does it appear uniformly smooth and plastic-like due to the resin material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral façade appears smooth and lacks the intricate textures and depth that stone would typically exhibit. The overall appearance suggests a more plastic-like finish, which is consistent with the characteristics of resin material. This observation of the smooth, uniform surface of the façade indicates that it does not maintain the detailed textures of the original stone structure as seen in a real cathedral.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added miniature figures proportionally scaled and positioned so they appear naturally smaller than the cathedral and surrounding buildings without appearing stretched, flattened, or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature figures are depicted as much smaller than the cathedral and surrounding structures, giving an impression of proportional scaling relative to the setting. They fit naturally into the scene without appearing stretched or misaligned, maintaining the illusion of being scaled accurately within the diorama context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the miniature lamps emit soft, localized light that appears consistent with their size and placement, without creating unrealistic glows or illuminating areas that should remain in shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lamps in Image B project soft light that appears localized and appropriate for their size and placement within the small-scale scene. The lighting doesn’t create unnatural glows or illuminate areas excessively or that wouldn't naturally receive the light, fitting well with the miniature setup.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the display case fully integrated around the cathedral and square with clean, continuous edges and no intersecting or fragmented parts that disrupt the geometry of the original structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the display case surrounding the cathedral and figures exhibits clean and continuous edges. The integration appears complete, and no intersecting or disrupted parts are visible that would distort the geometry or continuity of the original structures within the scene, reflecting a careful design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the engraved plaque clearly visible, properly aligned, and styled with appropriate depth and lettering that matches the baroque aesthetic without appearing flat or digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The engraved plaque in Image B is well-defined, properly aligned beneath the miniature scene, and includes stylized lettering with depth and detail that align with a baroque aesthetic. The plaque's physical characteristics do not appear flat or digitally altered, suggesting an authentic integration into the display.",
