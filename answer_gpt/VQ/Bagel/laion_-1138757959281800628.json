    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the corners and edges of the hotel building preserved with consistent angles and proportions, and is there a clear transparent boundary (glass) enclosing the scene without warping or breaking the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature or artistic rendition of the building, which does not maintain realistic architectural angles and proportions due to its stylized appearance. The lines and edges are more exaggerated and curved, and there is no transparent boundary enclosing the scene. This stylization results in non-standard angles and proportions, making the structure appear warped compared to typical architectural design principles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the water layers in the pool show consistent transparency and refraction, allowing visibility of submerged objects and swimmers without jagged edges or color artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pool is portrayed in a stylized way, resembling a miniature or abstract version. The transparency and refraction of the water are not accurately depicted, as the pool seems more like an artistic representation rather than a realistic depiction with clear visibility of submerged objects and swimmers. The portrayal lacks natural transparency and the detail shows unconventional color artifacts.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the sunbathers on the lounge chairs have correctly proportioned limbs and recognizable clothing details, and do the nearby trees display natural leaf density and branching without pixelation or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B adopts a stylized, creative design where sunbathers and trees are portrayed in a manner that lacks realistic proportions and details. The limbs of sunbathers aren't accurately proportioned and recognizable clothing details are absent. Similarly, the trees don't exhibit natural leaf density or branching; instead, they reflect an artistic style where elements are simplified and exaggerated. The design choice leads to evident pixelation and texture repetition.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the greenery flowing from the rooftop follow a continuous, downward trajectory with realistic shadowing and attachment points, and does it blend naturally with the buildingâ€™s exterior without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the greenery flows down the building in an exaggerated manner, creating a vibrant, stylized look without realistic shadowing or natural attachment points. While visually engaging, it does not adhere to realistic physics of downward trajectory or blending with the building's exterior. There are apparent floating and clipping issues typical in such artistic renderings, emphasizing creative appeal over realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the beach accessories near the pool edge correctly sized and placed on solid ground, avoiding overlap with people or furniture, and do they have natural material textures (e.g., fabric, plastic)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the beach accessories near the pool are stylized and lack realistic sizing and placement. The placement appears arbitrary rather than natural, and textures do not replicate realistic materials accurately. Instead, they align with the miniature style of the scene, focused on artistic depiction rather than practical representation, leading to overlaps and blending with other elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the floating 3D clouds exhibit soft gradients and subtle shadows, hover above the building without intersecting its structure, and maintain consistent lighting with the rest of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floating 3D clouds in Image B are rendered in a stylized form with soft gradients and shadows, contributing to their visual separation from the building. They maintain consistent lighting relative to the scene, floating above without intersection with the building structure, supporting the artistic integrity of the scene while ensuring coherence in visual composition.",
