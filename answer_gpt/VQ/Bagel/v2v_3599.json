      "question": "Do the armored medieval knights maintain the same size proportions relative to the crib and wall as the original stuffed animals did?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armored figures are robot-like and positioned next to a crib and against a wall. The figures appear to be approximately the same size as the original stuffed animals seen in Image A, maintaining a similar spatial relationship with the crib and wall. This observation is confirmed by comparing the relative dimensions and positioning of objects in both images. Therefore, the proportions remain consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or color gradients where the knights' armor meets the floor or wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armored figures have shiny, metallic surfaces which seem to interact naturally with their surrounding environment. There are no noticeable abrupt or unnatural distinctions where the armor meets the floor or wall, suggesting that the textures and gradients of light and shadow are consistent and cohesive with the room's lighting conditions.",

    {

      "question": "Do the armored medieval knights cast realistic shadows consistent with the lighting in the room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the armored figures cast shadows onto the wall and floor. The shadows align with the direction of lighting as perceived from the highlights and shadows on the crib and other objects. The shadows' depth and intensity harmonize with the ambient lighting of the room, giving them a realistic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the knights positioned in a way that appears natural and plausible, as if they were sitting against the wall like the stuffed animals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armored figures are positioned similarly to the stuffed animals in Image A, appearing to sit with backs against the wall. Their form and orientation suggest a stable and plausible sitting posture that mirrors the original setup with the stuffed animals, maintaining coherence with the scene's arrangement.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the armor of the knights exhibit fine details and a level of detail that matches the rest of the image's clarity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor in Image B displays a high level of detail, with reflective surfaces and contours that are consistent with realistic metallic textures. The detail level is in harmony with the clarity observed in the rest of the image, including the crib and other ambient elements, ensuring an even quality throughout the scene.",
