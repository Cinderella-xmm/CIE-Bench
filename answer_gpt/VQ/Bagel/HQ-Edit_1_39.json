      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the patterned scales on the cactus body consistent in texture and color with the embroidery of the sombrero, and do they follow the natural curvature of the cactus without visible seams or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a character with a sombrero, but it's a creature with patterned scales resembling those you'd see on fictional creatures, not a cactus. These scales have a metallic texture and varied colors, including blues and golds, and do not resemble embroidery on the sombrero. Image A, in contrast, shows a cactus wearing a sombrero, and the embroidery and the organic texture of the cactus are distinct. There is no direct textural or color match between any physical elements of a cactus and the sombrero's embroidery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the stone-like base beneath the cactus have a natural rock texture, proper grounding on the wooden surface, and proportional size relative to the cactus, without appearing detached or unnaturally shaped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base underneath the character is a rocky texture, elevating it from the sandy surface, which appears consistent with natural rock formation. The character itself is not grounded on a wooden surface but on a sandy terrain. In Image A, the cactus sits on a wooden sill inside a clay pot, which is a very different setting and does not involve a rock texture.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the golden quills emerge naturally from the cactus ridges in a uniform, radial pattern, maintaining the original spine density and orientation without clumping, floating, or intersecting improperly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a character resembling a reptilian creature with golden quills radiating naturally from its back. The quills are dense and well-oriented, matching the characterâ€™s body design without clumping or improper intersections. In Image A, there are spines on a cactus, but they do not resemble quills and are sparse, unlike the dense coverage seen in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sandy aura smoothly integrated around the base of the cactus and stone feet, exhibiting soft gradients and particle flow consistent with wind dynamics, without sharp boundaries or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes an aura around the character with smooth gradients and a natural sandy texture that complements its placement on an elevated rock in a desert context. The integration of sandy elements matches expected wind dynamics without sharp boundaries or pixelation. Image A does not feature a sandy aura; rather, it's a cactus placed on a window sill in a pot against a desert background.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the topaz-colored eyes placed symmetrically and naturally on the upper portion of the cactus, with clear reflections and highlights that match the ambient lighting, without distorting surrounding spines or surface geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character possesses large blue topaz-colored eyes that are symmetrically placed on its head, the reflections and highlights appear consistent with ambient lighting. Image A does not show a cactus with eyes; rather, it illustrates a typical cactus with no facial features. Therefore, there are no distortions related to the spines or surface geometry from any eyes in Image A.",
