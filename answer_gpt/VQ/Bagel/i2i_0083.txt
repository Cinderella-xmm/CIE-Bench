    "Question": "Q1: Does the digital display screen appear to fit seamlessly within the rectangular frame previously occupied by the painting, maintaining the same proportions and alignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the digital display screen occupies the same wall space as the painting from Image A. The visual edge alignment and proportions appear consistent with the frame of the painting in Image A. The display fits the space neatly, suggesting the dimensions were precisely adjusted to match.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the texture and surface finish of the digital display screen consistent with the surrounding wall, ensuring it does not introduce any unnatural artifacts or discrepancies in material?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the digital display screen presents a clear, smooth surface typical of digital screens, contrasting with the matte texture of the wall. However, these types of screens typically do not match the wall texture but instead have a distinct electronic finish. Given the context and how screens look when mounted, this is expected and not necessarily inconsistent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are all the details around the digital display screen, such as the wall edges and the flooring, preserved without any visible distortion or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "The wall and floor in Image B maintain straight lines and consistent textures, with no visible distortions or artifacts around the display screen. This alignment suggests that the editing was handled precisely, maintaining the integrity of the surrounding elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the digital display screen preserve the balance and symmetry of the room, with the armchairs still appearing naturally aligned relative to the new display screen?",
    "explanation": "Image B retains symmetry in the room setup, with the armchairs placed on either side of the digital display. Despite the change from a painting to a display screen, the central positioning of the screen and the symmetry with the armchairs maintain the roomâ€™s balance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the shadows and light reflections cast by the digital display screen match those expected from a wall-mounted object, without creating unrealistic or conflicting lighting patterns?",
    "explanation": "Image B possesses consistent light patterns, with no conflicting shadows or reflections from the digital display screen. The lighting on the screen and the surrounding wall mirrors how light typically interacts with TV screens, suggesting realistic integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
