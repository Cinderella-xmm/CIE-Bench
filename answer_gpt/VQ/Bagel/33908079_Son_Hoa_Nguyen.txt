    "Question": "Q1: Are the hands enlarged but still anatomically correct with five fingers, natural joint positions, and no distorted shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the illustrated character are stylized and enlarged, as is common in cartoon or illustration styles. The stylistic choice typically simplifies details and might not depict detailed anatomical accuracy. The hands have broad, cartoonish fingers but appear to have five visible fingers. Due to the stylistic nature, they might lack the precise joint depiction seen in more realistic imagery. This describes an intentional artistic choice rather than an anatomical flaw.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the green tones in the tea field vibrant yet consistent with natural plant colors, showing smooth gradients without abrupt shifts or artificial-looking patches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tea fields are depicted using uniform green tones that represent an artistic interpretation of a landscape rather than a photorealistic one. The colors are vibrant and consistent across the field, common in illustrative and animated styles. This approach simplifies texture and uses large color blocks to suggest fields rather than intricate details seen in realistic images.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the gold foil effect on the sack’s logo appear as a smooth, reflective metallic layer without jagged edges, unnatural glare, or inconsistent lighting?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses a stylized design to depict the sack's logo, rather than an actual reflective metallic finish. The illustration might suggest a metallic look through color choices, such as gold and yellow shades, but it doesn't aim to mimic real metallic textures; thus, it lacks reflections or jagged edges. This reflects a common choice in illustrations where detailed textures are stylized.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the vine-patterned borders present along the edges of the image, following natural leaf and stem structures without overlapping or clipping into the main scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the borders feature a vine pattern that is clearly separated from the main illustration scene. The vine design runs along the edge, which does not interfere with the central illustration, maintaining a clean boundary. The vines have a consistent, decorative design that doesn't intrude on the main content, indicating careful layout planning.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the recycled paper texture applied uniformly across the entire image without obscuring fine details such as the worker’s hair, clothing folds, or tea leaves?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the recycled paper texture provides a background base. However, the illustrative style does not indicate any texture that would obscure finer details. The lines and colors in an illustration are generally simplified, making it unlikely that any texture would overshadow details such as hair or clothing folds, given the nature of this art style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
