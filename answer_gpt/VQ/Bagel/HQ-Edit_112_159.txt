    "Question": "Q1: Is the glass display case surrounding the car and road clearly defined with smooth edges, proper transparency, and no floating or misaligned sections?",
    "explanation": "The glass display case in Image B shows smooth edges which are typical for modern display cases, and the transparency appears consistent, allowing the view of the contents inside without any distortion. There are no visible floating sections or misalignments, which suggests careful construction typical of high-quality display settings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the car’s surface exhibit consistent metallic red coloring with smooth gradient transitions and preserved sharp detail lines along the body panels?",
    "explanation": "The car in Image B has a metallic red surface that is uniform in color and shows smooth gradient transitions across the curves of the vehicle. The detail lines on the body panels are sharp and well-defined, as expected in a miniature scale model that focuses on precision.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the resin layers in the road and cliff areas visibly distinct with gradual transparency and depth cues, avoiding flat or uniformly colored sections?",
    "explanation": "The resin layers in the road and cliff sections in Image B are designed to offer depth, which is reflected through gradual transparency and variations in color tone. This avoids creating a flat look and instead achieves a realistic appearance that mimics real-world terrain.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the micro gravel texture evenly distributed across the road and cliff surfaces, with natural variation in size and no repetitive or artificial patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the micro gravel texture is scattered across the road and cliff surfaces, demonstrating natural variation in grain size and distribution. There is no indication of repetitive patterns which would suggest artificiality, conveying a realistic feel typical of miniature designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the sunset sky panel blend smoothly with the original sky, maintaining consistent color gradients and horizon alignment without visible seams or clipping?",
    "explanation": "The sunset sky panel in Image B seamlessly integrates with the rest of the scene. The color gradients are smooth and harmonious, ensuring the horizon aligns well without irregular seams, which reflects careful curation of the scenic backdrop—a hallmark of well-crafted dioramas.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the proportions of the car, road, cliffs, and display case consistent with a miniature scale, avoiding exaggerated or unrealistic sizing relationships?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases elements—the car, road, cliffs, and display case—in proportions that align with what is expected in a miniature scale model. The sizing relationships appear realistic and are not exaggerated, which is typical of well-scaled dioramas.",
    "answer": "Yes"
