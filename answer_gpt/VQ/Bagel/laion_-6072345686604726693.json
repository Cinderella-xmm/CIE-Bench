      "question": "Do the metallic wing structures exhibit uniform reflective properties and smooth surface transitions without visible seams or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic wing structures display varying reflective properties across their surfaces, indicating non-uniformity. There are abrupt changes in texture and reflection, suggesting possible visible seams or texture repetition. The reasoning is based on how light interacts with metals in real-world scenarios, where uniformity is essential for smooth reflections. In comparison, Image A does not contain such metallic elements to assess.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leg-like structures derived from the minarets proportionally consistent with the rest of the structure and do they show natural curvature and joint-like articulation without stretching or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leg-like structures seem to be of a different scale than the minarets from which they are derived. They exhibit an artificial curvature and do not display any natural joint articulation, suggesting instances of stretching or warping. The understanding draws upon architectural norms where proportional and structural consistency is fundamental for stability and aesthetics. As Image A simply contains traditional minarets, no such adaptation issues exist there.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the central jewel reflect light and cosmic patterns in a way that matches the direction of sunlight and surrounding environment, without appearing to float or casting inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central jewel in Image B reflects cosmic patterns that do not align with the lighting and environment encompassed in the image. The jewel appears to be superimposed rather than being an integrated structure that properly casts shadows in line with the sunlight direction and environmental consistency. Comparative analysis with Image A doesn't apply here as this jewel doesn't exist originally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing patterns confined to surface-level details, following architectural lines, and do they emit light that blends with ambient illumination without creating harsh glows or obscuring textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has glowing patterns that do not adhere to structural lines or continue in a manner consistent with surface-level details; they appear to override architectural textures and create distracting highlights inconsistent with the general ambiance. This contrasts with the original architecture in Image A which maintains uniformity in material presentation and lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, blurring, or color discontinuities at the junctions between the original building and the transformed elements such as wings, legs, or jewel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are noticeable seams and color discrepancies at the junctions where the transformed elements meet the original architectural structure. This suggests a lack of visual coherence and integration between the original and edited elements. Image A does not present the need for such junction analysis since it contains only continuous traditional architecture.",
