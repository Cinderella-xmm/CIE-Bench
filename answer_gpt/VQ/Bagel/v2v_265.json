      "question": "Does the cartoon locomotive maintain the structural coherence of the original train without introducing broken or distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blurred face, the cartoon locomotive maintains a coherent structure. The basic components of a locomotive such as the outer frame, wheels, and rail tracks are shown without any signs of distortion or broken shapes. The cartoon representation in Image B follows the typical clean and simplified design often seen in chibi-style artwork, preserving structural integrity.",

      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style cartoon locomotive harmonize well with the slightly stylized yet semi-realistic countryside background without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the locomotive is rendered in a playful and simplified chibi-style which typically complements colorful and stylized settings. The locomotive's wooden texture and shape blend seamlessly with the bright flowers and rolling hills in the countryside background. The color palette and style choices create a cohesive visual theme that avoids making the locomotive seem out of place.",

      "question": "Are the textures and details of the 3D chibi-style cartoon locomotive natural and free from any obvious artifacts or unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a cartoon locomotive characterized by smooth, clean surfaces and simplified details typical of 3D chibi-style illustrations. There are no visible artifacts such as pixelation or irregular patterns. The locomotive is rendered with consistent wooden textures, reinforcing a natural and appropriate look for its stylization.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the rolling green hills, bright blue sky, and colorful flowers in the background appear visually plausible and consistent with the semi-realistic environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B contains rolling hills, a bright blue sky, and colorful flowers, all of which align with the slightly stylized yet semi-realistic approach. The elements are vibrant and evenly distributed, and the simple shapes and bright colors are consistent with cartoon-style environments, making the scene visually plausible.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the edited image, including the 3D chibi-style cartoon locomotive and the new countryside background, look authentic and free from any obvious inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall composition is thoughtfully designed. The chibi-style locomotive and the stylized countryside background share a harmonized color scheme and artistic style, creating an authentic looking scene. Both the locomotive and environment maintain consistent textures and patterns, avoiding any inconsistencies or jarring transitions.",
