      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D cartoon character stand naturally at the center of the image without visible distortions in its proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the chibi-style 3D cartoon character is depicted wearing a construction vest and hard hat, standing center stage among crane-like models. The character's proportions appear balanced and coherent, maintaining the typical design language characteristic of 3D chibi figures, which often feature exaggerated head sizes with compact body proportions. The character is centered without any noticeable distortions in its proportions.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors and materials in the edited image appear consistent and appropriate for a 3D environment.
