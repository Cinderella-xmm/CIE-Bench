    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the waterfall in the center of the image appear as a coherent, transparent projection with smooth flow lines and consistent light interaction, without visible pixelation or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfall appears to be a holographic projection with consistent flow lines and vibrant, coherent light interaction. This modern, high-tech visualization lacks any pixelation or broken shapes, indicative of advanced projective technology or digital rendering. Technologies that create such holographic interactions ensure smooth outlines and light effects, and the image reflects that quality. Therefore, the view is coherent and free of pixelation or breaks in geometry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree trunks and vines in the foreground displaying iridescent fiber-optic-like strands that follow natural branch contours without breaking geometric continuity or exhibiting patchy, non-uniform glow patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree trunks and vines in Image B are depicted with glowing strands that mimic fiber-optic technology. These strands seamlessly follow the natural contours of the trees and vines, maintaining geometric continuity and offering a uniform glow pattern. Fiber-optic displays generally ensure smooth transitions and consistent illumination, which is accurately represented here without any patchiness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vine formations in the foreground and along the riverbanks form continuous, self-supporting loops without floating disconnected segments or geometrically impossible bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows vine formations that form continuous loops, supported by the holographic structure and consistent with natural growth patterns. The design avoids disconnected or suspended segments, ensuring there are no impossible bends or disjointed links. This reflects a structured approach to creating immersive holographic environments, where visual continuity and feasible pathways are maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background landscape (distant mountains and sky) visually consistent with the foreground projections, showing no abrupt transitions, mismatched lighting, or unnatural fog effects that suggest poor layer blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background, largely comprised of holographic elements, merges well with the detailed projections in the scene without any abrupt transitions or lighting mismatches. Unnatural fog effects or blending issues are not evident, which would typically occur in poor layer blending scenarios in digital compositions. The image displays a coherent atmospheric setting, seamlessly integrating background and foreground.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the river stones, foliage, and moss-covered surfaces in the lower portion of the image sharp and detailed, without blurred edges or repeating pattern artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is characterized by a holographic representation that relies on virtual effects, rather than the traditional sharp textures of natural surfaces as seen in Image A. Textures of river stones, foliage, and moss-covered surfaces are not explicitly represented with sharp detail or realistic patterns, reflecting a stylized, futuristic representation lacking blurred edges or artifact patterns typical in digital representations.",
