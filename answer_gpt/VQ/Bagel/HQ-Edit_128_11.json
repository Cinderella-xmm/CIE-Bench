    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the enhanced chandelier retain its symmetrical structure and realistic crystal texture, with no visible distortion or irregularities in its shape or lighting reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chandelier in Image B maintains a symmetrical structure, visible in the evenly distributed arms and central body. The lighting reflections are consistent and realistic, mimicking how a real chandelier would reflect light. The lack of visible distortion or irregularities supports a realistic appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the newly added patterns on the ceiling consistent in style and scale with the existing decorative elements, and do they blend seamlessly without creating visual breaks or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features no visible ceiling patterns; rather, there is a decorative frame surrounding the text and an illustration of a chandelier. The style appears cohesive with the theme, but the absence of actual patterns limits the assessment on blending within architectural elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the silhouette figures in the audience retain recognizable human postures and relative spacing, avoiding unnatural clustering or elongation that would compromise spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show audience figures like in Image A, but instead illustrates a chandelier and piano silhouette with text. Consequently, there are no silhouette figures in the audience to analyze for posture or spacing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sepia tone evenly applied across all surfaces, maintaining visible texture differences between materials such as the wooden floor, piano finish, and gilded ceiling, without introducing muddy or oversaturated areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is characterized by a sepia tone that covers the entire image uniformly. While maintaining consistent coloring across elements like the chandelier and piano silhouette, the absence of texture differences and distinct material depiction leads to no muddy or oversaturated areas.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the grand piano centered correctly on the stage with accurate perspective, intact legs, and natural shadowing that matches the light source from above, without any deformation or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grand piano in Image B is depicted as a silhouette that appears centered within its frame. Even though precise stage positioning is unavailable due to the graphic format, legs are intact, and the symmetrical chandelier above suggests consistent lighting expectation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the text “AN EVENING OF CLASSICAL MAJESTY” clearly visible at the top of the image, properly aligned within the frame, and rendered with crisp edges and consistent stroke weight, without interfering with background details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is prominently displayed at the top, well-aligned within the frame. The choice of a bold font with uniform stroke weight ensures clear visibility without interference from the graphical chandelier and piano silhouette below.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
