    "Question": "Q1: Is the cylindrical body of the tea canister proportionally consistent with the original teapot’s scale and maintains continuous, undistorted dragon engravings along its surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cylindrical body of the tea canister features dragon engravings that appear continuous and undistorted across its surface. The consistency of proportions can be judged by observing that the engravings are distributed evenly, without visible distortions or interruptions, which suggests careful adaptation of the dragon motif to fit a non-teapot shape. Common world knowledge tells us that transforming designs from one object shape to another, like from the rounded teapot shape to a cylindrical canister, can be challenging but achievable with skilled design techniques.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the screw cap appear seamlessly integrated with the canister body, with no visible seams or mismatched textures, and does it exhibit consistent metallic sheen and fine leaf embossing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the screw cap of the canister is examined for seamless integration and texture consistency with the canister body. Visual observation reveals no visible seams or mismatched textures, suggesting an intentional design for integration. The metallic sheen is uniform, and fine embossing of leaf motifs appears detailed and consistent, implying careful crafting. World knowledge about metalworking and embossing techniques supports the conclusion of a well-integrated cap.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the text 'Dragon's Delight' aligned smoothly along the spout’s curve, with legible, evenly spaced characters that do not distort the underlying metal texture or cause unnatural shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Dragon's Delight' is not applied along a spout but instead printed on the cylindrical body in a straightforward manner. The alignment is smooth, with clearly legible and evenly spaced characters, indicating that careful attention was paid to typography placement without affecting the metal texture or causing shading issues. Common sense and graphic design principles confirm that straightforward text placement enhances readability and aesthetic appeal.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the tea leaf logo centered on the cap’s top, rendered with clean lines and uniform depth, and free from jagged edges or inconsistent lighting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tea leaf logo is positioned on the front rather than on top of the canister cap, yet it is centered within its context on the cylinder. The rendering of the logo features clean lines and uniform depth, with no visible jagged edges or lighting inconsistencies, reflecting well-executed graphic design work aimed at achieving visual clarity and professionalism. Understanding logo placement and typical graphic design practices aids this assessment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the dragon engravings fully intact and evenly distributed across the cylindrical body, with no gaps, repetition, or warping that would suggest deformation during the shape conversion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon engravings on the cylindrical body appear intact and evenly distributed, with no visible gaps, repetition, or warping. The engravings are well adapted to the cylindrical shape, maintaining their artistic integrity without signs of distortion, suggesting effective conversion from the teapot to the straight form of the canister. Knowledge of adapting art across different surface shapes informs this evaluation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
