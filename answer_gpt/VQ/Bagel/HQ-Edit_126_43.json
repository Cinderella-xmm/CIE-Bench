      "question": "Is the monocled eye on the front face of the clock seamlessly integrated into the original frame, with no visible seam or texture discontinuity around its perimeter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what appears to be the monocled eye is incorporated into the center of the clock's front face, resembling the visual style of a robot. By observing the image, the monocled eye seems to be a distinctive component of the robot's head, indicating it's not seamlessly integrated into a clock frame but rather positioned as a central feature with its own distinct details and design elements. In comparison, Image A represents a traditional clock with no such monocled eye, indicating a significant alteration in style for Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gear-like limbs extend from the side panels of the clock with continuous material flow and geometric alignment, showing no signs of floating or disconnected joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gear-like limbs are part of the robot's design, clearly showing protruding elements like gears and metal segments extending from its midsection and limbs. These elements are designed to appear as if detached from a typical clock structure—being part of a fictional robotic body. Image A displays no such limbs extending from its structure, as expected from a traditional mechanical clock. This indicates a stylistic transformation in Image B, focusing more on fantasy robotics rather than seamless integration into a clock design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the pendulum converted into a tail that extends downward from the bottom center of the clock, maintaining a smooth curvature and consistent material texture with the rest of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a robot where a tail-like extension exists, likely inspired by elements of clock parts. The tail features distinct metal segments and a curvature visually different from a typical pendulum, suggesting a different function or design style. This complexity in design indicates a creative adaptation rather than a conversion from the pendulum. Image A, with its original pendulum visible within a glass case at the bottom of the clock, does not support a tail extension, emphasizing the stylistic changes made in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the brass and copper tones applied uniformly across the clock’s surface, matching the lighting direction and showing realistic reflections and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals vivid shades of brass and copper, complete with highlights and shadows creating a dramatic steampunk effect across the robot's body. These tones are strategically used to enhance the theme rather than reflecting realism in material properties. Image A employs more traditional, subtle color tones consistent with clock materials but lacks this fantasy-inspired dramatic color contrast and lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the steam valves placed at each corner of the clock’s upper section, protruding outward with clean edges and no overlap or deformation of the surrounding structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple elements like valves and pipes are featured prominently as part of the robot's design, focused on enhancing its fictional machinery appearance. These elements appear integrated into the robot's body rather than positioned within a clock framework, suggesting creative liberty in their placement. In Image A, no visible steam valves exist, focusing on traditional clock features, reinforcing that the additions in Image B are stylistic transformations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the engraved patterns along the clock’s base and sides clear, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the original ornamental design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot design features patterns and engravings characteristic of a steampunk aesthetic, including mechanical, industrial inspiration. The engravings are detailed but cater to the robot's overall visual theme instead of replicating traditional clock design. Image A showcases ornate engravings traditional to antique clocks without incorporating extensive modern mechanical motifs as seen in Image B's alteration.",
