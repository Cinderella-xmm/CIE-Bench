      "question": "Does the golden butterfly appear naturally lit and integrated into the scene without disrupting the existing light sources?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden butterfly in Image B seems to have its own source of light or an integrated glow that matches with the ambient lighting style of the space, such as the warm tones of the mirror's backlight. The butterfly doesn't create any harsh shadows or appear out of place within the overall mood of the lighting, allowing it to be visually compatible with existing light sources.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the material and texture of the golden butterfly consistent with the surrounding surfaces, avoiding any visible unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden butterfly appears to reflect light in a way that is visually harmonious with the reflective surfaces and materials of the bathroom setting. The texture seems smooth and metallic, consistent with possible materials used in decor, such as polished metal or glass. There are no signs of pixelation or mismatch that might suggest an artificial overlay, which could create an unnatural texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shape of the golden butterfly structurally coherent and free from distortion, maintaining proper geometry as it appears above the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shape of the golden butterfly in Image B appears symmetrical and properly proportioned, which are key characteristics of a structurally coherent object. Its wings and body are aligned correctly, without any distortion or warping that might indicate improper placement or editing. The geometry seems intact and fits with expectations for a butterfly decor item.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the position of the golden butterfly above the mirror contribute positively to the overall composition without creating visual discontinuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is positioned centrally above the mirror. This placement draws attention and can be seen as adding a focal point to the composition. Its symmetry and alignment with the mirror's reflection help maintain continuity in the design, enhancing rather than detracting from the overall aesthetic of the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the golden butterfly been preserved, ensuring clarity and sharpness in comparison to the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fine details of the golden butterfly in Image B, such as the markings and edges of its wings, are clear and sharp, which matches the rest of the image that also exhibits a high level of detail. The clarity of the butterfly is consistent with the clarity of other elements, such as the texture of the vase and the branches, ensuring a cohesive appearance throughout the image.",
