    "Question": "Q1: Does the shimmering mane formed from the water maintain fluid motion and transparency consistent with the original waterfall, without appearing solid or rigid?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon has a mane that appears more solid and stylized compared to a naturally flowing waterfall. The mane has defined strands that do not retain the fluid motion or transparency of water, indicating it does not mimic the smooth motion of the waterfall seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the scale patterns on the transformed rock body seamlessly integrated with the original stone texture, without visible seams, unnatural repetition, or distorted geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, there is just rock texture, while in Image B, the dragon scales are introduced. These scales are clearly defined and detailed with glowing runes, and they do not appear integrated with the original stone texture. This is due to the distinct nature of dragon scales versus natural rock surfaces, which can lead to visible seams or distortions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the cloud wings formed from the foam extend naturally from the dragon’s body and align with the direction of water movement, without appearing detached or floating unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows cloud-like wings on the dragon, seeming more stylized and detached, without a direct and natural flow or alignment with water movement as seen in Image A. Instead of following the dynamics of water foam, the wings demonstrate a distinct artistic interpretation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the glowing blue runes embedded into the scales with smooth, diffused light emission and no sharp edges or unnatural brightness that disrupts the surrounding texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the light emitted from the runes is smoothly diffused and blends well into the dragon's scales, without harsh edges or brightness creating a conflict with the overall scale texture. This indicates a well-integrated design, unlike sharp or overly bright elements that would disrupt the pattern.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the shadows and highlights on the dragon’s body and wings match the direction and intensity of natural sunlight in the original scene, without conflicting illumination or floating highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, sunlight is seen interacting naturally with the waterfall and rocks. In Image B, the dragon's body and wings have highlights that follow a consistent lighting direction, aligning well with the light source's direction and intensity observed in the original image, without conflicting or unnatural lighting effects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
