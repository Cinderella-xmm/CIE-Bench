    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the hat symmetrical and aligned with the brim and crown, without jagged edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric patterns on the hat are designed in a stylized manner with smooth, flowing lines. The patterns appear symmetrical and are well-aligned with the structure of the hat, maintaining a cohesive visual flow without jagged edges or interruptions. This suggests a high level of precision in the design, aimed at creating a harmonious overall appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the brim follow the contour of the hat and reflect light naturally, without appearing as flat or detached patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold accents seem integrated into the design of the hat. They align with the contours of the brim and add a dynamic element to the visual presentation. These accents are stylized, providing contrast and depth without looking like flat additions. The design suggests an understanding of how light plays off metallic surfaces, contributing to a realistic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the turquoise, cream, and silver motifs smoothly blended into the fabric, without abrupt color shifts or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The use of turquoise, cream, and silver in Image B is strategic, with colors transitioning smoothly from one to another. This seamless blend creates a cohesive design across the hat, maintaining visual fluidity. The absence of abrupt shifts or pixelated edges supports the notion of a carefully rendered graphic design, contributing to a polished aesthetic.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the patterns on the hat avoid intersecting or distorting the natural wave and volume of the hair, maintaining clear separation between the two?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the hat are distinct from the stylized representation of hair. The hair maintains its flow and volume, with the hat's patterns clearly separate from it. This deliberate separation suggests thoughtful design to ensure that each element retains its visual integrity and does not interfere with each other's stylistic expression.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the shape of the hatâ€™s brim and crown preserved with consistent thickness and curvature, without visible warping or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hat in Image B presents a consistent outline with smooth curves along both the brim and crown. There are no signs of warping or deformation, indicating an attention to detail in maintaining the hat's intended shape. The consistency in thickness and curvature suggests consideration for a naturalistic depiction, enhancing the overall quality of the design.",
