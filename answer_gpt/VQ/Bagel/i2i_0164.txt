    "Question": "Q1: Does the area on the train where people were previously sitting look natural without any obvious artifacts or gaps?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the area atop the train where people were previously sitting has been edited. The seat looks smooth and consistent with the rest of the train's structure, maintaining its visual continuity. There are no visible artifacts, color mismatches, or gaps indicating an editing error; the area appears flat and naturally integrated into the train’s design. This suggests careful attention to editing detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the conductor added atop the train well-integrated with the existing lighting and shadows, giving a natural appearance?",
    "explanation": "The conductor added in Image B is positioned on the train and illuminated by the same light source visible in the environment. The shadowsing on the conductor matches the direction and intensity of the existing shadows on the train, suggesting a seamless integration with the lighting conditions present. Additionally, his uniform contrasts visibly but naturally against the backdrop, reinforcing integration into the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the flag held by the conductor look natural, with proper proportions and a logical position relative to the train's motion?",
    "explanation": "The flag added in Image B is proportionate to the size of the conductor and hangs logically from his hand, complementing his position. The flag's placement is consistent with the movement and dynamics expected from a train in motion, including alignment relative to the smoke direction. Its appearance does not disturb the logic of the natural dynamics of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there any distortions or misalignments in the train's structure near the area where people were removed, and the conductor was added?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the train retains its structural integrity with no visible distortions or misalignments resulting from the removal of people and the addition of the conductor. The lines and angles of the train remain consistent throughout its length, matching those in Image A and displaying no irregularities that would suggest poor editing practices.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the overall composition of the image remain balanced and stable after editing, with no noticeable shifts caused by the removal and addition of people?",
    "explanation": "The composition of Image B maintains balance, even with the alterations. The addition of the conductor and flag creates a focal point while maintaining equilibrium with the surrounding elements—smoke, train structure, and audience. The scene's flow and overall composition remain coherent, neither drawing disproportionate attention to the edits nor disrupting the image’s stability.",
    "answer": "Yes"
