    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all LEGO bricks forming the bed frame, mattress, and base properly aligned and interlocked without visible gaps or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks appear tightly interlocked as per typical LEGO construction, with no visible gaps between them. Each brick shows a consistent alignment, fitting well within the overall structure. World knowledge dictates that LEGO is designed for precise interlocking, which is evident here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the light blue floral pattern on the duvet appear consistent with the original design, with no missing or incorrectly placed colored bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO representation of the bedding, which replaces the floral pattern with solid blue LEGO bricks. Without seeing Image A, this is not a pattern but rather a color choice that doesn’t relate directly to the original. Thus, the floral pattern from Image A is absent in the LEGO version.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the curved shape of the new headboard composed of LEGO-style elements that follow realistic LEGO curvature without appearing stretched or deformed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The headboard in Image B uses curved LEGO bricks to mimic a realistic curve, which conforms with standard LEGO construction methods. LEGO curvature is limited by the brick design, and this headboard seems accurately constructed without visible stretch or deformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pillows formed by stacked LEGO bricks showing a natural three-dimensional shape with appropriate layering and no floating or disconnected pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pillows are constructed with stacked LEGO bricks giving an impression of depth and layering typical of LEGO designs. The layers are connected and do not appear floating or disconnected, indicating a well-crafted representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the LEGO bed match the lighting direction and softness of the original image, with no unnatural dark spots or over-bright areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays shadows that are consistent with the lighting direction of Image A. The softness and extent of the shadows do not show any discrepancies or unnatural brightness, suggesting that the lighting in Image B matches the original’s light direction and softness.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the proportions and positions of the pillows, duvet, and headboard consistent with the original bed, with no noticeable scaling errors or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing with Image A indicates that Image B employs LEGO bricks to mimic the proportions and positions. The relative positions of pillows, duvet, and headboard align well with their respective roles in Image A, maintaining a similar layout without apparent scaling or placement errors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all LEGO bricks have a uniform matte finish with no unnatural glossiness, transparency, or pixelation that would suggest low-quality rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO bricks in Image B exhibit a matte finish typical of LEGO products, with no glossiness, transparency, or signs of pixelation. This uniform finish suggests high-quality rendering consistent with LEGO’s visual style.",
