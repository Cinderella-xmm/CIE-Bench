      "question": "Does the marble grotto structure exhibit uniform stone-like texture and natural veining throughout, without artificial-looking smoothness or irregular patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grotto resembles materials like marble with visible natural veining patterns and an overall stone-like texture. The surface appears consistent with marble, which typically features a uniform textured appearance. There's no indication of artificial smoothness or unnatural patches that could suggest otherwise. Recognizing common characteristics of marble helps confirm the texture and veining.",

      "question": "Do the porcelain figurines retain accurate anatomical proportions and facial features without deformation, and do they display a consistent glossy finish across all surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurines in Image B have a consistent glossy appearance typical of porcelain material across their surfaces. However, the facial features are not detailed; they are simplified without specific anatomical detail but maintain a uniform and proportional representation in line with stylized artistic choices that can be common for decorative or religious depictions.",

      "question": "Are the gold leaf details confined to garment edges and halos, applied evenly and without overlapping or smudging, and do they reflect light naturally without creating harsh highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold leaf details are situated on the garment edges and the halos, reflecting light in a manner that enhances their decorative function. There are no visible signs of uneven application, overlaps, or smudging. The gold elements reflect light naturally, avoiding overly bright or harsh light spots, which implies careful application.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The columns and arches illustrated in Image B are proportionally scaled to complement the figurines and establish a cohesive display. Each structural component aligns with the overall scene, maintaining a correct perspective, without any indication of skewed angles or disconnected, floating parts. Their portrayal provides a stable and coherent design fitting the nativity theme depicted.",
