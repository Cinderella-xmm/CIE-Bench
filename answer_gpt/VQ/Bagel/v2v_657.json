      "question": "Does the Funko Pop figure box maintain the structural coherence of the original image, avoiding any unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues of Image B, the box appears structurally coherent with clear and natural detail presentation. The lines are straight, and the colors and textures on the box are consistent with the type of packaging expected for such a product, avoiding unnatural distortions. This judgment is based on the common appearance of these collectible boxes in merchandising contexts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine inside the box retain its proportions and physical rationality, avoiding any distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine inside the box maintains a typical chibi design which includes exaggerated features such as a larger head. This proportion is consistent with how chibi-style figures are usually designed. There isn't any apparent distortion in the figure itself apart from the expected stylized proportions which are intentional for this type of figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the detailed textures and lighting on the realistic figurine outside the box natural and consistent with the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine outside the box has consistent textures and lighting that align with the overall lighting conditions displayed in Image B. The shadows and reflective surfaces are coherent with expected physical properties in three-dimensional objects within artificial lighting conditions, lending a natural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the original image and the edited elements seamless, free of unnatural textures and loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without referring to Image A, in Image B the edited addition of the Funko Pop figure box integrates well without apparent seams, texture mismatches, or loss of details. This evaluation is based on the coherent blending of colors and perspective within the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of the Funko Pop figure box and its contents does not disrupt the overall visual credibility nor the structural consistency of the image. The edited image retains a natural appearance, owing to coherent textures, consistent lighting, and proper scaling.",
