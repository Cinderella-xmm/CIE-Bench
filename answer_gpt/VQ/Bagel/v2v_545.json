      "question": "Does the sparrow maintain its natural proportions and texture details without appearing overly stylized or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow features exaggerated facial features such as large eyes, resembling a cartoon or animated version rather than a realistic bird. This stylization lacks the intricate feather textures typically found in realistic depictions. Therefore, the sparrow does not maintain its natural proportions and texture details, appearing overly stylized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the sparrow appear to be perched naturally on the wooden chair without any distortion or unnatural positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the exaggerated features, the sparrow is positioned in a way that aligns with natural perching behavior. Its claws are gripping the chair's top rail, maintaining a balanced posture that appears physically plausible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the wooden chair exhibit realistic wood grain and texture without any unnatural artifacts or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden chair in Image B displays a smoother, less detailed surface texture compared to a realistic wooden chair. This results in a slightly artificial appearance as the fine wood grain and texture details seen in real wood are absent, indicating a loss of detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the sparrow and the chair consistent and natural, contributing to the overall realism of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B displays consistent lighting and shadows on both the sparrow and the chair, the stylized nature of the sparrow and the less detailed chair disrupt the realism. However, in terms of technical execution, the shadows appear to be cast accurately based on the light source, suggesting consistency in lighting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the sparrow and the chair look visually credible and undistorted in the 3D-rendered depiction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition and layout maintain spatial consistency, with the sparrow perched appropriately on the chair. Despite the use of a stylized rendering technique, the overall scene is coherent and undistorted, resembling a plausible 3D depiction in arrangement and balance.",
