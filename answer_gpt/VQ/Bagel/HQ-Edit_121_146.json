      "question": "Does the glass candle chamber maintain consistent transparency and refractive qualities with natural glass, and are the embossed gold floral motifs clearly defined without distortion or unnatural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass candle chamber appears to have a smooth surface that suggests transparency and refractive qualities similar to natural glass. The embossed gold floral motifs are well-defined, with clear outlines and no apparent distortion or texture issues. The light reflects naturally off the surface, indicating good clarity and refraction. These visual cues align with the characteristics of glass and well-crafted gold embossing.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the wooden lid is crafted to match the teapot's handle's contour and curvature, offering a cohesive transition between the elements. The wood grain appears authentic, with natural patterns and a polished finish. There are no visible artifacts or distortions, and the light reflects naturally off the lid, maintaining the overall fidelity to the teapot's design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand logo is located on the base in a position that aligns with the existing decorative elements.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a patterned fabric background beneath the teapot. The texture appears consistent, and the lighting interacts naturally with the material, mirroring the shadow and reflection patterns of the teapot accurately. There are no visible seams or discrepancies in the lighting, indicating a well-integrated and seamless addition to the scene.",
