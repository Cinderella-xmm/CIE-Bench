      "question": "Does the church's façade maintain its original architectural shape and symmetry when rendered in porcelain, with no distorted columns, misaligned arches, or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a miniature replica of a church made of porcelain. The visual cues indicate that the church’s façade is carefully crafted with attention to symmetry and details. The columns and arches appear aligned, consistent, and proportional, which suggests that the architectural integrity has been maintained. Without comparison to Image A, the symmetry and shape seem preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all human figures replaced with pewter models that have anatomically correct hands with no more than five fingers, and do they maintain natural postures without joint bending or limb distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures are portrayed as tiny pewter models. From the visual cues, the figures appear to have a natural posture, and although the minute size may make detailed inspection difficult, they generally resemble human anatomy. This includes what appears to be correct hand structure with no more than five fingers. The models display no noticeable limb distortion or unnatural posture.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the baroque-style dome fully enclosing the scene without gaps, overlapping incorrectly with the church or ground, or showing seams or incomplete surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dome in Image B is visible as a continuous structure, neatly enclosing the architectural scene beneath it. It does not overlap inappropriately with the church structure, nor does it exhibit any gaps or incomplete surfaces. The seamless appearance suggests the dome was carefully crafted to maintain its architectural style.",

      "question": "Do the glass trees retain natural branch structures and show transparent, refractive qualities without jagged outlines or unnatural coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are visually represented with smooth surfaces and elegantly modeled shapes. They possess a refractive quality common in glass, suggesting material transparency. The branches appear natural and consistent, devoid of jagged edges or strange color variations, aligning with typical glass tree structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the café tables and umbrellas scaled down appropriately with intact shapes—specifically, do the umbrella canopies remain circular and the table legs remain straight and evenly spaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases scaled-down café setups with umbrella canopies appearing circular and proportional. The table legs seem evenly spaced and straight, indicative of appropriate scaling. There is no apparent distortion or irregularity in the café furniture, suggesting attention to detail in the miniaturization process.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the antique marble base display consistent veining patterns and appropriate thickness, and is it positioned directly beneath the scene without floating or clipping errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marble base in Image B is depicted as having a consistent veining pattern typical of high-quality designs. Its thickness is visually suitable for supporting the scene above. There are no visual cues indicating the base is floating or improperly clipped, suggesting well-maintained positioning under the architectural setup.",
