    "Question": "Q1: Are all spherical and cubic elements converted into LEGO brick shapes with consistent rectangular prismatic geometry, preserving structural integrity and avoiding warped or broken edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the objects are transformed into a consistent block shape reminiscent of LEGO bricks. They have edges and surfaces that maintain the structural integrity and show no signs of warping or breakage. This shows careful transformation into rectangular prismatic shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the transformed LEGO bricks exhibit a uniform matte surface finish without specular highlights or reflections that contradict the intended LEGO material?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks have a smooth and matte surface finish. There are no visible reflections or highlights that would suggest a glossy or non-uniform surface, which is consistent with typical LEGO brick material.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there visible, proportionally accurate interlocking features (e.g., studs or recesses) on the tops and sides of the LEGO bricks that match standard LEGO design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bricks possess square recesses that suggest interlocking features but lack the classic round studs seen on traditional LEGO bricks. This suggests non-standard LEGO design elements are present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are all LEGO bricks arranged in a stable, grounded formation on a wooden shelf surface, with no floating or suspended pieces that defy gravity or spatial logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks are uniformly stacked and grounded on a wooden shelf. There are no pieces appearing to float or suspend in the air, indicating a stable and logical arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the background uniformly simplified into a clean, neutral tone without any residual textures, shadows, or depth cues that conflict with the minimalist intent?",
    "explanation": "Image B has a background of a plain, neutral tone without visible textures, shadows, or depth cues, which supports the minimalist design goal and maintains focus on the LEGO blocks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
