      "question": "Does the chibi-style illustration of the dog retain its distinct characteristics without unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is simplified into a chibi-style illustration, characterized by smooth and clean lines typical of minimalistic or cartoonish designs. This style inherently lacks the detailed textures found in realistic images, focusing instead on capturing the essence or key attributes of the subject. The dog's features, like its closed eyes and overall shape, are retained well enough to convey its likeness without losing distinct characteristics. The absence of intricate textures is expected and intentional in this style, avoiding any unnatural appearances or loss of important details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bold white outline around the illustration enhance visual clarity without disrupting structural coherence or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bold white outline in Image B serves to separate the illustration from the background, improving visual clarity and making the elements stand out individually. The outline is consistent and clean, maintaining the structural coherence of the image. There are no visible artifacts or distortions caused by the outline, which would typically appear as uneven lines or misalignments. This enhances the sticker's aesthetic, ensuring that each component remains distinct and easy to identify, aiding in the overall perception of the design.",

      "question": "Do the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag maintain structural consistency and visual credibility in their minimalist flat design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, these elements are rendered with a flat, minimalist approach, focused on simple shapes and outlines to depict their forms. The bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag maintain their recognizable shapes and proportions, ensuring structural consistency. Minimalistic design often relies on such cues rather than intricate details to convey objects. These elements do not appear distorted or misleading, preserving their visual credibility as simplified representations of the real objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the extension of the dog and bench slightly beyond the circular frame preserve natural appearance and avoid distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design in Image B extends some elements beyond the standard boundary line of the sticker, as seen around the dog and bench. This is a common design choice to make elements appear less rigid and more dynamic, without necessarily causing distortion. This technique is used purposefully to make the illustration seem more engaging and maintain a natural appearance. The extensions do not interfere with the perception or proportions of the portrayed objects, preserving their intended shapes.",

      "question": "Does the transparent background maintain the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A transparent background in stickers or illustrations allows for seamless integration onto various surfaces, providing versatility in use. Image B uses this approach, ensuring none of the objects are obscured or blended unnaturally with the background. The transparency upholds the authenticity of the sticker by not interfering with the clean visual presentation of the design, making it adaptable and retaining its natural appearance when placed against any background.",
