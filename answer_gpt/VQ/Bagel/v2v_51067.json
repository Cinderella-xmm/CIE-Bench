        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors applied to the van's body are teal and white, commonly associated with a retro beach theme.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image presents a warm, slightly desaturated tone that suggests an aged, nostalgic look typical of vintage beach postcards.
