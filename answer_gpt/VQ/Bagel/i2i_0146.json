      "question": "Are the stripes on the zebra consistent with its natural patterns without appearing as unnatural or disjointed lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, the zebra is depicted with simplified cartoon-like stripes that are bold and uniformly distributed, lacking the characteristic irregular and varied stripe pattern of real zebras. World knowledge indicates that real zebras have more complex and varied stripes. The simplified design of the stripes indicates an unrealistic depiction of a zebra.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the zebra's ears maintain their natural upright position without any distortion or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, the ears are shown in an upright position typical of zebra anatomy. The stylized representation in the form of a toy character captures the shape and position of ears accurately. Comparing this to the real zebra in Image A would show similarity in the stance of the ears despite the stylization, maintaining a consistency in positioning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the zebra maintain realistic proportions in its limbs and body, avoiding any grossly exaggerated or distorted features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The zebra in image B is presented as a stylized toy with intentionally exaggerated features, such as larger limbs and a compact body structure uncharacteristic of a real zebra. World knowledge of cartoon or toy design suggests these proportions are common and expected in such depictions, mainly for appeal and recognizability for children.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the texture of the zebra's coat smooth and free of unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a plastic toy zebra with a smooth and shiny surface typical of plastic materials, without any apparent pixelation or texture artifacts. This is consistent with the realistic rendering of a toy in a photograph, reflecting a clean, manufactured appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the grass around the zebra unaltered and free of any editing artifacts, maintaining its natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is plain yellow without any grass or natural context, which contrasts with the natural grassy setting of Image A. As a toy depiction, the absence of grass and focus on a clean, solid background is typical of product photography, eliminating any reference to natural appearance.",
