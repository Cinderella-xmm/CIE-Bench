      "question": "Do the extended stripes seamlessly blend into the grass without creating unnatural textures or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are extended into the ground around it. Instead of blending into grass, the entire ground has been transformed into a striped pattern that matches the zebra's stripes. This does not create a seamless blend with natural grass as seen in Image A, but rather creates a distinctly patterned and surreal ground surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stripes extended in a way that preserves the original geometric structure and proportions of the zebra's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes on the zebra appear consistent with its natural pattern, and there is no alteration in the geometric structure and proportions of the zebra's body itself. The stripes have been extended to the ground in a surreal manner, but the body proportions of the zebra appear unchanged compared to Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a visually credible composition where the zebra remains the focal point without being overshadowed by the surreal extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, even with the background altered to extend the zebra's stripes across the ground, the zebra itself remains the focal point. The contrast between the zebra's natural stripes and the extended stripes draws attention to the zebra without overshadowing it because the consistent pattern highlights the zebra itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are key features of the zebra such as its mane, ears, and legs still clearly visible and natural looking amidst the surreal extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the key features of the zebra such as its mane, ears, and legs are still clearly visible and have retained their natural appearance. The editing has primarily affected the ground, not altering the zebra's anatomical features or natural look.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the zebra's stripes and the grass been preserved without noticeable degradation or introduction of artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fine details of the zebra's stripes on its body have been preserved accurately and show no significant loss of detail. However, the grass has been completely replaced by a striped pattern, which means its fine details are not preserved and instead have been transformed into a uniform pattern. There is no visible degradation of the zebra's detail itself, but the grass has been altered.",
