    "Question": "Q1: Do the shoulder and chest armor sections display realistic metallic sheen with proper light reflection and depth, avoiding flat or overly shiny surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the armor sections on the shoulder and chest exhibit a metallic sheen that reflects light in a realistic manner. The highlights and shadows are appropriate and suggest depth, indicating a three-dimensional form. These characteristics are consistent with how metallic surfaces reflect light in real-world conditions. The sheen is neither overly shiny nor flat, showcasing the proper texture and material properties expected of metal.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the joint areas of the armor aligned with the underlying anatomy and free from geometric distortions or unnatural gaps?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the joint areas of the armor appear to follow the natural curves of the body without any visible distortion or misalignment. The armor fits snugly over what would presumably be the person's anatomy, and there are no unnatural gaps or overlaps between the segments that would suggest errors in rendering or alignment. This suggests an accurate alignment with the underlying anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the metallic hair strands appear as continuous, flowing wires with consistent color gradients and reflective properties, without breaking or clumping unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hair strands are depicted in vibrant shades with reflective and metallic properties. These strands flow continuously and smoothly, resembling wires rather than natural hair. The color gradients exhibit consistent transitions, and the strands do not appear broken or clumped in any odd manner. This treatment creates an impression of metallic material that is both fluid and cohesive.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background a uniform, neutral gray tone with no visible remnants of the original setting or inconsistent lighting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a uniform, neutral gray without any remnants of previous settings or inconsistent lighting. This backdrop provides a clean and unobtrusive environment that enhances the visibility of the subject, which helps maintain focus on the character and the armor's details.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all edited regions—armor, hair, and background—seamlessly integrated with smooth transitions and no visible artifacts like pixelation or mismatched edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edits to the armor, hair, and background exhibit smooth transitions between different elements. There are no noticeable artifacts such as pixelation or mismatched edges that detract from the overall visual quality. The integration of these elements appears seamless, with consistent treatment across the image, suggesting a cohesive and high-quality rendering process.",
    "answer": "Yes"
