      "question": "Does the mango retain its recognizable shape and texture in the 8-bit pixel art style without appearing overly distorted or unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is depicted in an 8-bit pixel art style, characterized by blocky and simplified graphics typical of retro video games. This style inherently simplifies details and texture, yet the essential shape of the mango is maintained. Despite the stylization, the mango is still identifiable as a mango, suggesting that while details are minimized, the overall form isn't overly distorted. This indicates that the mango retains its recognizable shape in the 8-bit pixel art style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the table and napkin depicted with consistent structure and proportions in the 8-bit pixel art style, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or disproportionate elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blocky nature of 8-bit style maintains clear division lines, preserving basic proportions and structural integrity of objects like the table and napkin. While the napkin appears more abstractly due to the stylization, its position relative to the mango and table remains proportionate and coherent. No broken geometric or disproportionate shapes are evident, indicating that the table and napkin's structure and proportions are appropriately consistent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the fine details of the mango's surface and the napkin's texture remain discernible in the 8-bit pixel art style, without significant loss or introduction of unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, owing to the 8-bit pixel art style, the fine details of the mango's surface and the napkin's texture are significantly simplified into solid colors and basic shapes. This style is known for sacrificing detailed textures for broader, bolder outlines and pixelated coloring. While the objects are recognizable, the specific textures are lost, replaced by simplified forms, indicating that there is a loss of discernible texture on both the mango and the napkin.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadow effects on the mango and table in the 8-bit pixel art style appear natural and plausible, without introducing any obvious artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadow are represented through contrasts in color typical of 8-bit art. While shadows and highlights are simplistic, they are applied in a consistent manner across the mango and table, approximately matching expected positioning due to a light source. Despite the crudeness of these effects, there are no glaring inconsistencies or artifacts, achieving a level of plausible representation within the constraints of the medium.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition and layout of the mango, napkin, and table in the 8-bit pixel art style visually credible and structurally sound, without any elements appearing misplaced or out of context?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition retains the central focus on the mango placed on a napkin on a table, which mirrors the structural intent of the original image. The positioning and spatial arrangement of these elements remain coherent and logical, consistent with a real-world scenario. Despite the simplification, these elements do not appear misplaced or out of context, supporting a credible composition.",
