      "question": "Does the suit jacket exhibit watercolor-style blue-black tones with smooth transitions and no visible digital artifacts such as jagged edges or unnatural blotches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit jacket presents a watercolor-like effect characterized by smooth transitions between blue and black tones. To determine if there are digital artifacts, I assessed the continuity of the color transitions and their smoothness, observing that there are no visible jagged edges or blotches. With the absence of these digital imperfections, the conclusion is based on the visual evidence supporting the smooth aesthetic quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the golden pinstripes aligned with the suit’s fabric grain and do they reflect light consistently with the surrounding material, avoiding floating or misaligned lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden pinstripes on the suit appear to be consistently aligned with the fabric’s grain. Their reflections and alignment are visually integrated with the material's texture, avoiding any appearance of floating or misaligned lines. The analysis involved observing the flow and uniform integration of the pinstripes into the surrounding fabric, ensuring their proper reflection with the material.",

      "question": "Is the pattern on the tie uniformly distributed, maintaining consistent size and spacing across its surface without stretching or repeating errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tie’s pattern looks uniformly distributed without noticeable inconsistencies in the size and spacing of the design elements. Observing the tie’s surface for signs of stretching or repeating errors, it maintains a consistent pattern, indicating a coherent and intentional design.",

      "question": "Does the leather-bound border feature realistic texture details such as stitching, grain, and embossed lettering without warping or clipping the subject’s features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leather-bound border shows texture details resembling real leather characteristics, such as stitching and grain. These elements appear without distortion or clipping into the subject’s features, suggesting a thoughtful integration into the image. The analysis involved examining visual texture continuity and edge definition, confirming realistic texture details without interference.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background and surface of the image show a soft, uniform satin paper texture with subtle reflections, avoiding harsh glare or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background and surface appear to exhibit a soft and uniform texture akin to satin paper. The reflections are subtle, contributing to the overall smoothness of the visual presentation, effectively avoiding any harsh glare or pixelation. The conclusion is drawn from the absence of harsh light effects and notable pixelation marks, indicative of a refined texture handling.",
