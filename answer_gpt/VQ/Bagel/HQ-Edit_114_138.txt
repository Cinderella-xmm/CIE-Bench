    "Question": "Q1: Does the silk robe exhibit natural fabric texture with consistent gold highlights and floral patterns that follow realistic light interaction and material properties?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robe features a glossy finish with vibrant colors and bold floral designs, which suggest an artistic interpretation rather than realistic fabric behavior. Natural fabric texture usually involves subtle variations in lighting and material interaction, which is not fully present in the flat, stylized depiction. This indicates that although the silk robe in Image B is visually similar to silk garments, it does not follow realistic light interaction due to its stylized appearance.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the book’s shape preserved with realistic page layers and depth, avoiding broken edges, inconsistent thickness, or floating components that disrupt its structural coherence?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the book is depicted as having an exaggerated and flat style with visible colors on pages, rather than the natural layers and thickness seen in a real book. This artistic presentation features stylized straight, uniform edges and an unrealistic depiction of binding and pages, which does not match the natural structure of a real book.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the bookshelf designs integrated without altering the original shelf alignment, spacing, or wood grain texture, maintaining visual credibility and structural rationality?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, bookshelf designs are represented in a decorative manner, with bordered patterns and lack of realistic wood texture. The shelves have consistent and symmetric alignment; however, they lack the nuanced texture of wood grain. Rather than being presented as a natural wooden structure, it's more decorative, focusing on symmetry in alignment but lacking realistic texture detail.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the bookmark panels appear correctly inserted between the book’s pages, with proper scale, orientation, and connection to the book, avoiding floating or misaligned placement?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the bookmark panels as part of the stylized book drawing with colors. They appear to be treated more as an integral part of the artistic design rather than functional elements correctly inserted between pages. This format doesn't demonstrate the expected real-world function and positioning of bookmarks, indicating an artistic rather than realistic portrayal.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the facial features, particularly around the eyes and mouth, proportionally accurate and free from exaggerated or distorted shapes that compromise visual plausibility?",

    "answer": "No"
