      "question": "Does the cat’s body maintain the original shape and proportions when transformed into quartz and obsidian crystals, with no visible warping or unnatural breaks in form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is reimagined in a stylized form with sharp and defined geometric crystal shapes, resembling quartz and obsidian. The transformed cat retains a recognizable silhouette similar to the original cat's body shape, but the sharpness and angularity of the crystals create a more abstract interpretation. Despite this abstraction, the proportions are maintained in terms of overall size and the differentiation of body parts such as the head, body, and tail, without visible warping or breaks. Thus, the original shape and proportions are preserved in a stylized manner.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the emerald crystal eyes positioned correctly within the eye sockets, showing consistent size, shape, and reflective qualities that match the original facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are represented by emerald crystals set into the angular crystal structure that serves as the cat’s head. They are consistent in size and shape, positioned symmetrically on the face. Reflective qualities are in line with how crystals would reflect light, suggesting a shift from the organic reflection of eyes to a faceted one. Compared to Image A, where eyes are more naturally rounded and set into a furry face, the positioning in Image B is consistent within the constraints of the crystal transformation maintaining the facial structure.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cat’s front paws and hind legs properly positioned on the wooden block, with no floating or disconnected segments that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's structure on the wooden block reflects a geometric crystal design. The body, front paws, and hind legs maintain an integrated appearance with the wooden block, preserving a sense of groundedness. These crystal segments connect logically, avoiding any floating or disconnected appearance. The abstract design adheres to the concept of physical logic despite the stylized form, similar to how the cat in Image A is naturally positioned on the block.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the quartz and obsidian surfaces display realistic textures with natural variations in translucency, shading, and edge definition, without pixelation or unnatural smoothness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfaces of the quartz and obsidian in Image B display realistic crystal textures, with distinct edges and variations in translucency and shading. These textures create the impression of multifaceted surfaces typical of such materials. There is no pixelation present, and the crystal surfaces possess the expected reflective qualities and sharpness, contributing to a naturalistic appearance in coherence with how real crystals interact with light.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden block visually consistent with the original image in terms of texture, color, and lighting, and does it cast appropriate shadows under the crystal cat without unnatural gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden block in Image B exhibits similar texture, color, and lighting to Image A, resembling a natural wood finish with appropriate grain and hue. Shadows cast by the crystal cat follow expected physical laws, appearing under the cat without any unnatural gaps or distortions, consistent with how shadows would behave in realistic lighting conditions. The interaction of the block with the transformed crystal cat maintains visual consistency with the overall scene.",
