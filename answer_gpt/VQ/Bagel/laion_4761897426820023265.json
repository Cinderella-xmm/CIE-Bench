    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edge of the snow globe smooth and continuous, with no visible seams, distortions, or pixelation along its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edge of the snow globe appears to be a perfect sphere, indicating a smooth and continuous surface. There are no visible imperfections like seams, distortions, or pixelation, which can often be indicators of editing or low quality. The representation of the smooth glass aligns with how a real snow globe would look, without any visual disruptions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the reflections and refractions on the snow globe surface consistent with how light behaves on clear glass, showing subtle bending of the scene behind it and soft highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The light behavior on the surface of the snow globe in Image B indicates proper reflections and refractions. The surface appears to capture soft highlights and shows a realistic bending of light, which is typical of glass. This suggests that the graphical rendering of reflections and refractions is consistent with natural light behavior on clear glass.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all visible figures inside the snow globe have complete and correctly proportioned limbs, with no extra fingers, missing arms, or distorted postures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures inside the snow globe in Image B look to be correctly proportioned and complete. There is no indication of extra fingers, missing limbs, or any distorted postures visible. The figures appear as small models would, with proper representation of human form, respecting natural proportions typically found in miniature figures.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the autumn-colored leaves integrated smoothly into the existing green vegetation, with no abrupt color changes or blocky textures indicating digital overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the autumn-colored leaves are blended well into the existing greenery, without any visible abrupt transitions or blocky textures that would suggest a digital overlay. The color transition appears smooth and natural, resembling how autumn leaves might naturally mix with non-deciduous trees.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the snow particles visible throughout the globe in a dynamic, swirling pattern, and do they not fully cover the Great Wall or figures, allowing them to remain clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow particles inside the globe have been depicted in a way to suggest they are suspended in a dynamic pattern. While they are scattered evenly, they do not obscure the visibility of the Great Wall or the figures inside the globe, which remain clear and undistorted. This mimics how snow particles would behave inside a snow globe.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the ceramic birds clearly distinguishable as small flying objects with defined wings and bodies, and are they located in the air above the Wall without touching any surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceramic birds can be identified clearly as small objects with distinguished wings and bodies. Their positions in mid-air suggest flight, and they do not appear to be in contact with other surfaces, which helps to underline their depiction as birds in motion above the Wall.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the wooden base dark in color, textured with realistic grain, and does it support the snow globe without floating or tilting, with the engraved text clearly legible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B is dark in color and shows a realistic wood grain texture. It provides stable support for the snow globe, showing no signs of floating or tilting. The engraved text on the base is clearly legible and well-integrated into the design, fulfilling the criteria for a realistic depiction of the base.",
