    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the statue exhibit a consistent clay-like texture across all body parts, including the face, limbs, and torso, without visible patches of mismatched material or unnatural graininess?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue appears to have a uniform clay-like texture, suggesting it's made from a single material. The limbs, torso, and other parts exhibit a smooth, consistent surface without any visible patches or changes in material. Combining this visual information with common knowledge about clay sculptures, which typically feature a consistent texture, leads to the conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass dome fully transparent with no visible distortion of the statue's shape or features behind it, and does it display natural reflections and refractions consistent with real glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears fully transparent, showing the statue inside without distortion. The reflections and refractions are minimal, resembling how real glass would behave under controlled lighting conditions. This observation aligns with real-world knowledge about how glass interacts with light.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lotus and wave patterns on the glass dome evenly spaced, clearly defined, and integrated smoothly into the surface without overlapping or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns on the glass dome in Image B are observed to be evenly spaced and clearly defined, smoothly integrated onto the surface. There are no overlapping elements or jagged edges, aligning with common design practices ensuring aesthetics in decorative features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the trident, snake, and drum exhibit enhanced golden highlights under the spotlight without visible halo effects, color bleeding, or overexposed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trident, snake, and drum show enhanced gold highlights that catch the light effectively, without halo effects or color bleeding beyond their boundaries. There are no overexposed areas, suggesting a nuanced use of lighting consistent with high-quality digital renderings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the muscle contours on the statueâ€™s arms, chest, and legs accurately shaded with smooth gradients that follow the underlying anatomy and directional light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The muscle contours on the statue in Image B are smoothly shaded, demonstrating a correct understanding of anatomical structure. The light source directionality is well-followed, with gradients adding depth and dimension that align with realistic lighting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the incense holders positioned at ground level around the base of the pedestal, correctly scaled, and free from floating or clipping against other structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no mention or visual presence of incense holders at the base of the pedestal. Therefore, based on the available visual information and common sculpture design, we can deduce that such elements are absent.",
