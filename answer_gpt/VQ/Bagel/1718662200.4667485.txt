    "Question": "Q1: Is the head of the pig significantly larger than the body without causing visible distortions in the neck or shoulder area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each pig illustration features a large head relative to its body, which is a common characteristic in chibi or cartoonish designs. This stylistic choice does not cause visible distortions in the neck or shoulder area due to the exaggerated proportions typical of such art styles.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the green sunglasses properly rendered with consistent color and reflective properties matching the original style, without unnatural edges or texture breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the green sunglasses on each pig are rendered with consistent color and texture. The vibrant green is uniform, and the shape is smooth without jagged edges. This matches the cartoon style, where exaggerated expressions and eye-wear are often used to enhance character personality.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the pig's hands on the turntable have five fingers each, with natural finger spacing and curvature that match typical animal anatomy?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pig illustrations show simplified hands with stubby fingers. This relates to the stylized artistic choice often seen in cartoon characters, where anatomical accuracy is sacrificed for simplicity and expressiveness. Therefore, neither human-like five fingers nor typical animal anatomy apply to these cartoonish renditions. Typically, cartoon animals may not follow realistic anatomical norms.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the watercolor background integrate smoothly with the pig and DJ equipment, showing no abrupt edges or conflicting lighting patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each pig illustration is complemented by a watercolor background. The transition between the background and the pig is smooth, with equal vibrancy maintaining uniformity. The watercolor approach provides a soft gradient without sharp edges or conflicting lighting patterns, in line with the playful tone of the artwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the chat bubbles and surrounding soundwave patterns clearly defined, free of jagged edges, and positioned without obstructing key features like the face or turntable?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chat bubbles and sound wave patterns are clearly defined with smooth curves. They are placed strategically around the pig figures without obstructing important elements such as the pigâ€™s face or DJ equipment. This careful positioning is typical in comic-style illustrations to ensure the viewer's attention remains on the focal points.",
