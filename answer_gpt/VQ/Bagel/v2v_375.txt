    "Question": "Q1: Do the chibi-style characters maintain natural proportions and avoid unnatural distortion in their body shapes?",
    "explanation": "Chibi-style characters are typically characterized by exaggerated features such as large heads and small bodies, which are considered natural in this style. In Image B, the characters indeed follow this style with proportionally large heads and smaller bodies, which aligns with the conventional chibi design approach. Therefore, the style follows its own natural logic, hence maintaining 'natural proportions' within the chibi context.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the overall composition of the image, including the chibi characters, horse-drawn carriage, and festive backdrop, remain structurally consistent and visually credible?",
    "explanation": "Image B incorporates a combination of chibi characters set in a context implying pre-modern European elements (carriage) side by side with traditional Chinese elements (outfits and backdrop).

However, in terms of a visually credible scene combining both disparate elements can lead to incohesiveness.",
