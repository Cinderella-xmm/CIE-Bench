    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal shards forming the wings symmetrically aligned and structurally coherent, without visible gaps, misaligned facets, or distorted geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal shards serving as wings appear to be symmetrically aligned with matching shapes and sizes on both sides. They follow an orderly pattern and have structurally coherent geometry with no visible gaps or misaligned facets. Given the precision and uniformity in their arrangement, I can conclude that the shards are aligned and coherent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the golden leafy strands follow the natural flow of the original hair and appear integrated without floating or disconnected sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the golden leafy strands are placed in alignment with the flow of the original hair movements. They appear to emerge naturally from the hair, integrating seamlessly without appearing to float or be disconnected from the hair itself. No visible signs indicate that the strands are separate or improperly integrated, suggesting a cohesive and harmonious inclusion.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the shirt display a uniform, soft velvet texture with natural shadowing and no repeating patterns or digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt looks consistent in texture and appears to have a soft, matte surface that is indicative of velvet. There are natural shadows that accompany the folds and curves of the shirt, adding depth. I do not observe any disrupting patterns or digital artifacts across its surface, indicating a smooth texture overall.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are all edited elements—crystal wings, leafy hair, and velvet shirt—properly aligned with the body and each other, without clipping, overlapping errors, or positional distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal wings, golden leafy hair, and velvet shirt appear correctly aligned with each other and the body's proportions. There is no evidence of clipping or overlapping errors, and each element fits coherently within the scene. Positional distortions are absent, suggesting a careful editing process to ensure alignment and proportionality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
