      "question": "Does the transformed tagine retain its original conical shape and base proportions, with no visible warping or deformation in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has transformed into a jeweled, ornate cup rather than retaining its tagine shape. The original conical form and base proportions of a tagine have completely changed, which means the structure is no longer preserved. The cup has a wide opening, handles, and is adorned with jewels, which further deviates from the original shape.",

      "question": "Are the arabesque patterns and gem-like details on the tagine's surface evenly rendered with consistent texture, lighting response, and material properties, without any visible seams or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ornate cup in Image B is elaborately embellished with gem-like details and intricate patterns, which appear to be evenly rendered. The textures, lighting response, and material properties seem consistent, as the jewels have a uniform sparkle and the patterns are intricate. There are no visible seams or unnatural highlights observable, denoting high-level craftsmanship in the depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the smoke emerging from the tagine smooth, translucent, and flowing naturally, with a clearly defined but soft-edged genie silhouette that does not exhibit jagged lines or digital distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smoke in Image B emerges in a mystical, flowing form that shapes into a genie silhouette. The transition is smooth and translucent, showcasing a defined shape with soft edges. There are no visible jagged lines or digital distortion present, suggesting a believable portrayal of the smoke.",

      "question": "Do the metallic threads and jewel-like elements on the fabric appear embedded within the textile weave, with realistic reflection and shadowing that matches the surrounding material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fabric beneath the ornate cup in Image B features jewel-like elements and metallic threads that give it a rich and embedded appearance within the weave. The reflection and shadowing are orchestrated realistically, complementing the surrounding material and consistent with the lighting direction, which enhances the fabricâ€™s opulence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the tagine and the smoke consistent with the light source direction, and do they properly interact with the fabric and surrounding environment without floating or misplaced areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast by the cup and the genie figure are coherent with the apparent light source direction. They interact well with the textile environment, maintaining a connection to the base fabric without appearing to float or being misplaced. This coherence suggests a well-executed lighting setup.",
