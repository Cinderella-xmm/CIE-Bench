    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the 3D printed display model and display plaque appear naturally integrated into the image, without disrupting the sceneâ€™s overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D printed model and the plaque seem to be well integrated into the scene based on their placement and the way the lighting and shadows are handled. They do not appear out of place or disproportionately aligned with the environment, suggesting a natural fit within the context of a tech expo setup.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the texture of the 3D printed model resemble matte PLA plastic realistically, without showing any unnatural surface irregularities or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture of the 3D printed model appears smooth and consistent, similar to what one would expect of a matte finish typical of PLA plastic materials. The surface does not display any unexpected irregularities or digital artifacts, maintaining a realistic appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the display plaque at the base positioned correctly, maintaining structural consistency and contributing to the visual credibility of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display plaque is placed at the base of the model, appearing horizontally aligned and structurally consistent with the 3D printed figure. Its placement and alignment contribute positively to the overall visual credibility, matching the common display setups at expos or exhibitions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the transition between the original elements and the new tech expo booth background appear seamless, avoiding any obvious artifacts or unnatural segmentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition between the components of the image, including the model, plaque, and background, is smooth. There are no visible lines or mismatches that would suggest unnatural segmentation or poor editing, indicating that the elements are integrated seamlessly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the 3D printed model and the display plaque realistic and consistent with what one would expect in a real-world scenario, avoiding any noticeable distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions of both the 3D printed model and the display plaque appear realistic and are consistent with typical sizes found in real-world exhibitions. There are no distortions in size or shape that would make the objects seem unrealistic when taken together or placed in the given scene.",
