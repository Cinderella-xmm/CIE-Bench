    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges of the jigsaw pieces smooth and interlocking without gaps or overlapping deformities?",
    "explanation": "The pieces in Image B exhibit typical jigsaw puzzle characteristics where each piece has defined interlocking edges designed to fit seamlessly together. The visual cues show the pieces laying flat with precise cuts allowing for a smooth fit without any noticeable gaps or overlapping deformities, typical in manufactured puzzles.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the dragon patterns appear in darker wood stain and the compass area in lighter wood stain, with no abrupt or unnatural color transitions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon patterns are stained in a darker shade, contrasting with the lighter wood stain of the compass area. This arrangement creates a distinct and natural transition that is visually coherent, which is a common design strategy to differentiate intricate designs like dragon patterns from the background or central elements such as the compass.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the wood grain texture visible and naturally varied across all puzzle pieces, without repeating patterns or artificial smoothing?",
    "explanation": "The wood grain texture in Image B appears naturally varied across different puzzle pieces, adding to the realistic appearance of wooden surfaces. The pieces show a range of patterns without obvious repetition or smoothing, mimicking natural wood grain variation rather than artificial replication, maintaining a natural look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the puzzle pieces arranged in a physically plausible scattered layout on the wooden surface, with no floating or overlapping pieces that defy gravity or perspective?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the puzzle pieces scattered in a natural and physically plausible manner on the wooden surface. Each piece lies flat, adhering to gravitational principles without any indication of floating or overlapping out of perspective, contributing to a realistic portrayal of a puzzle in progress.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the central compass retain its circular shape and fine internal details, with no distortion or loss of precision in the engraved lines and divisions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central compass maintains its circular shape and exhibits meticulously detailed engravings with precise lines and divisions. This indicates an attention to detail in preserving the design's intricacy without any visible distortion, ensuring the compass remains a coherent and focused element of the puzzle.",
    "answer": "Yes"
