      "question": "Does the broccoli appear structurally consistent and credible as a small real tree without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli is positioned on the forest floor, and its structure mimics that of a small tree partly due to its round top and stem-like base. The broccoli florets visually resemble dense foliage, commonly seen on forest trees. The texture of the broccoli appears realistic, consistent, and without any visible signs of artifacts or unnatural textures such as pixelation or distortion. Thus, it appears credible as a small tree.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the newly added forest floor support the broccoli as a small real tree in a way that appears physically logical and does not introduce distortions such as broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli rests on a forest floor consisting of organic elements such as soil and leaves. The forest floor appears natural and cohesive with the environment, and there are no visible geometric distortions or artifacts that would indicate a mismatch between the broccoli and its surroundings. The elements of the forest floor seem to blend well with the base of the broccoli, reinforcing its role as a tree.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the shadows and highlights on the broccoli consistent with sunlight filtering through a forest canopy, without creating unnatural lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to come from above, consistent with sunlight filtering through a forest canopy. The highlights on the broccoli correspond with this light source, with shadows naturally falling in areas where the light is obstructed. This lighting setup creates a believable forest ambiance without any harsh or unnatural lighting effects that would detract from the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the texture of the broccoli detailed enough to resemble a small tree trunk, avoiding unnatural smoothing or graininess?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The broccoli in Image B maintains its natural texture, with details such as the small florets and irregularities present on its surface. These details contribute to a resemblance of tree trunk textures, and there are no signs of excessive smoothing or graininess that would make it appear artificial or out of place as a tree trunk within the forest setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition harmonious, with the forest floor and background convincingly integrating with the broccoli as a tree, without any visual contradictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition in Image B presents a harmonious scene, where the broccoli convincingly resembles a small tree set against a forest backdrop. The forest floor and background are coherently integrated with the broccoli, with no stark contrasts or visual contradictions that would disrupt the continuity and realism of the scene. The blending of these elements provides a seamless visual narrative.",
