    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal facets on the truck's cabin and body uniformly shaped and aligned with the original panel lines, without visible breaks or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is represented as a crystal structure with visible facets and panel lines. These facets are aligned with the geometric shapes and lines of the original truck design as seen in Image A. Each segment of the cabin and body follows a clear, consistent pattern without misalignment. The facets mirror the contours and lines of the original truck, maintaining uniform shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the transparent quartz wheels maintain the same size, spacing, and axle alignment as the original muddy wheels, with no floating or misplaced components?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases the wheels as clear quartz structures that seem to mimic the size and spacing found in Image A. The alignment with the axles appears consistent, as there are no visible signs of the wheels floating or being misplaced. The spacing between each wheel matches that of the original truck in Image A, suggesting the adherence to the original design structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the quartz wheels internally detailed with natural-looking crystal lattice structures that follow the shape of the original hubs and rims, without jagged or inconsistent lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels are depicted with crystal-like characteristics, but they do not showcase complex internal lattice structures that mirror natural crystal patterns. Instead, they exhibit smooth surfaces without jagged or inconsistent lines. The original truck in Image A has regular wheel hubs and rims without intricate lattice designs.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the white marble platform flat, continuous, and properly supporting the entire underside of the crystal truck, with no visible gaps or floating sections?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the crystal truck placed on a white marble platform, which appears continuous and flat. The platform is seen supporting the entire underside of the truck's structure, with the absence of gaps or floating sections, suggesting effective support for the crystal truck.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the crystal surfaces display subtle color refraction and reflections consistent with emerald and jade materials, without unnatural glowing patches or excessive chromatic aberration?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses emerald-like colors on the crystal truck, showcasing subtle refractions and reflective characteristics typical of such gemstones. The surfaces display variations in color intensity and highlights without any unnatural glowing patches or excessive chromatic distortion, which aligns with the aesthetics of emerald and jade materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"
