    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the bust have a visibly coherent head-to-body proportion where the head is enlarged relative to the torso but remains structurally plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi style is characterized by an exaggerated head size compared to the body. This style often depicts characters with larger heads for a cute effect, but the proportions remain structurally plausible within the stylistic norms. The torso is smaller and simplified, which is typical for chibi figures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi style facial features are typically simplified yet clearly defined. Although specifics about missing features can't be assessed due to the blurred face, typically in chibi depictions, the features like eyes and mouths are simplified while still being recognizable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the embroidered patterns on the garment have a smooth, continuous appearance with the colorful threads appearing distinct. This suggests they are logically structured and without jagged edges or disruption, aligning with a typical chibi figure's detailed garment style.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows stripes on the headdress that are evenly spaced and consistent in coloration, with no noticeable color bleeding or misalignment. This demonstrates good design clarity and coherence, typical for crafted items like this type of figure.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pomegranate depicted is smooth and glossy, with highlights that are consistent with a shiny surface. These highlights don't distort its shape or create false reflections, indicating a realistic and high-quality design for a collectible figure.",
