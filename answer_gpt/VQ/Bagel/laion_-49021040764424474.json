    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the orange, black, and silver sections of the truck's body composed of clearly defined LEGO brick patterns with uniform size and alignment, avoiding blurred or inconsistent textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a truck model made from LEGO bricks. The truck's body parts, identified by their color scheme of orange, black, and silver, exhibit a consistent blocky texture characteristic of LEGO constructions. Each section is clearly defined with uniform brick sizes and alignment typical of LEGO models, thereby avoiding any blurred or inconsistent textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wheels consist of circular gray LEGO-style pieces with correct proportions and no deformation, maintaining a solid geometric structure without jagged edges or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels are constructed from LEGO-style pieces that are circular and gray, fitting the typical design of LEGO wheels. They maintain correct proportions relative to the truck model and appear without jagged edges or deformations, which is consistent with LEGO's manufacturing standards for a solid geometric form.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth, flat black LEGO tiles arranged in a regular grid pattern without gaps, overlaps, or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the truck bed is made up of smooth, flat LEGO tiles that are black and arranged neatly in a regular grid pattern. This arrangement is characteristic of LEGO models and does not show any gaps, overlaps, or misaligned edges, which indicates precise construction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO truck positioned securely on a flat white shelf with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does the shelf extend appropriately beneath the full width of the truck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the LEGO truck situated on a flat white shelf. The truck appears securely set on the surface, without any floating effects. The shelf is wide enough to support the entirety of the truck's width, as indicated by the truck fitting neatly upon it, suggesting stability and correct placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all major structural components such as the tailgate, side steps, and bumpers correctly reconstructed in LEGO form with accurate proportions and proper alignment to the rest of the truck body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The major structural elements like the tailgate, side steps, and bumpers in Image B are built using LEGO bricks. They are accurately represented, maintaining appropriate proportions and alignment relative to the rest of the truck model. This construction reflects typical LEGO design principles, ensuring these components integrate properly with the truckâ€™s overall structure.",
