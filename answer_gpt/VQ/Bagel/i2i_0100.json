      "question": "Are the edges of the sinks and cabinets accurately depicted without any broken or warped shapes in both the top-down and angled side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration uses clear and precise lines to depict the shapes of the sinks and cabinets, with defined edges and proper angularity in both the top-down and angled side views. The lack of any warping or broken lines indicates that the depiction of the components is accurate and intentional, following typical design conventions in technical drawings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the shadows and light reflections on the countertop, mirrors, and cabinetry appear natural and consistent with the lighting sources in both the top-down and angled side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks color and shading as it is a line drawing, thus it inherently does not depict shadows or light reflections naturalistically. Without visual cues indicating shadows or reflections, consistency with lighting sources cannot be determined in this graphic style.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the texture of the marble countertop and the finish of the white cabinetry remain clear and authentic in both the top-down and angled side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture and finish cannot be assessed as the image is a black-and-white line drawing. Line drawings tend to abstract real textures and finishes to focus on structural depiction; therefore, the authenticity of marble or cabinetry finishes is not represented here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the faucets and fixtures proportionate and correctly positioned relative to the sink basins in both the top-down and angled side views without any distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, faucets and fixtures appear accurately positioned and proportioned in relation to the sink basins. The line drawing clearly defines the placement of these elements, maintaining proportionality without visible distortions. Standard architectural drawing conventions support this analysis by emphasizing geometric correctness.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the layout of the top-down view and angled side view logically arranged and spaced to facilitate easy interpretation of the sink structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout in Image B is arranged with separate sink and cabinet views depicted distinctly, allowing for clear interpretation of structural elements. The spatial arrangement in technical drawings helps viewers understand dimensions and positions without confusion, as seen with the different views provided here.",
