      "question": "Does the fur texture on the side of the cat appear smooth and consistent with the texture on the front part without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat drawing depicts the fur with a stylized texture, characterized by bold lines and shading, which is typical for comic-style illustrations. This creates an appearance that is not necessarily smooth but consistent with the artistic style. Smoothness can be interpreted in this context as the smooth flow of lines and shading without irregularities, which seems consistent. World knowledge about artistic representation suggests that comic-style doesn't aim for photorealistic smoothness but for an expressive depiction without any unintended inconsistencies.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cat's front and side views proportionally aligned without any noticeable distortion or overlapping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the artistic style presents a single perspective of the cat, focusing on the front view in a typical 2D cartoon manner. This means there's no combination of front and side views within the same illustration, which avoids issues of disproportion or artifacts due to blending perspectives. In comic-style art, as seen here, the artist usually maintains consistent proportions to preserve the intended aesthetics.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cat's eyes and ears retain their natural shape and detail, free from any visible artifacts or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes and ears are styled in a simplified and bold fashion typical of comics, using distinct outlines and solid colors. The details are preserved clearly within this context, as there are no visible artifacts or blurring that affects their intended appearance. The shapes are deliberately drawn with clear boundaries and consistent styling, indicating an absence of visual distractions consistent with the style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a continuous and natural transition where the front and side views of the cat meet, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or awkward intersections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the cat only from a frontal perspective, as is customary in comic-style art forms. Therefore, there is no transition between front and side views in this image, and consequently, there is no opportunity for broken shapes or awkward intersections to occur. The drawing focuses solely on a front view, rendering the question of transition inapplicable.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall posture and positioning of the cat in the combined image remain plausible and natural, without introducing any unnatural bending or stretching of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the comic-style drawing presents a natural and plausible posture for the cat, seated and facing forward. The simplified artistic choice doesn't allow for detailed anatomical inaccuracies, and given the style, no unnatural bending or stretching of limbs is observable. The artist has captured a classic feline stance, maintaining recognizability and naturalness within the conventions of 2D character illustration.",
