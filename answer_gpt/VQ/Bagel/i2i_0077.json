        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures around the mirror appear to be smooth, consistent with natural stone or tile that would be found in a classically designed Roman-inspired bathhouse. Using world knowledge, the typical textures in a Roman bathhouse would include stone or stucco, which are evident here. There are no visible artifacts or disruptions in the texture around the mirror, indicating a seamless transformation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to be warm and consistent with what would be expected in a Roman bathhouse, which often used natural light augmented by candle or torchlight. There are no unnatural shadows or highlights that would suggest artificiality in the lighting setup. This indicates that the lighting is appropriate for the setting.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plant decor in Image B fits seamlessly with the Roman bathhouse style, as plants, particularly those common in the Mediterranean, were often used decoratively. The shapes and proportions of the plants appear natural and undistorted. This aligns with historical decor practices in Roman architecture, contributing to the harmonious aesthetics of the space.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The faucet in Image B is visually consistent with elements seen in Roman-inspired architecture, using a material that suggests wrought iron or aged brass, which would be typical of Roman utility design. The faucet is neither out-of-place nor distorted within the context of a Roman bathhouse, maintaining stylistic consistency with the overall design.",
