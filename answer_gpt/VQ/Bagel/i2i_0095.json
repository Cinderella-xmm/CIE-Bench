      "question": "Does the word 'Shine' appear seamlessly integrated into the mirror with no visible artifacts or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Shine' is presented as if it is part of the mirror itself, with a glowing effect that mimics neon signage. The text appears to be even and well-defined, with the glow around the letters adding to the effect. The edges are clean, and no digital artifacts or jagged lines are apparent, which suggests a seamless integration. The uniformity of the text and the absence of visible irregularities contribute to the perception that it is naturally part of the mirror's surface, rather than an artificial overlay.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the style and glow effect of the word 'Shine' consistent with the aesthetic of the bathroom and does not look out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bathroom depicted in Image B features a modern and minimalistic design with clean lines and neutral colors. The word 'Shine', presented in a bright and stylish font with a warm glow, complements the sophisticated ambiance of the interior. The warm hue of 'Shine' contrasts gently with the surrounding neutral tones yet aligns harmoniously with the aesthetic theme. This kind of accent is often used to enhance modern settings without overwhelming them, indicating consistency with the overall design scheme.",

      "question": "Does the addition of the word 'Shine' maintain the mirror's original shape and proportions, avoiding any geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, it is clear that the mirror retains its rectangular shape and original proportions, and there's no observable warping or stretching of the mirror's edges due to the addition of the word 'Shine'. The text is placed within the bounds of the mirror without affecting its geometry, which suggests that the mirror's shape and proportions are preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the reflective properties of the mirror undisturbed by the addition of 'Shine', preserving the clarity and detail of the mirrorâ€™s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror still retains its reflective surface, showing the text as an addition on top rather than interfering with its reflective quality. The glow around 'Shine' gives a neon light impression, and while it adds brightness, it does not obscure or damage the reflective clarity of the mirror surface. There are no disturbances or cloudiness apparent on the mirror due to the word 'Shine'.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the positioning, size, and lighting of the word 'Shine' seem authentic, enhancing rather than detracting from the visual credibility of the bathroom setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The placement of 'Shine' on the mirror in Image B feels deliberate and well thought out. It is centered and proportionally scaled to fit within the mirror's boundary without overwhelming it. The lighting effect appears balanced, not overpowering the ambient light of the room. This strategic positioning and appropriate luminosity contribute to an authentic look, enhancing rather than detracting from the overall aesthetic of the bathroom setting.",
