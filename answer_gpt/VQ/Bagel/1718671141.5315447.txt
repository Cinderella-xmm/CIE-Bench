    "Question": "Q1: Are the brass gears and copper funnels added to the building's exterior consistent in material appearance, showing realistic metallic reflections and surface details without artificial or pixelated textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brass gears and copper funnels exhibit realistic metallic reflections and detailed surface textures consistent with their materials. They display appropriate highlights and shadowing typical of metal surfaces, without any visible pixelation or artificial textures. This suggests a high-quality rendering with attention to achieving a realistic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the clock faces on the observatory dome maintain correct proportions and alignment with the spherical shape, with no visible warping or bending of clock numerals or hands?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not directly present the observatory dome or clock faces. It focuses on steampunk elements including gears and a visible clock. Analyzing the clock, the numerals and hands appear correctly proportioned without warping, indicating proper rendering without distortion, but the absence of a rounded dome shape means direct analysis of dome proportions isn't applicable here.",
    "answer": "Not applicable"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the steam emanating from the structure appear volumetric and translucent, rising naturally from vents without abrupt edges or unnatural clustering?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, steam is visible emanating from multiple vents. It shows volumetric properties with a translucent appearance, correctly simulating natural dispersal into the air. The edges of steam plumes are soft and lack any abruptness, contributing to a realistic effect without unnatural clustering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ornamental metal details on the observatory dome continuous and properly scaled, with no gaps, overlapping errors, or jagged edges suggesting incomplete rendering?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents architectural features with ornamental steampunk details like gears and a clock. These elements are well integrated into the structure without gaps or overlapping errors. They scale correctly relative to the building's overall size and show clean edges, indicating complete rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the reflection of the building in the water a symmetrical and undistorted mirror image of the edited structure, including all added steampunk elements such as gears, clock faces, and steam vents?",
    "explanation": "The image does not contain water reflections or an identifiable observatory structure beyond steampunk elements. Thus, analysis of reflections in Image B isn't applicable, as it doesn't present a scenario with water to evaluate mirror image accuracy of the structure.",
    "answer": "Not applicable"
