      "question": "Do the trench coats and fedoras on all characters have natural fabric draping and proper fit without visible distortion or clipping against limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the trench coats and fedoras worn by the characters show a natural fit, with the fabric draping properly over the bodies without visible distortion. The coats fall naturally and follow the contours of the bodies, and the fedoras sit correctly on the heads without clipping against the limbs. This realistic depiction suggests careful attention to detail in rendering.",

      "question": "Is the grayscale foggy cityscape background smoothly blended with the characters, showing consistent atmospheric perspective and no sharp boundaries or lost architectural details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grayscale foggy cityscape forms a cohesive backdrop for the characters. The atmospheric perspective is consistent, creating depth without sharp boundaries where the characters and background meet. Architectural details remain visible despite the fog, enhancing the sense of realism within the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the central character’s hand holding the magnifying glass show five fingers with natural curvature and grip, and is the magnifying glass proportionally sized and positioned as if being used realistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the central character’s hand holding the magnifying glass appears with only four visible fingers. The positioning and grip seem somewhat natural, but it does not show all five fingers, which questions the completeness and realism of the image. The magnifying glass is proportionally sized, but the missing finger affects the overall realism.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the eyepatch on the central character’s face aligned with his facial structure and consistently shaded with the surrounding skin and lighting, without appearing detached or unnaturally bright/dark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyepatch aligns well with the central character’s facial contours in Image B. It is shaded consistently with the surrounding skin, neither too bright nor too dark, thus integrating naturally within the overall lighting of the scene. This attention to detail ensures the eyepatch appears as part of the character.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title ‘Whispers of Shadows’ and subtitle ‘A Mysterious Journey’ are presented in a serif font at the top. The text is properly spaced, ensuring readability without overlapping any elements in the scene. This careful placement maintains the visual clarity and appeal of the title.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the blood-red streaks along the edges of the book are smoothly rendered. The color intensity is uniform, and there are no visible artifacts like jagged edges or noise, contributing to a clean and polished appearance. This indicates a high level of detail and quality in rendering these elements.",
