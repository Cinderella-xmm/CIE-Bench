    "Question": "Q1: Is the glass dome enclosing the lantern transparent and smooth, with no visible distortions, cracks, or unnatural refraction patterns that disrupt the perception of depth or clarity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome appears transparent and smooth. The dome shows clear visibility of the objects enclosed within it, such as the miniature marketplace setup. Typically, glass domes intended for display are designed to be distortion-free to offer unimpeded views of their contents, which aligns with its purpose. Therefore, there are no visible distortions or disruptive refraction patterns in the glass dome.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the scaled-down ceramic street pavements composed of clearly defined, uniformly sized tiles with accurate color transitions and no blurred or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the street pavements are made up of small, evenly sized tiles. Each tile has clearly defined edges and distinct colors that transition smoothly without blur between different tiles. Such miniature scenes require precise detailing to maintain realism, and this image successfully showcases that."
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the textile merchants and their fabric canopies proportionally small compared to the lantern, with realistic shapes and textures that do not appear stretched, duplicated, or unnaturally fused with other elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature marketplace under the glass dome features textile merchants and their fabric canopies. These elements are proportionally small compared to other objects in the scene and particularly smaller than a typical lantern object. They display realistic shapes and textures typical of small figurines or models, without signs of digital stretching, duplication, or any form of unnatural fusion, supporting a cohesive miniature environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the palm trees have properly shaped fronds, rooted bases, and consistent shadows that align with the light source from the lantern, without appearing flat or detached from the ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees appear within the enclosed miniature scene. They have well-defined fronds and appear securely rooted to the base. Given the multiple light sources typically seen in such miniature designs, palm shadows appear consistent with artificial indoor light setups. However, this might include shadows rendered without direct alignment with the lantern, and such scenes often create their internal lighting logic, rather than strictly aligning every shadow with a single light source like a lantern.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the base of the dome feature a textured, weathered surface with subtle variations in tone and depth, free from uniform patterns or digital artifacts that suggest over-processing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the dome showcases a textured and layered effect. It gives the appearance of a weathered surface with natural tone variations, mimicking realistic wear and environmental exposure. The design avoids uniform pattern repetition that might indicate digital over-processing, maintaining a believable miniature environment appearance with surface depth and detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
