      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the tallest tower on the left retain its original vertical structure and proportional height after being modified with robotic limb features, without any visible stretching, compression, or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the modification introduces a large robotic figure with a central eye and extended limbs, which replaces the tallest tower seen in Image A. The towering structure's original verticality and overall height proportions in the scene may be distorted due to these modifications. The integration of these features potentially disrupts the continuity typically expected of a skyscraper. Given the context of modification with significantly different features, it seems unlikely that it retains its original structure without distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the neon circuitry patterns on the EMAAR building and nearby towers smoothly integrated into the facade without visible line breaks, uneven spacing, or unnatural color gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays neon circuitry patterns applied to various building facades. These patterns are generally well-aligned with the architecture, maintaining even spacing and smooth integration with the building structures. Such designs typically follow clean lines and consistent illumination quality, creating a futuristic visual appeal, indicating successful integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the scale-like panels on the dark glass towers exhibit uniform texture and reflection behavior, with no repeating patterns or distorted shapes suggesting low-quality rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark glass towers might feature design changes and additions involving sci-fi elements. While scale-like patterns could pose a challenge due to their repetitiveness, the image does not exhibit signs of distortion or low-quality rendering typically characterized by noticeable pattern repetitions or texture inconsistencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the glowing expressway spines maintain realistic width and curvature throughout their length, connecting logically to surrounding roads and showing no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The expressway structures in Image B involve bright glowing pathways supplementing futuristic enhancements. They maintain consistent curvature and width and appear logically connected to the depicted environment, integrating seamlessly with road-like elements without floating or disjointed segments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fin-like structures added to the tops of the buildings properly aligned with the rooflines and scaled appropriately, without appearing detached or structurally unstable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fin-like additions on the building tops in Image B seem carefully integrated into the skyline, aligning well with rooftops. These elements do not appear excessively large or detached, presenting a stable and intentional design enhancement consistent with futuristic architectural trends.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the holographic eye-like elements located on top of major towers clearly defined with smooth light emission and no visible digital artifacts such as aliasing or double images?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features eye-like holographic elements on towers that emit light uniformly. They appear as cohesive parts of the towers with smooth emission, typically avoiding common digital artifacts such as aliasing or ghosting effects. The clarity of these elements reflects high-quality rendering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all illuminated windows, signs, and architectural details (e.g., on the EMAAR building and VOCO tower) sharp and legible, with no visible blurring or degradation from the editing process?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image editing in Image B does not affect the sharpness or legibility of lit windows, signs, or architectural details. Features such as building names, logos, and lights appear clear and distinct, indicating effective editing preservation in terms of detail and sharpness.",
