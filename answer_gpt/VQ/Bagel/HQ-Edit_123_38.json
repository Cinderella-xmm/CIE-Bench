      "question": "Does the brushstroke effect cover the figure evenly without disrupting the outline of limbs, head, or torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the figure has a clean silhouette that is defined by a distinct brushstroke effect. The outlining is smooth, and the contours of the limbs, head, and torso are clearly maintained without any unevenness or disruptions that would indicate a disturbance in the brushstroke application. This suggests that the brushstroke effect covers the figure evenly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the enlarged hands anatomically accurate with five fingers each, and do they maintain natural joint alignment and skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual representation is artistic, focusing on a silhouette style rather than detailed anatomical accuracy. The figure is shown in a stylized, flat form without detailed features such as individual fingers or joint articulation. Hence, such anatomical accuracy regarding fingers and detailed skin texture is not applicable to this silhouette.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the elongated legs form a continuous, curved line from the hips to the feet without abrupt bends or discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents a highly stylized silhouette of a gymnast. The legs in this artistic depiction appear as a continuous and smooth curved line, suggesting fluid movement and grace typical of gymnastic poses. There are no unnatural bends or discontinuities evident within the silhouette depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the blue and silver gradients smoothly blended across the leotard and skin, without visible banding or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the graphic nature of Image B, there are no color gradients, leotard details, or realistic skin representation; instead, the color is uniformly applied across the silhouette in a solid blue shade. Since no gradient blending or specific highlights are depicted in this silhouette, the question of blending does not arise.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the swirling ribbons and stars placed around the figure in a manner that follows the direction of movement and does not intersect with the body or balance beam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image showcases swirling ribbons and stars as decorative elements surrounding the silhouetted gymnast. These elements are artistically arranged to complement the figure's movement direction. None of these decorative elements intersect with the silhouette itself, maintaining clear boundaries between them.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the matt-finish panel with rounded corners fully visible around the image, without cutting off any part of the gymnast or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction is of a gymnast within a defined area that is bordered by simple, clean lines and rounded corners suggestive of a panel. The silhouette and decorative elements fit well within this space, with no visible cropping or cutting off of the figure or associated graphics, ensuring full visibility around it.",
