      "question": "Does the schematic outline of the wallet maintain accurate proportions and closed geometric shapes without jagged edges or missing lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a schematic representation of a wallet. The wallet appears to have accurate proportions, with its shape reflecting a typical wallet design. The lines defining the edges and compartments are complete and do not show jagged edges or missing parts, which suggests well-maintained geometric integrity of the shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lines forming the wallet’s schematic structure uniformly thin, continuous, and free of smudges or inconsistent thickness that suggest texture or artifact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The schematic lines in Image B are thin, continuous, and uniformly drawn. They lack any indication of texture or artifact, maintaining a consistent thickness throughout, which is typical of a digital schematic design focused on clarity and precision.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the text annotations for “USD,” “QAR,” and “INR” placed adjacent to their respective banknote slots without overlapping the notes or distorting the wallet’s layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text annotations 'USD,' 'QAR,' and 'INR' are placed in proximity to their respective representations. However, they do not overlap the banknotes or alter the design of the wallet. Their placement is adjacent, maintaining the separation and clarity in the layout as expected.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The exchange rate charts and economy icons in Image B are displayed in a balanced manner. They are horizontally and vertically aligned, contributing to a cohesive and organized visual presentation.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the visible banknotes, including USD $20, QAR 10, and INR 50, are presented with clear denominations and readable text. There are no signs of stretching, blurring, or pixelation; thereby, they maintain their design and intact appearance.",
