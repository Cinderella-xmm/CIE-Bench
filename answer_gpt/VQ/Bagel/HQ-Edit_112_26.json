      "question": "Does the isometric representation of the figurine box maintain consistent angles and edges without distorted or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the figurine box displays consistent angles and edges that align well with isometric principles. The straight lines and regular corners suggest a construction without distortion. My knowledge of box design indicates that well-defined geometry in merchandising is essential for visual appeal and structure, leading to a conclusion that the isometric presentation preserves integrity without showing skewed or broken elements.",

      "question": "Are the floral-themed accents on the figurine box proportionally sized and textured in a way that matches the material and style of the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral accents are designed with proportionate sizing and detailing that complements the overall aesthetic of the box. The flowers, with their soft detailing and appropriate color saturation, match both the theme and style of the box, likely printed on a standard cardboard material. Common understanding of product decoration suggests that theme consistency enhances visual appeal and branding, hence the accents are well-integrated.",

      "question": "Is the chibi cat figure positioned correctly within the box, with its body fully contained and aligned with the interior space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the chibi cat figure positioned centrally within the box, with its features fully contained within the interior boundaries. The cat appears proportionate to the space, which reflects on my understanding of packaging aesthetics where the figure should not only fit but also showcase well. Such alignment demonstrates careful design consideration for both packaging and display purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the eyes of the chibi cat exhibit smooth, uniform glass-like reflection without visible pixelation or irregular highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi cat's eyes reveal a strikingly smooth and uniform glass-like quality in their reflection. The highlights are consistent with that of a polished surface, avoiding any irregular shapes or pixelation, which suggests expert rendering. Knowledge of reflective materials indicates that proper light handling is critical in maintaining the visual appeal and realism of glass surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the fur texture of the realistic cat figure beside the box show consistent flow and detail comparable to the original catâ€™s fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The realistic cat in Image A shows finely detailed fur with a natural flow, while Image B's chibi interpretation inherently loses realism for stylization purposes. Therefore, the chibi fur doesn't exhibit the same intricate detail and flow as found originally. This consistent simplification aligns with common practices in stylized figurine design, where essential features are exaggerated for effect.",
