    "Question": "Q1: Does the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo appear smooth and well-integrated without any unnatural edges or blurring around it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo is affixed to the top edge of the refrigerator. Analyzing the visual cues, such as the contour and color matching, can help determine integration. The logo appears to be well-placed without evident jagged edges or blurring, indicating careful editing. World knowledge about logo placement suggests that smooth integration is crucial for visual harmony, supporting the perception that this logo is seamlessly integrated.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the custom label on the top shelf placed appropriately, without distorting the surrounding items or creating visual inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the custom label is located at the top shelf inside the refrigerator next to several items like a jar and bowl. Examining the spatial positioning and alignment can reveal if any distortions occur. The label fits the shelf space well, maintaining proportions and alignment with adjacent objects, suggesting no distortion or misalignment. Based on world knowledge, proper placement typically involves logical alignment with surrounding items, confirming that the label is appropriately placed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the texture and details around the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label consistent with the rest of the refrigerator's surface, avoiding any noticeable loss or alteration?",
    "explanation": "Texture and detail consistency require a close examination of the surfaces where the logo and label are attached. The refrigerator surfaces around the logo in Image B show uniform texture and detail, mirroring the original applianceâ€™s finish. For the label, consistency with shelf items is essential. Given that both elements blend well, without disparate textures or finishes, the consistency is maintained according to practical design principles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the proportions of the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label maintain appropriate scaling relative to their surrounding elements, appearing neither too large nor too small?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the proportions requires comparing the size of the logo and label with nearby elements like the refrigerator structure and shelf contents. The logo and label do not overwhelm these elements nor appear diminutive, fitting naturally within their positions. Common sense dictates that balanced proportions should enhance visual appeal and coherence, which is evident in the scaling observed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the lighting and shadowing on the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label correspond logically to the light source, contributing to a natural and authentic appearance?",
    "explanation": "Lighting and shadowing should align with the overhead light source visible in the image. Observing Image B, the logo and label show coherent lighting effects consistent with the direction and intensity expected from the ambient light. Appropriate shading helps elements appear naturally integrated. According to world knowledge on lighting in images, such logical correspondence is key for authenticity, which is effectively achieved here.",
    "answer": "Yes"
