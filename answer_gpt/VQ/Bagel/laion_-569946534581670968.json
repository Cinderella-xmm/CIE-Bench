      "question": "Do the plush toy versions of the chicken wings retain the correct anatomical shape and proportions of real wings, such as the joint areas and wing tips, without deformation or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toys resemble a simplified and abstract version of chicken wings. Real chicken wings have distinct anatomical features such as joint areas and wing tips with specific proportions. The plush toys, however, are sewn pieces of fabric that are shaped in a very simplified manner, lacking the detailed anatomical features of actual chicken wings. They are more rounded and lack precise joint indication, which is common in plush designs due to the nature of soft, filled fabric not adhering to strict anatomical structures. Therefore, they do not retain the correct proportions or features of real chicken wings.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bright orange pillow placed inside the white bowl properly scaled and shaped to fit within the bowl's boundaries without bulging or distorting the bowlâ€™s edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based solely on Image B, the bright orange pillow is placed on a flat surface and is not inside a bowl. The edited image shows the pillow in close proximity to the plush toys, with no interaction with a bowl as there is no visual evidence of a bowl in the given image. Therefore, there is no scenario in Image B where the pillow is inside a bowl, and thus, it cannot be assessed for scaling or fit within bowl boundaries.",

      "question": "Does the light-colored wooden surface appear uniformly smooth with natural wood grain patterns and no visible digital artifacts or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden surface appears smooth and consistent in color, displaying subtle wood grain patterns expected in natural wood surfaces. The visual quality indicates no obvious digital artifacts or abrupt color shifts, which suggests a well-maintained, realistic wood appearance typically seen in photographs of wooden textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the golden-brown fabric of the plush wings display a subtle raised or granular texture that visually suggests a crunchy feel, while remaining consistent with the appearance of soft textile material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plush wings in Image B have a surface that is visibly made of fabric. The fabric does not display a texture suggesting crunchiness, as it appears smooth and plush as expected from stuffed fabric materials. The texture is consistent with soft textiles and does not visually mimic a crunchy feel, which would require a more rigid and patterned texture.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the orange pillow positioned in the same location relative to the plate and wings as the original sauce was, maintaining proper alignment and depth without overlapping or floating above the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange pillow is placed on a wooden surface next to the plush toys and not interacting with any plate, wings, or sauce. Comparing this with Image A is unnecessary as the positioning described in Image B, where the pillow does not relate to any plate or wings, indicates it is not aligned or placed in any manner similar to the sauce in the original image.",
