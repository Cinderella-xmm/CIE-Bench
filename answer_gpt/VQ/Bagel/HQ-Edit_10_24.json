        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress is redesigned to resemble a flower, with petals forming the dress's skirt.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds in Image B, surrounding areas like the writing space, have been crafted with rounded, soft edges and subtle gradations of shading.
