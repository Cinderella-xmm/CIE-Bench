      "question": "Are the enlarged head of the boy and the shrunken birds proportionate and structurally coherent, avoiding any noticeable distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual is a chibi-style illustration, which naturally involves exaggerated features like larger heads and smaller bodies. This style often includes simplification and exaggeration for charm and does not follow realistic proportions. The enlarged head and shrunken birds are part of this stylized depiction; therefore, they fit the stylistic coherence without appearing distorted within the context of chibi art.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Do the shrunken birds retain their fine details and textures naturally, without losing clarity or appearing pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the chibi art style, the birds are simplified into basic forms and bright colors without intricate details typical of realistic illustrations. This style prioritizes simplicity over texture, hence they do not appear pixelated as the detail levels are intentionally lower. The design remains clear and clean though less detailed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B is typical of the chibi style where the exaggerated head size is a key feature. The arrangement of elements, including the boy and three birds on his head and shoulders, aligns well with chibi art schemes, providing balance and continuity in an engaging way. Despite the surreal proportions, the art style credibly accommodates the visual elements.",
