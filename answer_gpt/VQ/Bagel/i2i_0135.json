      "question": "Does the right-side skier maintain a natural texture and appearance without visible artifacts where he appears to slide out of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right-side skier has been subject to a blur effect that results in a notable degradation of natural texture. This effect causes the skier to appear as though they are sliding out, resulting in visible artifacts. The natural details and textures are lost due to this motion blur effect, indicating a loss in the original quality of the skier's appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the right-side skier's body and equipment preserved, avoiding any distortion or unnatural bending in the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sliding effect applied in Image B has caused significant distortion in the geometric shapes of the right-side skier's body and equipment. The strong blur is evident around the edges of the skier’s limbs and equipment, leading to unnatural bending. Such distortion undermines the clear definition of the skier’s form and indicates compromised geometric integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shadow cast by the right-side skier remain consistent with the light source and appear naturally elongated or altered appropriately due to the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skier's shadow is present but does not appear to have been altered to be consistent with the sliding effect. The shadow remains sharp and unblurred, contradicting the apparent motion of the skier, which suggests an inconsistency with the light source and the altered position of the skier.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the snow texture around the right-side skier smooth and uninterrupted, without showing signs of unnatural blending or disruption from the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow texture surrounding the right-side skier in Image B is disrupted by the sliding effect, creating an unnatural blending at the point of the blur transition. The motion blur causes an overlap that disrupts the continuity and smoothness of the snow, making it appear unnaturally combined with the motion of the skier.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the details on the right-side skier's clothing, ski poles, and skis remain sharp and clear, without any blurring or loss of detail due to the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a significant amount of blurring applied to the details of the right-side skier's clothing, ski poles, and skis. This effect leads to a noticeable loss of detail, causing the items to lose their sharpness and clarity. The motion blur diminishes the fine details, which results in a less clear depiction compared to Image A.",
