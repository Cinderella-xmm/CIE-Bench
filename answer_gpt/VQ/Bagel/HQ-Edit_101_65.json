      "question": "Does the transformed tapestry gown maintain continuous and coherent fabric folds and draping without visible seams or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tapestry gown appears to have intricate design patterns, which are smoothly incorporated into the gown's fabric, giving an impression of high-quality craftsmanship. The fabric folds and draping are continuous and coherent, maintaining a natural flow without any visible seams or distorted geometry. This analysis is based on the visual perception of the gown in the image where the patterns seamlessly integrate into the overall design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the platinum jewelry pieces (necklace, earrings, bangles) proportionally accurate and free from unnatural glares, misshapen forms, or inconsistent material textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jewelry pieces such as the necklace, earrings, and bangles are visually consistent in terms of proportion and symmetry. They do not exhibit any unnatural glares or misshapen forms. The material texture appears uniform, maintaining the appearance of high-quality platinum which is usually associated with a shiny, smooth surface. This is evaluated by observing the light reflections and detailing on each piece of jewelry.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the newly added elements in the background (stars, luminous flowers, lanterns) follow consistent lighting direction and depth cues without creating visual inconsistencies or floating objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the added background elements such as stars, luminous flowers, and lanterns have consistent lighting direction and depth cues. The stars and lanterns have a luminous quality that fits harmoniously within the scene, suggesting light sources that influence surrounding elements naturally. These background elements do not appear to be floating or disconnected from the environment, suggesting attention to depth and spatial coherence.",

      "question": "Are both hands correctly formed with five fingers each, natural joint alignment, and no overlapping or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observation of Image B, both hands are depicted with five fingers each and show natural joint alignment. There are no missing or overlapping digits, and the positioning of the hands appears anatomically correct. This is assessed by analyzing the shape and alignment of each finger relative to the hand, ensuring they reflect natural human anatomy.",

      "question": "Do the luminous flowers and ethereal lanterns exhibit smooth gradients and soft glows without jagged edges or artificial halos?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminous flowers and ethereal lanterns in Image B display smooth gradients and soft glows. There are no jagged edges or artificial halos around these elements, contributing to a cohesive and visually appealing background. The lighting effects around the flowers and lanterns enhance the ethereal aesthetic of the image, indicating a careful blend of colors and light intensity.",
