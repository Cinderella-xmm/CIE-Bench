      "question": "Does the cat maintain natural proportions and anatomical structure without visible stretching, compression, or deformation in the shadow box scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is positioned within a shadow box scene, sitting regally on a throne. The cat's proportions still appear natural, maintaining the usual anatomical structure seen in domestic cats. Its legs, body, and head do not show any signs of distortion or disproportion that would suggest stretching or compression. Through visual cues, combined with common knowledge of cat anatomy, one can discern that the image artistically captures the essence of a cat without altering its natural form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the materials of the settee (velvet and wood) rendered with realistic textures and consistent lighting, showing no signs of pixelation, mismatched shading, or artificial seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a settee similar to Image A; instead, it features a shadowbox scene with a throne-like chair, which seems to use different materials. Thus, as Image B does not include a settee with velvet and wood materials, there are no specific textures, shading, or potential errors to assess in this context of Image B.",

      "question": "Do the velvet curtains appear physically plausible with correct fold patterns, soft shadows, and seamless integration into the background without floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the velvet curtains have realistic fold patterns along with soft shadows that lend them depth and dimension. They are well-integrated into the background, exhibiting no signs of floating or misalignment. These visual cues, combined with knowledge of how velvet and drapery typically behave, lead to the conclusion that the curtains are depicted in a plausible and realistic manner.",

      "question": "Are the gilded columns properly scaled, positioned with correct perspective, and rendered with reflective metallic surfaces that match the ambient light without artifacts like blurring or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gilded columns in Image B are appropriately scaled and positioned, creating a balanced perspective within the shadowbox scene. The reflective metallic surfaces are consistent with the ambient light, showing no irregularities like blurring or jagged edges. These observations suggest that the columns are accurately rendered, leveraging knowledge of perspective in miniature scenes and metallic texture portrayal.",

      "question": "Are the hanging mouse portraits clearly visible, correctly sized relative to the scene, and mounted with realistic shadows and string attachments without visual glitches or texture errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hanging mouse portraits are visible and appear to be properly sized relative to the overall scene in the shadow box. Each portrait is mounted with realistic shadows and strings that add depth to their placement on the walls, maintaining seamless integration and free of texture errors or visual glitches. Visual cues combined with common understanding of interior decorations inform this conclusion.",
