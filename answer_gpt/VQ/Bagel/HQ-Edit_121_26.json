    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the ornate armor on the character's torso and limbs have consistent geometric structure and natural surface textures without visible distortion or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor appears to have a coherent geometric structure, following the natural curvature of the body. The texture is consistent, mimicking metal with ornate designs, and there are no visible distortions or broken edges. This suggests meticulous attention to detail in the rendering of the metalwork.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the gem-studded scepter proportionally accurate and physically plausible in size and shape relative to the character’s hand, with no distorted or misaligned gemstones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scepter in Image B is designed to be proportional to the character’s hand, following a plausible size that one might expect for a ceremonial or royal accessory. The gemstones are uniformly integrated within the design, accurately positioned without distortion or misalignment, highlighting a detailed digital rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the velvet cape exhibit natural draping behavior with realistic folds and shadows, and does it avoid unnatural intersections or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The velvet cape displays realistic draping, as evidenced by the folds and shadows that mimic natural fabric behavior. The imagery avoids any unnatural intersections or floating segments, capturing an authentic representation of a heavy, flowing fabric.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rolling hills and distant castle are smoothly integrated into the background. The lighting and shadows align consistently across the scene, avoiding any sharp edges or color discontinuities, which creates a cohesive and harmonious visual landscape.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character’s right hand holding the scepter show five correctly shaped fingers with natural joint alignment and skin texture, without deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character’s right hand in Image B is depicted with five fingers that are correctly shaped, showcasing natural joint alignment and realistic skin texture. There is no evidence of deformation or extra digits, indicating a detailed and anatomically correct representation.",
