      "question": "Is the watch communicator on the plaid tie positioned naturally within the fabric, with consistent color, texture, and lighting that match the surrounding material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch communicator appears visually integrated into the plaid tie, suggesting intentional design placement. The match in color and the consistent shadows indicate a cohesive integration, likely mimicking fabric realism. Analyzing Image A, the plaid tie does not contain such a feature. Comparing both, Image B's integration retains an aspect of realism and deliberate placement, suggesting a 'Yes' response.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the camera lens embedded in the emblem on the right suit’s lapel aligned with the pattern and fabric, showing no gaps, misaligned edges, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera lens appears as part of the emblem on the lapel but lacks seamless integration with the fabric, showing edges and highlights that seem digitally added. Image A depicts a pin or emblem without such a lens, indicating an external addition in Image B. Thus, Image B's lack of natural alignment suggests a 'No' response.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the thought bubbles and dialogue text clearly separated from the characters’ faces and clothing, with clean lines and no overlap or distortion of nearby features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B’s thought bubbles and dialogue text float above the characters with clear delineation from clothing and faces, indicating effective separation. Lines are sharp, with no evidence of overlapping or distortion. Closely inspecting Image B, the work appears clean, with the text and bubbles positioned distinctly away from facial and clothing elements, ensuring clarity and separation. Therefore, the conclusion is 'Yes'.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the characters’ necks and shoulders retain natural proportions and smooth contours, without stretched, compressed, or fragmented shapes after anthropomorphization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the characters are depicted in a cartoonish style, their necks and shoulders maintain consistent proportions without any apparent stretching or compressing. The drawn style naturally accommodates contour shifts, maintaining smooth transitions across body lines. Reviewing Image A, natural human proportions are evident, supporting that transformations in Image B do not distort anthropomorphized features. This leads to a 'Yes' conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the grassy field and sky background free from distortion, noise, or color inconsistencies that suggest digital manipulation or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B’s background appears smooth without evident artifacts or manipulation traits. The grassy field and sky feature consistent colors and textures, serving as a cohesive background for the characters without noticeable digital interruption. Comparing with Image A's realistic texture, Image B keeps an equivalent quality and continuity in the background visuals, deducing a 'Yes' answer.",
