      "question": "Do the blue-purple neon lights on the keyboard seamlessly blend with the surrounding environment, avoiding any unnatural glow or oversaturation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon lights appear to illuminate the keyboard without causing oversaturation. The blend of blue and purple hues seems well-integrated with the surroundings, creating a visually appealing effect. The surrounding environment maintains a consistent lighting tone without abrupt changes that typically indicate unnatural glow.",

      "question": "Are the glowing fingertips free of unnatural textures, keeping the hands' structure realistic and preserving the natural texture and curvature of the fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the fingertips glowing with blue and purple neon lights. Despite this effect, the curvature and detail of the fingers remain realistic. The texture on the hands does not appear distorted or unnatural, maintaining lifelike features even under altered lighting conditions.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the keyboard retain its original shape and functionality, with no visible distortion or breaking of keys despite the addition of neon lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keyboard in Image B reflects neon lighting, but the structure and alignment of the keys are consistent, showing no distortion. The keys' positions and spacing remain intact, suggesting that the neon overlay hasn't compromised the keyboard's shape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the details on the laptopâ€™s surface and key caps preserved their sharpness, with no blurring or pixelation caused by the added neon effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the details of the laptop's surface and key caps appear sharp and well-defined. The neon lighting does not introduce blurring or pixelation, allowing the texture and edges of the keys to remain clear.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the blue-purple neon lights on the keyboard interact correctly with the rest of the scene's lighting, creating believable reflections or shadows where appropriate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon lights are seen to project plausible reflections and shadows on the keyboard and surrounding areas. The distribution of light aligns with typical light interactions, showing reasonable illumination effects such as shadows under the keys and subtle reflections.",
