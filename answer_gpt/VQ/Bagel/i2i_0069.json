      "question": "Does the holographic projection screen emerge naturally from the phone without disrupting the visual flow of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a holographic projection screen is added to the scene with the sandwich and the knife. The screen is digitally superimposed on the image and the presence does not seem to originate or emerge from any recognizable device, like a smartphone, but rather is placed incongruously over the central section of the image. The holographic projection disrupts the visual flow of the image, as there is no visible source emitting it, such as a phone or holographic device. This disrupts the natural visual continuity because the screen lacks a physical origin within the picture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any noticeable artifacts or unnatural colors where the holographic screen connects with the phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic screen in Image B is digitally added and exhibits neon blue colors that contrast sharply with the natural colors of the surrounding objects, such as the sandwich and knife. Artifacts are visible in terms of digital glow and transparency effects that do not blend seamlessly with the other natural textures and colors in the image, indicating a foreign element that visually disrupts the scene. Given there is no phone visible to connect with the holographic screen, its appearance is unnatural.",

      "question": "Do the dimensions of the holographic projection screen match the scale of the surrounding objects in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic projection screen in Image B appears large and covers a significant portion of the sandwich, which suggests a scale mismatch with the surrounding objects. Typically, a projected screen might be smaller to fit within the proportions of a handheld device, yet here it is disproportionately large, as viewed against the scale of the sandwich and knife nearby. This discrepancy indicates that the apparent dimensions are not consistently scaled with the other items in the image.",

      "question": "Has the overall texture and detail of the sandwich been preserved despite the addition of the holographic screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic screen in Image B partially covers the sandwich, introducing additional visual elements that overlay onto the texture of the bread and filling. While the sandwich itself retains its texture where visible, the holographic addition obscures part of the detail, especially in regions where its neon blue pattern and transparency overlap with the natural sandwich texture. The visibility of the sandwich detail is therefore compromised in the masked area.",

      "question": "Does the background remain consistent and undistorted by the addition of the holographic projection screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, aside from the holographic screen's positioning, the visible aspects of the background, such as the table surface and paper, do not appear to be altered or distorted. The rest of the image, excluding areas directly affected by the holographic screen, maintains its original consistency. This indicates that the background predominantly remains unaffected despite the addition.",
