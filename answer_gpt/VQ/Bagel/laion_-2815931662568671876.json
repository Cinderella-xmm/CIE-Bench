      "question": "Does the monocle added to the tortilla chip maintain a consistent size and shape relative to the chip, and is it seamlessly integrated without visible artifacts or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monocle on the tortilla chip is sized and shaped appropriately relative to the chip, appearing round and fitting well over one of the 'eyes' drawn on the chip. The integration seems smooth without noticeable artifacts or unnatural shading, indicating a careful addition to maintain consistency in size and shape relative to the character's facial features.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hand-like appendage attached to the guacamole mound proportionally sized and shaped like a realistic hand, with no more than five fingers and natural joint lines, and does it appear to emerge naturally from the guacamole without breaking its texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand-like appendage in Image B appears cartoonish, lacking realism in its appearance and structure. It looks more like a simple line drawing rather than a realistic hand with natural joint lines or detailed fingers. It emerges from the guacamole mound, maintaining the cartoonish style but not preserving the texture needed for a realistic depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the spice rack positioned behind the tortilla chip in a way that respects perspective and shadow direction, and does it blend naturally with the existing background without visible seams or color mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spice rack in Image B is positioned behind the tortilla chip. It follows the comic style perspective, respecting the orientation and background blending typical in cartoon depictions. There are no apparent color mismatches or visible seams, providing a cohesive integration within the cartoon context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mini flag banners aligned horizontally and evenly spaced above the table, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with the light source, without appearing flat or digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mini flag banners are aligned above the table in a horizontal manner characteristic of celebratory settings. The flags cast slight shadows, hinting at a consistent light source. They fit seamlessly into the comic art style without flatness or stylistic inconsistency, giving the appearance of a three-dimensional space despite the simplified drawing style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the colors of the tortilla chip and guacamole been adjusted to pastel shades without losing their inherent textures or becoming unnaturally pale or washed out, maintaining visual credibility as edible items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are adapted into pastel-like shades typical of a comic style. While they retain simplified textures consistent with the simplified, cartoonish representation, they do not lose inherent characteristics completely nor appear washed out. However, due to the style, they differ from realistic depictions but retain an edible portrayal in the context of a comic.",
