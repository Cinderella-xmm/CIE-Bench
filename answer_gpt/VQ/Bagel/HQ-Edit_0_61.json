      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the table appear transformed into a tea box lid with consistent geometry and engraved leaf patterns that follow natural contours without warping or breaking the surface structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tea box lid is the central focus. It features a patterned design with an engraved teapot and leaf motif, consistent with the geometry and contours of the box. Since Image B is completely separate from the visual of Image A, without a reference table, the analysis solely considers the box’s design. The lid's structure remains flat, and the engraved elements such as teapots and leaves do not break the surface or warp, staying consistent geometrically and aesthetically with tea packaging. Therefore, integrating with the natural design without distortions or breakages is the desired result.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the replaced cups depicted with clear, detailed sustainable material textures (such as fibrous or layered patterns) that appear natural and integrated into the scene without visible artifacts or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the absence of cups altogether means that the question transcends the direct analysis of literal visuals. Hence, no depiction of cups requires considering sustainable textures or the absence of distortion or blurring common in material depiction. As such, direct assessment of integration or material detail is not applicable in this context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tag with the text \"Zen Autumn Tea\" clearly legible, stylistically consistent with the scene’s aesthetic, and seamlessly integrated with proper lighting and shadow alignment to avoid appearing pasted on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Zen Autumn Tea' is clearly visible on the middle of the box lid, indicating its identity and brand. The box features a consistent aesthetic aligned with tea packaging, and the tag's stylistic art aligns with traditional design. No visual artifacts suggest improper lighting or shadow casting, supporting seamless integration without appearing pasted, maintaining harmony with the rest of the box surface.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the teapot reshaped into a leaf contour with smooth, continuous edges and natural-looking earthy textures that do not show distortion, clipping, or unnatural color gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a teapot illustration on the box rather than an actual teapot from Image A. The teapot is shown in a simplified form without a leaf contour, focusing more on representing it as an icon in the context of tea packaging. An earthy gradient is present but not reflecting an actual physical teapot transformation. Smooth continuity in outline without clipping or unnatural gradients apply in the context of graphic design rather than a true transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all edited elements (tea box lid, sustainable cups, brand tag, leaf-shaped teapot) align with the original lighting direction and cast consistent shadows, maintaining spatial harmony and depth without floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a complete shift from any depiction of the table and teapot setup from Image A. Image B features a single box with no direct lighting or shadow related to the prior setup. Analysis focuses on packaging design over spatial harmony, depth, or lighting comparison to a table scene. Elements within the flat graphic design remain aligned internally without spatial distortions; however, without a coherent edge of visible cups or leaf-shaped teapots corroborate alignment in the same physical space.",
