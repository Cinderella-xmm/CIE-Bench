    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the surface of the mannequin's body exhibit a consistent weathered stone texture throughout, without patches of remaining metallic sheen or abrupt material changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mannequin is depicted as a stone sculpture. The surface texture consistently shows weathered stone features typical of sculptures, such as dullness and graininess, without metallic sheen or sudden changes in material. This indicates careful editing to ensure homogeneity in texture.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mannequinâ€™s pose proportionally correct and structurally stable, with limbs positioned in a way that aligns with classical Indian sculpture conventions (e.g., slight tilt of head, bent elbow, relaxed hand placement) without unnatural bending or floating limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pose in Image B replicates classical Indian sculpture aesthetics. The limbs are realistically placed, with a bent elbow and the hand close to the body, reflecting traditional art norms without unrealistic or awkward positioning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the necklace and bangle rendered as three-dimensional stone carvings with defined edges and depth, matching their original positions and proportions, and free from ghosting or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jewelry is sculpted as part of the stone mannequin. The edges are well-defined with depth and appear seamlessly integrated into the sculpture, accurately reflecting their positioning in the original image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the folds of the saree and contours of the body show subtle signs of weathering such as surface pitting, uneven texture, and shadowed crevices, without distorting the overall shape or creating artificial highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The saree's folds and the mannequin's contours display typical weathered features, like pitted textures and shadowed areas that are common in aged stone. These signs complement the stone transformation without introducing distortion or unsightly highlights.",
