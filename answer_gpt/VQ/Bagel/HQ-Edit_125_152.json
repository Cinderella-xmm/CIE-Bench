      "question": "Are the sheet music patterns integrated into the wingâ€™s orange sections without breaking the natural vein lines or causing visible texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual inspection of Image B, the sheet music patterns appear on separate sheets in the background, not incorporated directly into the butterfly's wings. The wings maintain their natural vein lines without any artifacts from sheet music integration. The distinct presence of sheet music in the background implies that the patterns were not added to the wings themselves.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the antennae extend from the head in a smooth, continuous curve without unnatural kinks, breaks, or disproportionate length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's antennae are depicted with smooth, continuous curves originating from the head with no visible kinks or breaks. The length of the antennae appears proportionate to the size of the butterfly, maintaining a natural look.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the petal shapes of the newly added flowers formed like musical notes but still maintain natural curvature and thickness consistent with real petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents flowers with petals shaped in the usual floral format, not resembling musical notes. The petals maintain a natural curvature and thickness consistent with real flowers, as observed by their consistent appearance and shape throughout the image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the butterfly and surrounding flowers arranged in a balanced circular pattern where each element appears at a plausible distance and angle relative to the others?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements including the butterfly and flowers are arranged circularly, surrounding the text in the middle. The distance and angles between these elements seem balanced and evenly distributed, creating a harmonious appearance.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title text in Image B is rendered with smooth and continuous strokes. There are no signs of aliasing or jagged edges, giving the text a polished and clear appearance that enhances readability.",
