    "Question": "Q1: Do the cloud textures on the seat, backrest, and armrests appear soft, layered, and continuous without flat or blocky regions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the textures simulate the soft, fluffy appearance of clouds. The layers are visibly rounded and smoothly transition into one another, imitating natural cloud formations without flat or blocky interruptions. This appearance is likely achieved through careful manipulation of shading and contour to mimic softness.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the wooden frame and legs replaced with branching, flowing wind-like structures that follow natural fluid motion without sharp angles or rigid breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden frame and legs are replaced with structures resembling branches that have continuous curvature and resemble natural organic growth. These details imitate the flowing motion of wind or organic tree branches, rather than displaying sharp angles or rigid, unnatural breaks. This artistic choice provides an illusion of continuity and grace in the structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the eyes positioned on the upper cushions with smooth integration into the cloud texture, lacking jagged edges or unnatural color contrasts?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes eyes positioned on the forefront, smoothly integrated into the cloud textures. The placement and design maintain thematic continuity with rounded and consistent coloring that complements the cloud-like formation. This avoids any visual disruptions in the overall softness and cohesion of the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the mist trail extend continuously from the back of the sofa with consistent texture and fading intensity, without sudden breaks or unnatural boundaries?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mist trail emerging from the cloud formation exhibits a gentle gradient, maintaining texture continuity and consistent fading. There are no visible abrupt breaks or unnatural boundary definitions within this misty effect, providing a smooth transition into the surrounding space.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the overall structure of the sofa preserved with proper alignment between the seat, backrest, arms, and base, without visible gaps, overlaps, or geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while artistic modifications transform the original structure into a cloud-like formation, the essential alignment between components like the seat, backrest, and arms is still indicative of the sofa. The fluid transitions and maintained proportions resemble natural relationships between sofa parts without observable gaps or distortions often associated with structural chaos.",
    "answer": "Yes"
