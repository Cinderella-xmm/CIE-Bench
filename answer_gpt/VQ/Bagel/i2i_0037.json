      "question": "Does the white border framing the image maintain a clean edge along the entire perimeter without disrupting the natural appearance of the dessert inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) has a white border added to give it a Polaroid-style appearance. This border is consistent, forming a clean frame around the photo. It does not intersect with or disrupt the image of the dessert inside, maintaining the visual integrity of the focal subject (the cheesecake and bananas). Common understanding of framing suggests that a properly applied border should serve to enhance, not diminish, the main content.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the light brown vintage filter applied to the image enhance its film-style appearance without causing any parts of the banana slices or whipped cream to appear unnaturally colored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, a sepia or light brown vintage filter gives the photo an aged, film-style effect. This filter alters the color tones but should not distort the inherent colors of key elements, such as the bananas and whipped cream, to the extent that they become unrecognizable. The bananas and whipped cream, while now carrying a vintage hue, retain their expected appearance under such a filter, suggesting no extreme discoloration occurs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the handwritten caption \"Banana Cream Dream 2024\" at the bottom clear and legible with a natural look that complements the Polaroid-style photo without seeming out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The caption 'Banana Cream Dream 2024' appears at the bottom of the frame in a handwriting style that matches the informal, personal touch typically associated with Polaroid captions. It is legible, coherent, and complements the Polaroid style without appearing artificial or dissonant with the overall aesthetic, which is consistent with how such captions are intended to look as a personalized label.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details like the texture of the whipped cream and the smooth surface of the cheesecake slice been preserved without showing any unnatural artifacts or blurring due to the editing effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In evaluating the edited image, the texture of the whipped cream and the smoothness of the cheesecake have been slightly modified due to the overall vintage filter. While these textures might not be as sharp as in an unfiltered image, they do not exhibit unnatural artifacts or severe blurring. The image maintains sufficient detail to identify these elements, indicating that the editing does not compromise their appearance overly.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the newly added Polaroid frame and caption seamlessly integrate with the original image of the cheesecake and bananas, ensuring the dessert remains the focal point and no elements look disjointed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Polaroid frame and caption in the edited image are well-aligned with the rest of the image's elements. They look to be intentionally added to enhance the retro and nostalgic feel without interfering with the subject of the dessert. The focal point remains on the cheesecake and bananas, suggesting a successful integration where no new elements appear out of place or distract from the visual emphasis on the dessert.",
