      "question": "Do the luminous panels follow the exact shape and curvature of the original headâ€™s surface without visible gaps or overlapping seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminous panels are applied to a structure that resembles a head. By closely examining the lines where these panels are placed, they appear to follow the overall contour and shape of the head without noticeable gaps or overlapping seams. Luminous panels typically need to be precisely fabricated to fit such complex structures to avoid visible imperfections. Thus, it is important for visual continuity that these panels follow existing contours accurately. On observation, the panels seem to have been aligned well with the shape of the object.",

      "question": "Are the neon animations on the digital panels displayed with sharp, continuous light patterns and no pixelated or fragmented sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By observing the panels in Image B, the neon animations look smooth and continuous. The technology used for such displays, especially in a futuristic or highly digital environment, would need to ensure that there are no pixelated sections or fragmentation to maintain high visual quality. Considering common neon signage and digital displays, the lighting seems clear and continuous without any disruption across the panels.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the synthetic foliage emit a soft, even glow from within, and do the individual plant forms have defined structure and depth without appearing like flat decals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the synthetic foliage positioned around the pedestal emits a gentle glow, suggesting a source of internal lighting. The individual plant shapes are distinguishable, appearing to have a 3D form with proper structure and depth. This arrangement ensures they do not look like mere 2D images pasted onto the surface. Such characteristics are typical for synthetic or artificial plant designs intended to complement modern installations.",

      "question": "Do the metallic surfaces of the surrounding buildings show accurate reflections and subtle surface variations without distorted grid patterns or stretched textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buildings visible in Image B have metallic surfaces that appear consistent with real metallic finishes. Accurate reflection would display subtle variations and gradients typical of metal surfaces. Upon close observation, there seems to be no obvious distortion in reflections or any stretched textures; the surfaces maintain a realistic representation of metal. This indicates a high level of detail and texture mapping accuracy in the image.",

      "question": "Is the transformed head and pedestal aligned correctly with the horizon and surrounding buildings, showing no angular distortion or perspective mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head and pedestal appear consistently aligned with the surrounding architecture. The perspective shown does not reveal any angular distortion or mismatches in alignment with the horizon line or nearby building structures. Such alignment is crucial for maintaining the realism of a scene. Based on observation, the positioning looks harmonized with the environment, indicating correct alignment.",
