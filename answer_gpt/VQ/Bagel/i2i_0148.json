      "question": "Are the reflections on the carsâ€™ surfaces clear and consistent with their surroundings without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflections on the car surfaces appear more vibrant due to the increased contrast and coloration effects, which may not align with real-world lighting conditions. The reflections show red hues that mimic traffic light reflections but seem magnified or exaggerated compared to typical conditions. This is a result of the high-contrast, high-saturation edits applied to the image, altering the natural appearance of reflections. Thus, these reflections could be considered inconsistent with the natural environment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the enhanced environmental haze create a realistic atmospheric depth without blurring or distorting the structural elements of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases an enhanced haze effect, which is meant to impart atmospheric depth. However, the haze has altered the clarity of the background, particularly the trees and other elements, introducing a slightly blurred look. This impacts the realism of atmospheric depth, as fine details are less discernible, and structural elements might seem somewhat distorted due to the overwhelming presence of the haze.",

      "question": "Has the increased contrast enhanced the visual impact without producing unnatural colors or excessive glare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The increased contrast in Image B heavily emphasizes colors, especially red, creating a very high-impact visual picture. While this enhances the visual pop of the image, it also pushes some colors, like the sky and reflections, into unnatural territories with excessive saturation. Therefore, while visually striking, the coloration gathered from the contrast edit may not seem natural or true to the original tone of the scene.",

      "question": "Does the movie poster style conversion maintain visual credibility with the traffic lights and road markings appearing undistorted and logically intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the artistic enhancements, the traffic lights and road markings are clear and maintain their structural integrity. The colors on the traffic lights are bright, drawing attention, but they do not appear distorted. Similarly, road markings remain visible and undistorted, preserving logical consistency within the edited visual style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the cars, such as paint texture and taillight designs, been preserved without introducing unnatural artifacts or degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The details of the cars in Image B remain mostly intact with regards to shape and structure. However, the exaggeration of contrast and color casts some shadows and reflections that appear unnatural due to digital enhancement. Despite this, the essential details like the taillights and design are preserved, but the color alterations give a somewhat artifact-ridden impression. While not fragmented, the tones skew away from a realistic depiction.",
