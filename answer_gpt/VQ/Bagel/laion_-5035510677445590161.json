      "question": "Does the explorer coat have a consistent fabric texture with visible stitching and leather accents that appear physically plausible and free of obvious digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The explorer coat in Image B is analyzed based on its texture and details. The coat displays a consistent fabric texture with visible stitching and leather accents, suggesting a high level of detail often seen in realistic digital renderings. The stitching and leather appear to be modeled to resemble 18th-century clothing styles, which adds to their plausibility, as the overall design elements are kept coherent without obvious digital artifacts breaking the illusion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the tricorn hat properly shaped with three distinct points, correctly sized for the head, and casting a natural shadow consistent with the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the tricorn hat in Image B, the hat is shaped in a manner consistent with traditional tricorn hats, having three distinct points. The size appears appropriate for the character's head, and the shadows cast by the hat are consistent with an overhead and slightly angled light source, complementing the rest of the image's lighting setup.",

      "question": "Does the leather gauntlet on the extended hand show five fingers with natural joint bends, and does it connect seamlessly to the sleeve without visible seams or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leather gauntlet in Image B clearly shows five fingers with joint bends that are natural in appearance. The fingers do not display awkward angles or digital distortion, and the gauntlet transitions smoothly into the sleeve, with no visible seams or disruptions at the junction. This detailed connectivity enhances the physical plausibility of the garment being illustrated.",

      "question": "Is the snowy mountain background seamlessly blended with the figure, showing consistent lighting, depth cues, and no visible cutout lines or color mismatches along the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowy mountain background in Image B is assessed for its integration with the main figure. The lighting on both the figure and the background appears consistent, and the depth cues are appropriately maintained. There are no visible cutout lines or color mismatches at the edges where the figure meets the background, indicating a seamless blend between the elements of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features, including the beard, glasses, and skin tone, preserved without distortion, and do they receive lighting consistent with the direction and quality of light in the snowy mountain scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the facial features are blurred and not the focus of the analysis, the surrounding details such as the beard, glasses, and skin tone would need to align with the snowy scene's lighting if visible. Typically, such renderings maintain consistency in lighting direction and quality, aligning these elements with the overall scene composition. However, specific evaluation here is limited due to blurring.",
