      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the black ink outlines around the car's body, wheels, and wing consistently sharp and aligned with the underlying shapes without breaking or overlapping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car features a cartoon-style rendering with prominent black outlines. These outlines act as defining features, giving the car its structure within the simplified drawing style. The outlines are clean and precise, following the contours of the car's body, wheels, and wing without noticeable breaks or overlap, which is typical in comic styling. Based on this observation and the typical characteristics of comic-style illustrations, the outlines maintain integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the halftone dots on the car’s side panels and wing appear evenly spaced and consistent in density without visible banding or irregular clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the halftone dots are intended to add texture and depth typical of comic-style artwork. Observing the side panels and wing area, there is no visible evidence of uneven dot distribution or clustering, suggesting consistent application. Although differences may exist compared to a realistic rendering, within the context of a comic-style, the halftone appears uniform.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors on the car (such as the wing and side panels) now rendered in muted orange, cream, and deep gray without any residual bright or unnatural hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the color scheme adheres to a limited palette typical of comic illustrations, using muted colors that include shades of orange, cream, and gray. These colors do not display any residual bright or unnatural hues, indicating the transition from a realistic color scheme to a more stylized, subdued one consistent with comic art.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the motion lines behind the car straight, evenly spaced, and aligned with the direction of travel without curving or intersecting improperly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, motion lines are a common element to suggest speed and movement in comics. The lines behind the car are straight and parallel, aligning well with the car's direction of travel, which enhances the illusion of speed typical in comic-style renditions. There are no curves or improper intersections observed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the speech bubble containing “VROOM!” located above the car, fully visible, and free from overlap with the car’s wing or other structural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is text present, it is not located above the car in a traditional speech bubble format. Instead, the text appears integrated within the wind wing and the comic action noise 'FROM!' drawn near the rear wheel. The classic speech bubble featuring 'VROOM!' as specified does not exist per traditional placement above the car.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the background behind the car been simplified into flat or textured blocks without retaining detailed figures or structures that conflict with the comic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typical detailed background from Image A has been transformed into stylized clouds and simple lines, fitting the comic style's flat or textured appearance. Detailed figures or structures are not present as they have been abstracted, maintaining the simplification aligned with comic aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the car’s wheels properly aligned with the axles, and do the suspension arms maintain correct angles and connections without bending or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car's design imitates the original proportions and engineering layout. The wheels appear aligned with the axles, and the suspension arms are depicted without unnecessary bending or distortion. This corresponds with the expected simplification in a comic rendering, maintaining proportional integrity.",

      "question": "Are the sponsor logos on the car’s wing and body still recognizable and legible despite the comic-style treatment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the comic-style treatment abstractly mimics the logo placement and contrast, the logos have lost their recognizable clarity due to stylization. The identifiable sharpness and legibility evident in the original are not present in the comic depiction, thus not allowing for recognition.",
