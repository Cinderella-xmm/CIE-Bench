      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the entire body of the dog exhibit a uniform, polished wood texture with visible grain patterns that follow the contours of the figure, without abrupt transitions or unnatural patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's body appears to be made of wood with a polished texture. The wood grain patterns are visible and follow the natural shape and contours of the figure. There are no abrupt transitions or unnatural patches that break this continuity, which suggests the wooden texture is uniformly applied throughout the body.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the black-and-white facial pattern accurately represented by distinct dark and light wood tones along the central vertical line of the face, with no smudging or misalignment?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dog's face with a clear distinction between dark and light wood tones along the central vertical line, mimicking the black-and-white pattern seen in the original plush-like depiction (Image A). The transition between these tones is well-defined without any smudging or misalignment, displaying a careful and precise representation of the pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features—such as the eye sockets, nose bridge, and mouth outline—accentuated with fine, realistic carved lines that enhance depth without distorting proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's facial features, including the eye sockets, nose bridge, and mouth, are highlighted with neatly carved lines that give a sense of depth and dimension.

      "question": "Do all body parts—head, ears, legs, and paws—maintain smooth, rounded contours consistent with the original form, without flattened areas or sharp edges that suggest poor carving?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog in Image B is crafted with smooth, rounded contours throughout its body parts, including the head, ears, legs, and paws. These features retain the soft, rounded aesthetic similar to the original form depicted in Image A, and there are no flat areas or sharp edges that might indicate substandard carving practices.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden dog figure is stationed on a flat wooden platform.
