    "Question": "Q1: Does the surface of the ballerina’s body show consistent marble texture with subtle chisel marks across all areas including arms, torso, legs, and face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the statue seems to have been crafted to resemble a traditional marble statue, which typically would have a uniform material and a smooth, polished finish with subtle chisel marks. Marble sculptures usually exhibit consistent texture across all parts of the body due to the nature of marble and the carving techniques used. Observing the chiseled patterns and texture in Image B, especially on the statue's arms, torso, and legs, we can establish if there is consistency. Given the visual cues that indicate a homogeneous marble texture, it is likely to be consistent across the statue.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the folds and flow of the robe draped over the ballerina's body physically plausible and consistent with how heavy fabric would hang on a sculpted form?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the robe is designed to emulate the way a heavy fabric would naturally flow and form folds. This can be identified through the draping technique implying a sense of gravity, weigh, and natural flow that replicates a realistically heavy robe. Sculptors often master the depiction of cloth to hang in a manner that suggests weight and dimension appropriate for stone. Given the visual realism in fabric flow and folding, the robe looks physically plausible for a sculpture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the laurel wreath positioned correctly on the head without distorting the skull shape or causing misalignment with facial features?",
    "explanation": "In the context of Image B, a properly positioned laurel wreath should rest naturally around the head without altering its shape or disturbing the alignment of the facial features. Observing the placement, it needs to appear proportionally balanced and leave the head shape undistorted. This serves to maintain the aesthetic standard expected in classical sculptures, where wreaths do not misfit the form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the feet retain proper human anatomy and alignment while appearing as carved stone, with no deformation or disproportionate elongation?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, the feet should exhibit stone-carved qualities consistent with a classical style. Properly carved, they would retain the anatomical structure of a human foot, keeping proportions aligned correctly relative to the rest of the body. Classical sculptures often emphasize realistic anatomy, even in stone, avoiding disproportionate traits. The feet in Image B appear to maintain these attributes without evident deformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the Ionic columns and mosaic floor aligned with the figure’s scale and perspective, showing no mismatch in depth or proportion?",
    "explanation": "Image B should reflect accurate scale alignment and proportion consistency between the architectural elements (Ionic columns, mosaic floor) and the statue. A classic sculpture setting typically matches the depth and scale of the surroundings harmoniously, respecting architectural perspective principles that align with the statue's size. Observing the placement and proportion of the columns and the mosaic floor, there appears to be correct alignment and proportional consistency, suggesting no mismatch.",
    "answer": "Yes"
