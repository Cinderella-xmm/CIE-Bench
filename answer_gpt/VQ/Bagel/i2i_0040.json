      "question": "Are the textures on the bike frame and surrounding grass natural, without any visible artifacts or unnatural color variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bike's frame exhibits smooth and consistent colors without pixelation or artifacts, suggesting edited but achieved natural-looking textures. The grass appears in a singular color with no noticeable variations or artifacts beyond the board. However, the lack of detailed texture might indicate less natural editing on the grass. This suggests that the frame is well-textured, but the grass might show digital editing simplicity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wheels and frame of the bike maintain their correct proportions and geometry, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bike within a virtual interface that does not appear distorted—it reflects standard proportions seen in bicycles. The alignment, circular wheel shape, and general dimensions are consistent with what is traditionally expected for a bike. Despite being within an interface design, the bike is visually coherent, suggesting no deformation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background clean and free from distracting elements, preserving the natural scene and focusing on the bike without introducing unnecessary elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bike is presented in a digital interface setup which inherently cleans up the background, effectively eliminating outdoor distracting elements. The focus remains entirely on the digital representation of the bike, demonstrating no interference with natural outdoor elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the bike and the surrounding area look natural and consistent with the original environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is reflective of a digital interface rather than the outdoor environmental lighting seen in Image A. It lacks shadows associated with natural light sources and doesn't display any form of depth that natural lighting would on such objects. Thus, it's inconsistent with a natural environment's lighting effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bike positioned naturally within the frame, maintaining visual coherence and plausibility without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bike is within a screen interface designed for showcasing products or features rather than natural positioning in outdoor spaces. While the bike is well-positioned within this interface, the digitized environmental placement can make it appear less natural compared to outdoor settings where one would expect to see bicycles.",
