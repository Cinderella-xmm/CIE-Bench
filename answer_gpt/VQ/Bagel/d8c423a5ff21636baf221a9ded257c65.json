    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head-to-body ratio of the figure exaggerated but still structurally coherent, with no visible warping or misalignment of facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi style often features exaggerated proportions such as a large head relative to the body, which is typical and intentional. This image shows such characteristics with a larger head, but it is balanced with the body size, maintaining a coherent structure without any visible warping or misalignment of facial features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dress exhibit a smooth, consistent porcelain-like surface with no rough patches, texture artifacts, or unnatural glare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress appears to have a smooth, polished surface, akin to a porcelain figure. There are no visible rough patches, texture artifacts, or unnatural glare. The image's style suggests a uniform and consistent appearance, typical of high-quality chibi figures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lamb positioned in the lap with sufficient volume and soft texture, and does it rest naturally within the hands without clipping or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamb is placed on the lap of the figure and seems to have a sufficient three-dimensional volume, indicating a soft texture. The hands of the figure appear to be naturally placed around it without any obvious clipping or floating effects, suggesting proper alignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the base beneath the figure aligned with the foreground plane and does it blend seamlessly with the background without casting incorrect shadows or creating floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base is aligned with the foreground plane. It sits level and blends with the background without creating any floating effects. The overall integration seems visually coherent without inconsistent shadows.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the eyes proportionally enlarged but symmetrically placed, with no distortion in shape or spacing relative to the nose and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are enlarged, which is characteristic of the chibi style, yet remain symmetrical and properly placed on the face. They maintain uniform shape and correct spacing relative to the nose and mouth, ensuring the facial features look balanced.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural joint alignment and no extra or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is designed in a simplified chibi style, and the hands often lack detailed anatomy such as individually articulated fingers. There is no apparent design indicating a full set of five fingers aligned naturally due to its markedly stylized form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the necklace and pendant clearly visible with consistent metallic texture and no pixelation or blurring around edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no necklace or pendant is visible on the figure, which suggests that the design does not include these elements, unlike the original classic portrait style in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the background retain the original sky gradient, horizon line, and mountain silhouette without visible seams or color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been eliminated entirely in favor of a simpler setting typical for showcasing figures, thus lacking the original sky gradient, horizon line, and mountain silhouette. Consequently, there is no opportunity for seams or color shifts related to these elements.",
