      "question": "Are the cutout windows on each tier aligned with the chocolate drops and have smooth, uninterrupted edges without jagged or fragmented borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cutout windows on the chocolate tree structure appear to be aligned symmetrically along the vertical axis of the tree, fitting the chocolate drops and embellishments within each tier perfectly. The edges of the cutout windows are smooth, which ensures that there are no jagged or fragmented borders visible. This alignment and edge quality suggest good craftsmanship and design execution.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gold foiling applied across the surface show uniform reflectivity and smooth transitions without visible seams, pixelation, or overly bright spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold embellishments are found in nut clusters and other decorative elements. The reflectivity of these gold elements is consistent and smooth, lacking any visible seams or pixelation. There are no overly bright spots, which indicates a careful application of the gold texture. These observations imply a high-quality presentation of the gold foiling.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the nut embellishments attached to the chocolate surface with natural positioning, showing correct shadows and depth, and no floating or misplaced instances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nut embellishments on the chocolate tree are arranged in a natural and intentional manner. They exhibit proper shadows, aligning with the lighting direction, and show depth consistent with their position on the tree. There are no signs of nuts floating above the surface or placed incorrectly, suggesting a realistic and precise visual integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sparkle effects evenly distributed and faint enough to resemble light reflections on chocolate, without forming clusters or sharp, unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no overly excessive sparkle effects on the chocolate surface. Any highlights present are subtle and mimic natural light reflections, without forming unrealistic clusters or sharp spots. This balanced approach maintains the image's realism and suggests an intentional design aiming for authenticity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the new text “ChocoConifer Delights” clearly readable, properly spaced, and integrated into the base without overlapping or distorting the surrounding chocolate ring or motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text “ChocoConifer Delights” is prominently displayed at the base of the chocolate structure. The typography is clear and legible, with proper spacing that does not interfere with any surrounding decorative motifs. There are no signs of distortion or overlap with the chocolate elements, indicating a thoughtful and precise integration.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the tiers of the tower evenly spaced and aligned vertically, preserving the original conical shape without bulging, shrinking, or skewed angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chocolate tree structure is shown with tiers that are distinctly and consistently spaced. The alignment is vertical with no distortion of the conical shape. Each level demonstrates balance in spacing and alignment, indicating an adherence to design symmetry, thus avoiding any bulging, shrinking, or skewed angles.",
