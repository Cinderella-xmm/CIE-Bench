      "question": "Do the golden horn-like spikes on the headstock align symmetrically with the neck and show no signs of clipping, distortion, or mismatched angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a dragon with prominent horn-like spikes on its head, which is a different context from a guitar's headstock. These spikes seem to be symmetrically aligned with the body in a manner typical for a dragon depiction, showing no signs of clipping, distortion, or mismatched angles thanks to their clear continuity with the dragon's body. In comparison, a guitar headstock typically does not have such spikes, hence there is no mismatch in interpretation from Image A.",

      "question": "Are the luminescent runes clearly visible along the fretboard without bleeding into the wood or appearing as separate floating overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon in Image B has a bright, luminescent line along its chest and neck which resembles runes. These runes are integrated into the dragon's skin and appear as part of its body without bleeding into other parts. They are not floating or separate, appearing continuous and embedded. Comparing to Image A, where a guitar has frets but no runes or glowing elements, therefore, this question is not directly applicable to Image B.",

      "question": "Do the fiery tendrils originate from the bridge and terminate at the nut, following a continuous and uninterrupted path without gaps or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fiery appearance runs along the dragon's spine and wings rather than from a guitar bridge to nut, but it does provide a continuity typical of the body of a dragon with no apparent gaps or floating segments. This fiery path follows a logical flow from the base of the neck to the head. Compared to Image A of the guitar, there is no analog to fiery tendrils; thus, the context shifts dramatically in interpretation.",

      "question": "Are the wing structures symmetrical on both sides of the body and covered in evenly spaced, realistic scale patterns without gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a dragon with wings, and these wings are symmetrical and have a well-defined pattern of scales and membranes that appear evenly spaced without obvious gaps or distortions. The level of detail and realism in Image B with regards to the symmetry and texture is consistent with typical fantasy dragon art. For Image A, as it is a guitar, there are no wings to compare this aspect to.",

      "question": "Does the body maintain the original guitar's silhouette while showing consistent dragon-like textures such as scales or ridges, with no visible seams or loss of contour detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, featuring a dragon, naturally doesn't maintain a guitar's silhouette, but it does maintain a consistent dragon-like texture and detailed contour typical of a dragon with scales and ridges. The dragon's form displays consistent detail throughout, without seams. In contrast, Image A is a guitar with a standard silhouette and smooth surface. The interpretation regarding textual consistency in another form remains indirectly comparative.",
