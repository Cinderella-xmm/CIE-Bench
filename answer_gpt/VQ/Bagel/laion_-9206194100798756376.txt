    "Question": "Q1: Is the crown positioned on the chicken's head in a way that maintains proportional size and natural integration with the skin texture, without visible seams or unnatural lighting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crown is placed on the chicken's head. The size of the crown appears proportional to the chicken's head, and it seems naturally integrated without conspicuous seams. The lighting on the crown is consistent with the rest of the scene, suggesting a natural placement in the image. This implies the artist took care to align the crown's size, texture, and lighting for natural integration.",
