      "question": "Do the brass pistons and gears replacing the cheetahs' leg joints appear structurally coherent and free from unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe that brass pistons and gears are integrated into the leg joints of the cheetahs. These mechanical elements are designed in a steampunk style, and from a visual standpoint, they are well-aligned with the cheetahs' leg parts, maintaining a consistent stylistic approach. There are no visible distortions or misalignments, and the textures match the expected appearance of well-crafted metal components. The balance and proportions seem coherent considering the intended mechanical aesthetic.",

      "question": "Does the transition from spotted fur to tooled leather and copper plating look natural and free from obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a transition where the cheetahs' fur gradually merges into tooled leather and copper plating. The transition appears seamless as the fur's texture flows into the metallic and leathery textures without jarring edges or abrupt changes. This conversion is consistent with an aesthetically coherent steampunk design, suggesting an intentional transformation rather than a poorly executed edit.",

      "question": "Are the glowing amber lenses in place of the cheetahs' eyes integrated naturally without disrupting the visual credibility of their faces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cheetahs with glowing amber lenses replacing their eyes, which contributes to a cybernetic or robotic appearance. The lenses are positioned accurately, maintaining the anatomical placement of the eyes. The surrounding facial fur and structure do not show any unnatural blending or distortion, suggesting that the edited lenses are integrated naturally with the rest of the facial features.",

      "question": "Do the fantastical clockwork structures and coppery clouds in the background integrate seamlessly with the savanna horizon without causing visual distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B includes fantastical steampunk elements such as clockwork structures and copper-hued clouds. These are aligned with the horizon and visually blend with the savanna landscape. The perspective and lighting are consistent with the scene, and there are no obvious visual discontinuities between the surreal elements and the more natural savanna. The copper clouds reflect a believable atmospheric condition consistent with the surrounding imagery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the cheetahs and the environment been preserved without loss or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details of both the cheetahs and their environment have been preserved during transformation. The textures on the cheetahs, whether fur or mechanical components, are crisply rendered without introducing pixelation or noise. The environment, including the ground and surrounding elements, maintains clarity and consistency in texture, showing skillful editing that preserves natural detail while incorporating surreal elements.",
