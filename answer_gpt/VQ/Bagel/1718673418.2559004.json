    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the mushroom-shaped rooftops proportionally scaled to the buildings and do they display smooth, continuous surfaces without visible seams or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mushroom-shaped rooftops are prominently featured with each building having a consistently shaped mushroom top. These are large, feature smooth curves, and blend seamlessly with the buildings below. There are no apparent seams or distorted geometry, maintaining visual consistency. By analyzing the natural characteristics of mushrooms and architectural designs, these elements appear proportionally scaled and well-integrated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lake surface show a uniform, flowing shimmer effect without pixelated or fragmented patterns, and does it reflect the sky and buildings in a way that appears fluid and continuous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks an actual lake surface, as the scene is set on floating islands. Therefore, there is no lake to evaluate. The area below the island features clouds and sky color, which continues smoothly without signs of pixelation or fragmentation; however, the question is not applicable due to the absence of a lake environment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the mountain structures resemble large, intertwined roots with natural branching patterns, and do they maintain smooth transitions from base to tip without abrupt geometric breaks or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'mountain structures' in Image B are not traditional mountains but more fantastical structures that hold the floating islands and are covered with large mushrooms. These structures do not resemble roots but have whimsical shapes supporting the floating land. Transition in imagery is smooth, but the interpretation asked doesn't strictly apply as these aren't traditional mountains.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the vines connecting the buildings uniformly textured, properly anchored at both ends, and free of floating segments or unnatural bends that violate plant growth logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, vines are depicted as connecting structures among the floating islands and mushrooms, with a consistent texture indicative of natural foliage. They appear properly anchored at both ends, integrated into the designs without any floating or unnaturally bent segments, which aligns with plant growth logic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bridges between buildings have smooth, glowing surfaces with no visible polygonal edges, and are they positioned so that they logically span between architectural supports without floating disconnectedly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible bridges connecting the buildings, as the architecture consists of floating villages primarily supported by the mushroom-shaped elements. Therefore, there are no surfaces to evaluate based on the criteria of glowing or polygonal edges, nor their positioning.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the leaf-shaped airships have organic, vein-like textures and hover above the water at a height consistent with their size, with underlying clouds rendered as soft, pastel-colored masses without sharp outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays floating boats or vessels shaped somewhat like leaves without prominent vein-like textures. These are suspended in a cloudy atmosphere rather than above water. The clouds have soft, pastel colors, smoothly integrated without sharp outlines, enhancing the idyllic scene. However, the description of the vessels directly above water doesn't apply.",
