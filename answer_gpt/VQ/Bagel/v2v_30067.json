      "question": "Do the restored areas of the clock tower seamlessly integrate with the original stone texture, avoiding any visible seams or unnatural patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower appears to have a very uniform and smooth stone texture across its structure. The visual information suggests uniformity in the stone texture, perhaps more so than what would be expected in an old clock tower, which often features more varied textures due to aging and weathering. This visual suggests a lack of visible seams or unnatural patches, as the stone texture does not show irregularities typically seen in reconstructions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the restored sections, such as the arches and clock face, consistent with the rest of the tower, avoiding any distortions or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clock tower where the arches and clock face appear proportionate and aligned with the overall structure. No obvious distortions or irregularities in shape are detected in the visual observations. The elements seem to blend seamlessly with the architectural style of the rest of the tower, suggesting that the restoration work is consistent with the existing structure.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the fine details, such as cracks and weathering patterns, been accurately replicated in the restored sections, preserving the historical look without losing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower shows a smooth and somewhat polished appearance with fewer visible cracks and weathering patterns compared to what might be expected from an aged clock tower. This visual uniformity suggests that while the restoration is coherent, the historical weathering details seem to be less pronounced or not accurately replicated, leading to a loss of fine historical details.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the restoration work enhance the tower's completeness, making it appear as though it was never damaged, while preserving its architectural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the clock tower as a complete and cohesive structure with no apparent damage. The seamless integration of restored sections makes the tower appear whole and intact, as if never damaged. The architectural features align well with what would be expected of a well-integrated restoration effort, thus maintaining the architectural integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the restored sections exhibit the same lighting and shadow effects as the original parts of the tower, contributing to a natural and cohesive appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire tower, including restored sections, consistently exhibits lighting and shadow effects. The shadows and highlights seem uniform across the structure, suggesting a consistent illumination source and maintaining a cohesive and natural look across both original and restored sections.",
