      "question": "Is the cylindrical glass dome fully enclosing the totem pole without visible clipping, jagged edges, or unnatural transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome is clearly enclosing the totem pole fully. The edges of the dome appear smooth without any visible clipping or jagged parts, and the transparency of the glass shows natural reflections and refractions, indicating high-quality rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ferns and moss at the base of the totem grounded and proportionally sized, with no floating or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ferns and moss are placed naturally around the base of the totem in Image B, giving the impression that they are growing from the ground. Their sizes are proportional in comparison to the totem, and they are properly aligned without any signs of floating or misalignment.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly perched on the top of the totem with correct scale, natural wing shape, and no deformation of the totem’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is depicted perched on the top of the dome, not on the totem itself. Thus, it does not affect or deform the totem’s structure. The butterfly's scale and wing shape appear natural, consistent with the perspective of the entire scene.",

      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Do the ferns, moss, and butterfly use natural green tones that harmonize with the wood color of the totem without unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ferns, moss, and butterfly in Image B use colors that seem natural for their respective objects and harmonize with the wood tones of the totem. There are no abrupt color shifts present, creating a cohesive and believable scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carved facial features and wood grain details on the totem remain clear and undistorted. This indicates that the editing has preserved the structural integrity and detail of the totem, enhancing its visibility rather than compromising it.",
