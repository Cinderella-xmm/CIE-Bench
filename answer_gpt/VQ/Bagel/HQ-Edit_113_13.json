    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the leaf crown on the fox’s head have natural leaf shapes, consistent texture, and proper alignment with the head without visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf crown on the fox’s head is artistically designed in a cartoonish way, reflecting simplified leaf shapes rather than realistic ones. The texture is smooth, typical of digital illustrations, and fits well with the fox's head, avoiding obvious seams or unnatural edges. The alignment appears intentional and stylistically appropriate for the cartoon genre, focusing on aesthetics rather than mimicking real-life leaf crowns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fox’s hind legs properly aligned and proportioned when standing upright, with no distorted joints, unnatural curvature, or missing limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a simplified, stylized cartoon fox, standing upright as is common in fictional representations. The hind legs are drawn in a way that corresponds to a playful interpretation, hence proportions may appear unrealistic compared to an actual fox but suitable within the artistic style. There's no visible distortion or unnatural curvature concerning the genre, and the illustration does not show any missing limbs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tree outlines in the background maintain clean, continuous lines without jagged edges, overlapping inconsistencies, or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree outlines in the cartoon forest background are simple and smooth, consistent with digital artwork standards. The lines are continuous and clean, avoiding jagged edges, overlapping inconsistencies, or missing segments, which maintains the cartoon's smooth and fluid design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pastel colors applied uniformly across the forest floor and foliage without creating unnatural color bleeding, pixelation, or loss of fine details like moss texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses pastel colors uniformly across the forest scene, consistent with animated or illustrated styles rather than realistic depictions. While fine details like moss texture are not emphasized, the colors are applied evenly, avoiding pixelation or unnatural color bleeding. This uniformity suits the simplified and stylized nature of the cartoon artwork.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the speech bubble positioned at a plausible distance from the fox, with correct shadowing and edge blending that matches the lighting and depth of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubble is placed appropriately above the fox's head, conforming to typical cartoon layout. Its positioning ensures it's readable and associated with the fox. The speech bubble's design in cartoons does not usually incorporate shadowing or edge blending realist attributes, rather achieving clarity in communication, fitting well within this context.",
