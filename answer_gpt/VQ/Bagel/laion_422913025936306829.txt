    "Question": "Q1: Are the color blocks applied across the shirtâ€™s surface uniform and sharply defined, with no visible smudging or blending between adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a clear distinction between different color blocks throughout the design. The vibrant neon shades are consistently applied with high contrast, where pink, blue, and yellow areas meet, they have clearly demarcated lines without blending, suggesting uniformity and sharpness.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the neon-colored patterns repeat consistently across the shirt, maintaining symmetry and alignment with the original layout?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the neon-colored patterns seem to diverge from the symmetry compared to the original. While the colors are vibrant and contrasting, the placement and outline of the patterns, such as yellow and blue filling areas, don't seem perfectly aligned with the geometric structures from the original image, indicating an adjustment rather than repetition.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the limbs and torso of the central figure proportionally accurate, with no exaggerated or broken joint lines that violate physical realism?",
    "explanation": "The central figure in Image B exhibits exaggerated musculature and unique color fill. While artistic styles can often exaggerate features for effect, the proportions appear intentionally stylized and don't follow realistic proportion standards. The muscular depiction is more abstract, which could be perceived as unrealistic from a physical realism standpoint.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the fine details such as facial features, hair texture, and ornamental lines clearly visible and unbroken in the edited version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the facial features are obscured, the hair texture and ornamental lines are depicted with high contrast and bold outlines. The neon coloration emphasizes lines and textures, but it may lack some finer details due to the stylized approach focusing on vibrant fills over intricate line work.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the central figure properly aligned within the circular frame, with no misalignment or distortion of the bordering geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the central figure in a more dynamic pose with vibrant contrasting colors. While bold and visually striking, the alignment within the circular frame seems adjusted, and geometric shapes appear more abstract, potentially causing distortion when compared to original positioning and layout, reflecting a change in alignment.",
    "answer": "No"
