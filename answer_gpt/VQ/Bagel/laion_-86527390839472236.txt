    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed object maintain a tall, rectangular silhouette with smooth, continuous vertical sides and no visible warping or collapsed edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a perfume bottle that has an elongated and symmetrical silhouette. The sides are smoothly curved rather than rectangular, indicating a bulbous shape. The glass maintains its form without warping or collapse. Using world knowledge, perfume bottles are often designed with such contours for aesthetic appeal, suggesting a harmonious and continuous design without edges akin to a suitcase. Therefore, Image B does not maintain a tall, rectangular silhouette like the suitcase in Image A.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the retractable handle replaced by a metallic spray nozzle that appears seamlessly attached to the top of the vessel, with no visible seams or material discontinuities?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a metallic spray nozzle at the top, appearing as a continuous design element with the bottle. Perfume bottles usually have stylish nozzles that match the aesthetics of the bottle, often appearing seamless to enhance visual appeal. Image A had a handle typical of luggage, distinct from the body, whereas Image B shows uniform integration of the nozzle into the design. Based on this analysis, the retractable handle has indeed been replaced by a metallic spray nozzle seamlessly attached.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the fabric panels replaced with translucent purple-tinted glass that shows uniform translucency and clearly defined embossed linear patterns matching the original seam locations?",
    "explanation": "On examining Image B, the material visible is translucent purple-tinted glass. The glass seems smooth and maintains a uniform transparency, showcasing delicate embossed linear patterns. While the suitcase in Image A has fabric panels typically without transparency, the linear patterns on Image B's bottle mirror the seams often found on luggage. This provides a thoughtful design transition, preserving aesthetics through material change.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the logo positioned near the top center of the front face and rendered as a clean, subtle etching on the glass surface without any visible digital artifacts or blurring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the etched details are not visible or clearly discernible on the glass surface, contrasting with typical logos which are clear identifiers. Image A's suitcase displayed a well-positioned logo prominently near the top center. Image B does not reflect any clear etched logo details, leading to the conclusion that the position and rendering are absent or not matching the suitcase's format.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the four wheels replaced with identical decorative caps at each corner of the base, appearing as solid, polished elements without exposed mechanical parts or asymmetry?",
    "explanation": "The base of Image B does not have four separate decorative caps resembling what the wheels would be on the suitcase in Image A. Image B shows continuous glass, commonly found in perfume bottles without any element resembling wheels or decorative caps at the corners. Hence, there are no visible decorative elements identical to caps replacing wheels here.",
    "answer": "No"
