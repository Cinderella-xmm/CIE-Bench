    "Question": "Q1: Are the two towers and the central wall of the fortress proportionally reduced without distortion or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress appears to be a scaled-down model, but retains the architectural integrity seen in the original. The proportions of the towers and wall are consistent, and there is no visible distortion in their geometry. The miniature version captures the essence and symmetry of a fortress without any geometric inconsistencies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the moss covering the ground exhibit natural texture and color gradients, resembling real moss rather than a uniform or painted surface?",
    "explanation": "The moss in Image B is depicted with texture variations and subtle color gradients, which are typical characteristics of real moss. The surface is not flat or uniformly colored, which enhances the authenticity of its appearance in the miniature setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the model knights positioned on the moss at a scale consistent with the miniature fortress, and do they rest fully on the ground without floating or intersecting with other elements?",
    "explanation": "Each knight figure in Image B is scaled proportionally to the fortress model and appears to be securely resting on the moss surface. There is no visual indication of floating or inappropriate intersections with the moss or other elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the faux stone pathways extend from the fortress base onto the moss with consistent texture and alignment, matching the original stonework without gaps or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pathways are crafted to match the texture and alignment found in real stone pathways and are seamless as they transition from the fortress to the surrounding moss. The design appears continuous without visible gaps or misalignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the glass star transparent and reflective, positioned precisely at the top of the central tower's spire without overlapping or deforming the underlying structure?",
    "explanation": "The transparent glass star in Image B is accurately positioned atop the spire of the central tower. Its reflective quality does not distort the structure beneath, and it is situated without overlapping or creating any deformations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the terrarium dome smoothly curved and transparent, enclosing the fortress without visible seams, warping, or optical distortions?",
    "explanation": "The dome in Image B is depicted as a smooth, transparent cover with no visible seams or warping. The enclosure is even and creates no optical distortion over the miniature fortress, maintaining clarity and a seamless boundary.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the wooden stand beneath the terrarium have visible wood grain, weathering, and design details consistent with vintage craftsmanship, and does it securely support the dome?",
    "explanation": "The wooden stand in Image B displays detailed grain and weathering textures reminiscent of vintage craftsmanship. It also has ornate design elements that contribute to its antique appearance. The stand securely holds the dome without any signs of instability.",
    "answer": "Yes"
