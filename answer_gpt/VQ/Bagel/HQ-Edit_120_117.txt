    "Question": "Q1: Is the outer surface of the globe smooth and uniformly curved without visible distortion or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the outer surface of the globe appears smooth and uniformly curved, as evidenced by the absence of any visible distortion or jagged edges along the perimeter of the globe. The image depicts a seamless spherical shape, indicative of a well-crafted spherical object. This observation aligns with common manufacturing and design practices for globes and similar spherical objects.",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the miniature lighthouse inside the globe have accurate window placements and structural symmetry matching the original lighthouse?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature lighthouse is observed to be a simplified and artistic representation. The window placements and structural symmetry do not closely match Image Aâ€™s original lighthouse, which has a more detailed architectural design. Typically, miniatures may lack the precise details due to their scale. Thus, Image B prioritizes a stylized appearance over exact replication.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the waves made of translucent blue resin visually continuous with smooth surfaces and subtle internal reflections, showing no blocky or fragmented textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the waves appear to be crafted in a way that suggests they are made from a translucent blue material, likely resin. The depiction shows smooth, continuous surfaces with subtle internal reflections, which is characteristic of resin used in artistic representations. There are no visible blocky or fragmented textures, making the waves appear fluid and dynamic.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the wooden base flat and grounded beneath the globe, with visible wood grain and engraved lines that follow a consistent radial pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base beneath the globe is depicted as flat and stable, providing support to the globe. There is visible wood grain, and engraved lines follow a consistent radial pattern, which is typical of such designed pieces to maintain aesthetic and structural balance. This reflects common craftsmanship in creating decorative bases.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the painted clouds and distant mountains located behind the globe, creating a sense of depth without overlapping or intersecting with the globe's surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the painted clouds and distant mountains are positioned in a manner that suggests they are part of a backdrop, located behind the globe. This arrangement creates a sense of depth by visually separating the background from the globe itself, as they do not intersect or overlap with the globe's outer surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Do the rocks display earthy brown and green tones while the water shows vibrant blue with gradient shading, maintaining color harmony across the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rocks are depicted with earthy brown and green tones, while the water is shown in vibrant blue with gradient shading. The combination of these colors maintains visual harmony, as earthy tones often complement vibrant blues in naturalistic and artistic scenes. This use of color aligns with common artistic techniques for creating visually cohesive environments.",
    "answer": "Yes"
