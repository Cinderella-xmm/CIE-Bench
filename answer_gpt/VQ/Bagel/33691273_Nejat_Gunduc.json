        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the man's head position appears natural, and the placement of his hand near his ear suggests a contemplative pose common in introspective or thoughtful moments. The visual cues do not indicate any distortion or unnatural joint angles, adhering to typical human anatomy.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the thought bubbles properly aligned with the man’s head, drawn with consistent line quality, and free from pixelation or overlapping distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The thought bubbles in the edited image are positioned appropriately above the man's head, maintaining consistent line quality that matches the style of the image. They appear free from pixelation or overlapping distortions, indicating good alignment and quality.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the man’s figure cast a consistent shadow or interact with the billboard surface in a way that preserves spatial depth and avoids floating or disconnected appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's figure is integrated with the billboard surface without any signs of floating or disconnection. The spatial depth is preserved with shadows that correspond logically to the placement of elements and the light source direction.",
