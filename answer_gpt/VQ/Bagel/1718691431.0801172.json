    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features of the fox mask (eyes, nose, mouth) aligned symmetrically and proportionally, without any stretched or deformed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the fox mask appear symmetrical and proportionally balanced. The eyes, nose, and mouth follow clean lines that mirror each other on either side of the mask, reflecting an artistic and intentional layout. World knowledge suggests these features are designed with aesthetic symmetry in mind, typical for stylized artworks of this nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the kimono replaced with clean, geometric motifs that follow consistent lines and shapes, without blurred or fragmented edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a transformation from floral patterns to geometric motifs on the kimono. These motifs present strong, clean lines that maintain consistency and order throughout the design. World knowledge and visual assessment confirm the absence of blurring or fragmented edges, typical of well-rendered graphics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the colors on the kimono and mask transition smoothly between deep reds, pale pinks, and metallic tones without visible color bleeding or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors on the kimono and mask are strategically placed with smooth transitions between shades. The deep reds, pale pinks, and accompanying tones show a controlled color palette, which helps avoid color bleeding and maintains consistent shading. This is evident through clear demarcations of color regions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the kimono retain a natural drape and fold structure, with no unnatural flattening or stretching of fabric that would disrupt physical plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the kimono in stylized, graphic form with patterns suggesting structure but not needing physical fabric representation. However, due to its graphic design, the drape is suggested through consistent motifs that avoid disruptive flattening. World knowledge on artistic design helps explain the shift away from plausible fabric simulation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the fox mask and kimono free from jagged edges, pixelation, or texture seams that suggest incomplete rendering or editing errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a highly stylized illustration where smooth lines dominate the design of the mask and kimono. The absence of jagged edges, pixelation, or visible texture seams indicates careful rendering work, reaffirming the visual integrity of the edited image.",
