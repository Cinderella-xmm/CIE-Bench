      "question": "Does the lattice-like scale pattern along the serpent's body follow the spiral curve smoothly without abrupt breaks or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent features a lattice-like scale pattern running along its body. To evaluate whether this pattern follows the spiral curve smoothly, we should observe how the scales align along the body of the serpent. The scales should continue without any obvious breaks or misalignment as the serpent snakes through the spiral staircase, indicating a harmonious integration with the stair's curves. Upon inspection, the scale pattern seems to consistently curve with the serpent's form, supporting the overall spiral appearance without visible disruptions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the individual segments of the serpent's body aligned with the original stair treads such that each segment corresponds to a step in size and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if each segment of the serpent's body is aligned with the stair treads, we need to analyze how the serpent's body is positioned relative to the steps. Solid-align laying signifies that each part of the serpent should rest on or correspond with a step feature. In this case, the serpent coils through the staircase, but does not exhibit a precise alignment where each body segment matches the size and spacing of the stairs' treads.",

      "question": "Do the translucent fins extend from the original railing position in a continuous, flowing manner without gaps or distortions in their shape or placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original staircase image (Image A) depicts a spiral stair with a detailed railing design. In Image B, there seems to be the addition of features resembling translucent fins along the serpent. To answer this question, one would expect these extensions to arise from where the railing would be, blending smoothly into the design. However, the serpent's design does not incorporate any visible translucent fins extending from the original railing location, suggesting that the fins do not exist in a continuous fashion occupying the railing space.",

      "question": "Is the marble-like texture on the serpent’s body evenly distributed and consistent with the lighting and shading of the original staircase surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent's body displays a lustrous marble-like texture, which should be analyzed for even distribution and consistency with lighting and shading. Examining Image B, this texture appears uniformly applied across the serpent’s body. The serpent's shading complements the lighting present in the stairwell, suggesting that the texture does consistently match the illumination and shadowing seen on the staircase surface, which showcases a similarly intricate pattern.",

      "question": "Is the serpent’s head positioned within the circular opening at the top of the staircase without overlapping or deforming the surrounding wall or ceiling structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent’s head should ideally be positioned within the circular opening at the upper portion of the spiral staircase without interfering with the surrounding structures. Observing this arrangement, the serpent's head protrudes through the central opening designed in the staircase. It fits within the circle, avoiding any overlaps or deformation with walls or ceiling in the depicted architecture of the original staircase.",
