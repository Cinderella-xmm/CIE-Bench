      "question": "Are the body proportions and movements in the line art consistent and natural throughout the four frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The line art in Image B shows a sequence of tennis moves. The overall body proportions appear to be consistent, with arms, legs, and torso drawn in a realistic manner. The movements also portray a natural progression of tennis strokes commonly seen in real-life scenarios, starting from preparation to follow-through.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the tennis racket and the ball retain their realistic textures and details without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis racket and ball are depicted as line drawings, lacking the fine textures and details of a realistic depiction. They are simplified for clarity while maintaining recognizable shapes. Since the question asks about realistic textures, the line art doesn't achieve that due to its monochrome style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand's position and grip on the racket depicted naturally and ergonomically in each of the four frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand's position and grip on the racket in Image B are depicted in a way that aligns with conventional tennis techniques. The grip looks natural and appropriate for the different phases of playing the shot, suggesting an understanding of ergonomics and realistic positioning.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the removal of the background and the application of monochrome colors preserve visual clarity without causing any distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The removal of the background and use of monochrome colors in Image B helps focus on the player's movement and each stage of the tennis action. This method maintains clarity about the body's position and movement without any significant distortion; however, the loss of detail is inherent to a simplified line drawing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sequence of actions from preparation to follow-through in the clean line art style visually coherent and believable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sequence of actions is clearly delineated through the panels, showing the player progressing from preparation to follow-through in a coherent and believable manner. Each step logically follows the previous one, creating a convincing depiction of a tennis sequence.",
