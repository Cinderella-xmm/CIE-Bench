      "question": "Do the metallic textures on the cyclist’s outfit and helmet reflect light consistently with the scene’s illumination and maintain accurate surface contours without warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents the cyclist's outfit and helmet with metallic textures that interact with light sources, creating reflections and highlights. These are typically consistent with the scene’s illumination when they follow the general direction of lighting and maintain surface integrity. The scene indicates controlled light effects without visible distortion of these surfaces, suggesting that the metallic textures look realistic and consistent across the contours.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the electric blue neon glow lines along the road edges and on the cyclist and car smooth, evenly lit, and free from jagged edges or overlapping with real-world details like tires or license plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Neon glow effects typically appear consistent and smooth when they follow the contours of objects without visible breaks or overlapping real-world elements. The brightness should be even across edges, enhancing visibility without disrupting existing element visibility like car tires or license plates. The edited image demonstrates these lines running evenly and aligning with intended objects without interference.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transparent visor data display on the cyclist’s helmet aligned with the helmet’s curvature, showing clear digital content without ghosting, blurring, or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A transparent visor display maintains clarity when it follows the helmet's curvature closely and presents digital content as intended. The visor should not show ghosting or distortion that would suggest poor integration with the curved surface. The edited image shows the display fitting neatly on the helmet, with digital information appearing clear and undisturbed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the holographic cycling stats near the escort car spatially coherent, appropriately sized relative to the car, and displayed with soft edges and ambient glow without casting incorrect shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Holographic displays generally appear realistic when they fit spatially within the visual scene, maintaining size proportionate to visible objects like the car. They should not cast shadows incompatible with their ethereal nature and should display ambient glow softly. The edited image seems to integrate the holographic stats within these spatial constraints, maintaining proper proportion without inappropriate shadow effects.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all edited elements—including metallic finishes, neon glows, digital visor display, and holographic projections—coexist without visual contradictions such as mismatched lighting, texture clashes, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For coherence among edited elements, all components should follow consistent lighting rules and textural harmony, avoiding contradiction in visual expression and shape conformity. The scene should flow naturally without elements appearing out of place or clashing visually. The edited image effectively integrates all these elements harmoniously, showing unified aesthetics without contradictions.",
