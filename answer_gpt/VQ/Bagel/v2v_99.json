      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D soccer player appear to blend seamlessly with the realistic soccer field and stadium without any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a chibi-style 3D soccer player placed in a realistic soccer field and stadium environment. The chibi-style character has exaggerated features typical of this artistic style, which contrasts sharply with the realistic environment. Such a clash in styles often leads to noticeable inconsistencies, as the textures and proportions of the cartoonish player starkly differ from the environment, making seamless blending difficult.",

      "question": "Are the soccer field, stadium, and cheering crowd still visually plausible and structurally coherent, without any distortions or unnatural textures introduced by the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background, including the soccer field, stadium, and cheering crowd, remains intact and visually coherent. The editing focuses on changing the player's style rather than the environment, which maintains its structural integrity and plausible appearance, indicating no noticeable distortions or unnatural textures have been introduced.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D soccer player maintain proper proportions and physical logic, avoiding any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style 3D soccer player in Image B intentionally uses exaggerated, non-realistic proportions as part of its artistic style, such as a larger head and shortened limbs. However, within the context of chibi art, these features are consistent and do not involve any actual distortions or broken geometric shapes. This style adheres to its own logical form rather than realistic proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the chibi-style 3D soccer player look natural and free of any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style 3D soccer player in Image B shows smooth textures and consistent material properties typical of 3D/cartoon characters. The colors and surfaces appear natural for this style, and there are no visible artifacts indicating issues with rendering or texturing within this artistic context.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the action pose of the chibi-style 3D soccer player consistent with the original image, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the original player is captured mid-kick, with a dynamic posture suggesting motion and strength. Image B's chibi-style player mirrors this pose, maintaining a similar energetic and athletic posture despite the different artistic style. The action pose is consistent with the original intent, preserving structural credibility even with the stylistic shift.",
