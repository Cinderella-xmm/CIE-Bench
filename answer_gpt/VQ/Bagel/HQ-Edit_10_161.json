      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the dress preserved as continuous, non-distorted shapes without broken edges or misaligned tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric patterns on the dress are represented as mosaic tiles, creating a textured and artistic effect. This transformation implies a change from smooth continuous shapes as seen in traditional textile designs to a tiled appearance, which can introduce some degree of distortion or misalignment due to the nature of mosaic construction. Thus, the patterns may not be preserved as continuous, non-distorted shapes because of the deliberate artistic style. Image A depicts a standard fabric pattern with smooth edges, while Image B uses mosaic-like tiles.",

      "question": "Do the necklaces appear as flat, transparent stained glass tiles with consistent color gradients and no jagged or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The necklaces in Image B are depicted using mosaic tiles which simulate stained glass effects, with various colors. While they do follow a stained glass style with distinct tiles, the nature of this artistic representation can often result in jagged or pixelated edges due to the delineation between glass segments, and inconsistent color gradients as different tiles may not seamlessly blend. Image A presents them as traditional beaded necklaces with smooth edges and consistent color, contrasting with the edited mosaic effect.",

      "question": "Are the individual braids still distinguishable and proportionally accurate, with smooth transitions between segments and no collapsed or fused strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the braids are represented with a mosaic style, creating an artistic interpretation that can lead to some distortion or merging between segments due to the tiling pattern itself. The artistic style might affect proportional accuracy and introduce a degree of fusion or collapse between strands compared to Image A, which presents realistically distinguishable and accurately proportioned braids.",

      "question": "Does the background display varied textures and elevation changes consistent with natural terrain, without uniform patches or unnatural color blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is transformed into a highly stylized, mosaic-like depiction, which affects natural textures and elevation changes. As a mosaic representation, the terrain appears more artistic with deliberate patterns and less realistic variation compared to natural terrain, exhibiting uniform patches and potentially unnatural color blending due to grouped mosaics. Image A displays a realistic background with varied textures consistent with natural landscapes.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bracelets on both arms symmetrically positioned, correctly numbered, and free from distortion such as stretching or overlapping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the bracelets using mosaic tiles that maintain the number and symmetry of the bracelets on both arms as seen in the original. However, the stylization may introduce distortion such as overlapping or stretching due to the mosaic construction which rearranges proportions and shapes. Image A displays bracelets traditionally, free from any distortion. The transformation to mosaic might compromise some aspects of symmetry or proportions.",
