    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the crystal facets on the sandcastle uniformly shaped and aligned with the original tower geometry, without any jagged or incomplete edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a display case with a crystal structure resembling a castle. The facets of the crystals are clear, smooth, and uniformly aligned, replicating the tower's geometry without any noticeable irregularities like jagged or incomplete edges, indicative of high-quality material and craftsmanship.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gemstones replace the seashells accurately in position and size, and do they exhibit smooth, reflective surfaces without floating above the sand or water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the gemstones are positioned at the base of the crystal structure, replacing the seashells. They exhibit smooth, reflective surfaces, indicative of crystalline materials, and are placed firmly without floating, maintaining the intended position and size, suggesting an intentional design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wave pattern on the frosted glass surface continuous and flowing, with no abrupt breaks or unnatural line interruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frosted glass surface of the display case in the edited image shows a wave pattern that is continuous and smooth, flowing seamlessly without abrupt breaks or interruptions. This design choice reflects craftsmanship focused on aesthetic harmony and coherence in wave representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the display case visible and straight, with no clipping or warping of the internal elements, and do they align with the perspective of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display case edges are visible and straight, enclosing the sculpture neatly. They show no signs of distortion or warping, and the alignment is consistent with the perspective, which suggests care in design and editing for visual coherence and clarity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the red shovel with yellow handle fully visible and undistorted, lying flat on the surface without intersecting or appearing behind glass where it shouldnâ€™t be?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not have a red shovel or any other external objects like those present in the original beach scene. Given the scene's transformation into a glass display case, a shovel would be expected to be absent or differently depicted to fit the image's context.",
