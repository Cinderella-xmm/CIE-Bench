    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed dress exhibit smooth, flowing fabric folds consistent with celestial robes, without visible pixelation, unnatural sheen, or disrupted geometric patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dress is depicted as a celestial robe which generally requires smooth transitions and natural flow indicative of fine fabrics. The dress showcases a consistent flow and elegant curvature suggestive of weightless celestial attire. There is no visible pixelation or unnatural sheen disrupting the visual harmony, nor are there geometric patterns that conflict with the perception of a celestial robe.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the gold and silver filigree details aligned with the fabricâ€™s surface and lighting direction, showing no floating or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "The gold and silver filigree details on the dress should conform to the shape and folds of the fabric, reflecting the lighting direction naturally. In Image B, these details appear seamlessly integrated into the fabric, with no signs of misalignment or floating edges, suggesting careful attention to the interaction between fabric and embellishment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the clouds beneath the figure have volumetric form and gradient shading that match the perspective and scale of the scene, avoiding flat or cartoonish rendering?",
    "explanation": "Volumetric form and gradient shading are important in depicting realistic clouds. In Image B, the clouds exhibit gradient shading and volumetric depth that aligns with the scene's perspective and scale, avoiding a flat or overly simplistic (cartoonish) appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Is the starry night sky blended smoothly with dawn hues near the horizon, maintaining consistent illumination and avoiding abrupt color transitions or misplaced stars?",
    "explanation": "For a naturalistic depiction, the transition from a starry night to dawn hues should be smooth with gradual shifts in illumination. Image B presents a sky with a fluid blend of stars and dawn tones, maintaining a consistent flow without abrupt shifts in color or errant star placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do both hands show five distinct fingers with natural proportions and skin texture, and do the glowing wisps emerge from the palms without intersecting or distorting the hand structure?",
    "explanation": "In evaluating hands for natural proportions, each finger should be distinct, and the skin texture should appear realistic. In Image B, both hands have five clearly separate fingers with proportions that appear natural. The glowing wisps emanate from the palms without disrupting or distorting the hand structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
