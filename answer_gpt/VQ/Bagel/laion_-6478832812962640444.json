    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the areas previously featuring stitched embroidery (on the shaft and vamp) now display consistent metallic inlay textures with no visible seams, texture breaks, or mismatched gloss levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a boot with metallic inlays, where the surface appears smooth and consistent without visible seams or breaks. This uniform appearance is typical of high-quality metal finishes, suggesting that the boot's texture maintains an even gloss level across its surface. In comparison, Image A features a more traditional leather texture with stitched embroidery, which naturally has breaks and uneven textures due to the nature of stitching and leather grain.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the newly designed stepped heel structurally aligned with the sole and boot shaft, with clean geometric edges and no floating or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot features a stepped heel with geometric edges that align seamlessly with the sole and shaft, displaying clean lines indicative of careful structural design. There are no visible signs of misalignment or floating segments. Image A shows a standard stacked leather heel, more traditional in appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the transformed patterns along the shaft and toe area composed of sharp, consistent geometric lines without distorting the boot's outline or causing unnatural swelling or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays patterns on the boot that are composed of sharp geometric lines, maintaining the boot's natural outline without any distortion. The lines are consistent, contributing to a sleek and futuristic appearance. In contrast, Image A shows traditional embroidery with natural variations and curves typical of stitched designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the metallic inlays exhibit uniform specular highlights without bright spots, halos, or uneven reflections that suggest digital noise or over-processing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic inlays display specular highlights that are evenly distributed across the surface, indicative of high-quality metal finish with no bright spots, halos, or uneven reflections. This uniformity suggests careful handling of lighting and texture application, devoid of digital noise or signs of over-processing. Image A, with its leather material, reflects natural matte highlights common to this texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the boot maintain a natural foot-shaped profile with properly proportioned toe box, ankle, and shaft height, without unnatural elongation, compression, or asymmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a foot-shaped profile despite the radical design changes, with a proportioned toe box, ankle area, and shaft height that does not display unnatural elongation, compression, or asymmetry. This consistent profile indicates good design choices preserving ergonomics. Image A shows a traditional cowboy boot shape, inherently designed for foot comfort and proportion.",
