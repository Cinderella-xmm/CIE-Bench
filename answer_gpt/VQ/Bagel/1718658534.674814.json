      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the surface of the figurine exhibit a uniform glossy finish consistent with ceramic material, without patches of retained knit texture or uneven sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine has a shiny, reflective surface, indicative of a glazed ceramic finish. This can be deduced from the way light is reflecting off its surface and the absence of texture granularity that would indicate knitting. The consistent shine across the figure suggests a uniform glossy finish characteristic of ceramic materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the floral engravings clearly defined, proportionally scaled, and seamlessly embedded into the surface of the figurine without causing geometric distortions or overlapping inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral engravings are distinctly visible and well-defined on the surface of the figurine. They are proportional to the size of the figurine, seamlessly embedded without causing any distortions. There are no overlaps or inconsistencies in their alignment, suggesting good craftsmanship.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B clearly rests on a flat wooden surface. The visible wood grain adds to its natural look, and the shadow beneath the figurine provides depth, coherence, and evidence of proper physical support, affirming its spatial correctness.",
