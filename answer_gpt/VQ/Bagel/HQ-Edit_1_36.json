      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and skin texture on the elder’s face naturally rendered without excessive smoothing or artificial cartoon-like distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall aesthetic of the image suggests a cartoon-like depiction, as evidenced by the stylized and vibrant colors of the hanbok. This cartoon style typically involves smoothing features, giving them an artificial appearance. Considering the predominant style in the edited image, the facial details likely follow the same exaggerated aesthetic.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns on the hanbok in Image B are vibrant and exhibit a consistent design style. The surrounding foliage and floral accents in the border maintain harmony with the hanbok’s patterns, suggesting thoughtful design alignment and clarity. The absence of visible repetition or blurring demonstrates attention to detail.",

      "question": "Is the gradient transition across the hanbok's fabric smooth and continuous, with no sharp color breaks or unnatural banding effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hanbok features a gradient transition across the fabric with soft color blending. The colors smoothly transition from one hue to another, without evident breaks or banding effects, indicating a carefully executed gradient effect in line with the cartoon style of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the green vine accents positioned behind the subject and aligned with the depth of the background, without appearing to float above or through solid structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral vine accents in Image B appear as part of the border, suggesting a deliberate overlay to frame the subject. This design choice makes the vines seem to float above the background as a decorative element, not meant to naturally align with a realistic depth perspective.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The envelope frame in Image B is designed as part of the overall composition, with smooth edges and consistent shadowing. There are no visible errors in alignment, clipping or mismatched shading, indicating a well-integrated frame within the edited image.",
