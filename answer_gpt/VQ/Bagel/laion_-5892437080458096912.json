      "question": "Does the gold necklace at the neck area have smooth, continuous lines without jagged edges or pixelation, and does it integrate seamlessly with the surrounding skin and garment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the necklace appears to have smooth lines without jagged edges, indicating high-quality rendering typical for digital edits. The integration with the skin and garment looks seamless, without visible transitions or pixelation artifacts at the boundary areas, which suggests careful attention to detail during editing to maintain harmony between necklace and the rest of the attire.",

      "question": "Is the golden satin material on the gown uniformly textured with consistent light reflection, and do the geometric embroidery patterns follow logical symmetry and spacing without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden satin in Image B shows a smooth, reflective texture characteristic of satin fabrics, indicating consistent light reflection across the material. The geometric embroidery patterns are logically symmetrical and spaced well around the gown, showing no signs of distortion or irregular spacing, which suggests a well-crafted design adhering to common garment standards.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the exposed shoulders anatomically accurate with natural skin tone and texture, and are the Greek motifs clearly defined and properly aligned with the shoulder structure without overlapping or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the exposed shoulders reflect natural anatomy and skin tone similar to real human skin, with appropriate texturing evident from visual cues. The Greek motifs on the garment appear clearly defined and are correctly aligned with the shoulder, without any signs of overlapping or warping, illustrating meticulous alignment in the design.",

      "question": "Does the background scene feature coherent lighting, realistic proportions of olive trees and columns, and a seamless integration with the figure’s silhouette without visible edges or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a background scene with balanced lighting, consistent across elements like olive trees and columns, maintaining realistic proportions. The integration between the figure’s silhouette and the background appears seamless, with no visible misalignment or edges suggesting proper blending techniques to ensure harmony in the visual composition.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand near the waist have five distinct fingers with natural joint angles, smooth skin texture, and proper shadowing consistent with the light source, without any added or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand visible in Image B displays five distinct fingers with physiologically accurate joint angles. The skin texture appears smooth, and the shadowing consistent with the observed light source, without any added or missing digits. This suggests attention to detail in maintaining anatomical correctness and realistic dimensioning.",
