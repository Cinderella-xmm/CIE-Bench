      "question": "Are the wooden beams and roof supports rendered as consistent geometric shapes with sharp, clean edges and no warped or fractured sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden beams and roof supports are abstractly represented with bold, angular lines and geometric shapes that are consistent and clean, indicating a stylized design. This style focuses on sharp, clean edges, deviating from a natural or wooden appearance to a more graphic one. These lines align with the notion of geometric precision common in stylized, abstract art. Therefore, the representation in Image B adheres to a consistent geometric style without any warping or fractures.",

      "question": "Is the moon a perfectly round shape with a smooth surface and uniform glow around its edge, without jagged outlines or uneven brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the celestial object that resembles the moon is depicted as a perfectly circular shape. It features smooth and precise edges, consistent with graphic design principles, emphasizing seamless forms. Unlike the realistic depiction one might expect, where the moon has varying brightness due to craters and surface texture, this representation is uniform. The glow around it is evenly distributed, maintaining consistency with the stylized representation.",

      "question": "Are the plants in the foreground and background arranged in symmetrical, repeating patterns without irregular spacing or fragmented shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plants are suggested through abstract lines and stylized representations that focus on repetitive and symmetrical aesthetics. This type of design often uses repetition and symmetry to create visually appealing patterns that align well with geometric and orderly appearance expectations. The shapes and patterns of the plants do not appear fragmented or irregular within the context of stylized art, maintaining harmony and uniformity.",

      "question": "Do the wooden surfaces and glass panes display metallic gold and silver accents with consistent sheen and reflection, without color bleeding or missing texture details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces that would traditionally be wooden or glass are portrayed using bold, alternating colors of metallic gold and silver, reflecting a deliberate choice to abstract and stylize the elements. The use of these colors is consistent across the surfaces, with clear distinctions and no visible color bleeding, characteristic of precise, graphic design. The treatment simulates a sheen effect found in metallic objects, prioritizing bold visual impact over realistic texture or material depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the stylized clouds positioned above the horizon with smooth, flowing outlines and do the window frames show bold, angular lines that align with the architectural style without breaking the windowâ€™s structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are depicted with clean, sweeping curves that suggest smooth, flowing forms, typical of stylized art. These shapes are placed above the horizon line, maintaining a coherent landscape representation. Additionally, the window frames consist of bold, angular lines consistent with the geometric style seen throughout the edited image. These align well with the overall architectural style depicted here, avoiding any disruption to the structural integrity as typically understood in stylized representations where form and function are idealized.",
