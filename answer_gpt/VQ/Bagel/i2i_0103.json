      "question": "Have the brushstrokes added to the sofa preserved its structural integrity without causing distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa is depicted with Van Gogh-style brushstrokes, characterized by swirling patterns and bold colors that are typical of his artworks. Despite this stylistic change, the sofa maintains its structural form and clarity, as the outlines and proportions remain consistent without signs of distortion. The brushstrokes enhance the color and texture but do not compromise the sofa's overall shape or function.",

      "question": "Does the wall, including the framed painting, appear naturally integrated with the rest of the room after the style conversion, without any broken geometric shapes or lost fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the wall with Van Gogh's characteristic swirling patterns, which seamlessly blend with the painting's style in the frame. The integration of the wall and painting is smooth, as the patterns flow continuously without disrupting the wall's geometric structure or losing detail. The scene retains its coherence, with the painting appearing as a natural focal point despite the stylistic transformation.",

      "question": "Are the plant's leaves depicted with Van Gogh-style brushstrokes while still retaining a recognizable and plausible appearance without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plant in Image B is transformed using Van Gogh-style brushstrokes, imparting a unique texture and vibrant color to the leaves while preserving their recognizable form. The brushstrokes are applied in a way that enhances the plant's natural shape and contours, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or distortions. The leaves remain plausible and identifiable as part of the Van Gogh style interpretation.",

      "question": "Has the side table and lamp been converted to fit the Van Gogh style while preserving their realistic proportions and physical logic, avoiding any distortion or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side table and lamp exhibit Van Gogh-style brushstrokes, reflected in their textural detail and vibrant colors. Despite the stylistic conversion, these items maintain their realistic proportions and structure, clearly preserved through the brushwork. The logical arrangement of the lamp on the table and the clarity of their physical forms demonstrate that no significant distortion or detail loss has occurred.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all elements, including the sofa, wall, painting, plant, side table, and lamp, are reinterpreted in a Van Gogh style. The spatial relationships among these objects are retained, allowing for a harmonious and cohesive scene. The conversion to Van Gogh's style adds a unifying visual theme without disrupting the logical arrangement or introducing discordance into the spatial dynamics within the room.",
