    "Question": "Q1: Are the LEGO brick structures aligned with the original sock’s contours, maintaining consistent proportions and avoiding warped or stretched geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO brick sculpture replicates the shape and overall proportions of the sock shown in Image A. The structure seems to capture the 3D curvature and contour of the sock, preserving its silhouette without distortion. This is derived from the alignment and overall coherence seen in the brick sculpture, which appears to mimic the original sock's form without any noticeable warping or stretching.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the layered LEGO bricks follow the natural curves of the sock, forming a cohesive 3D structure without gaps or misaligned layers?",
    "explanation": "Image B exhibits a well-organized construction of LEGO bricks that form a smooth and continuous 3D representation of the sock seen in Image A. The bricks are arranged in a manner that cohesively follow the curves and contours of the sock, with no visible gaps between layers or misalignments that could disrupt the overall appearance. The continuity and coherence in the layers suggest a meticulous assembly that respects the sock's natural curves.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the black, gray, and white LEGO bricks arranged to match the original sock's pattern layout, including the 'UNO' text and accent stripes, without color inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the color arrangement of the LEGO bricks mirrors the pattern and color scheme of the sock from Image A. The LEGO sculpture manages to emulate the complex design and placement of colors, including the 'UNO' text and surrounding striped accents. This suggests an intentional and careful replication of the sock's pattern layout using the available colors, without visible inconsistencies in color placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the orange LEGO piece positioned at the top of the cuff and integrated into the brick structure without floating or unnatural attachment?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the orange LEGO piece integrated at the top of the structure, in a similar way to the orange label found on the cuff of the sock in Image A. The positioning and integration of this piece appear natural in the structure, with no indications of it floating or being unnaturally attached. The cohesive integration suggests careful construction to replicate the sock’s design elements accurately.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sculpture presented upright against a clean, uniform background with even lighting that highlights its 3D form without casting unnatural shadows or reflections?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the LEGO sculpture upright against a clean, uniform backdrop, which is similar to the setup used for the sock in Image A. The lighting in the image appears evenly distributed, effectively highlighting the sculpture's three-dimensional form without causing distracting shadows or reflections. This presentation aids in perceiving the structure's details clearly and maintains a consistent visual standard.",
    "answer": "Yes"
