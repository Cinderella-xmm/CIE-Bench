      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the jagged wing structures formed from the mountain peaks have smooth transitions between rock and ice, and do they follow the natural slope and ridge lines without abrupt geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain peaks are transformed into jagged wing structures, which appear distinctively artificial compared to natural mountain formations. The transitions between the ice and rock are not smooth; instead, they have abrupt and geometric distortions that do not follow natural slope and ridge lines. The shapes are sharp and stylized, characteristic of an edited or artificial design, rather than a natural geological formation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scale-like patterns on the lake surface uniformly spaced and reflective, with no visible repetition, pixelation, or mismatched light reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lake surface features scale-like patterns, which are reflective and stylized to resemble scales, showing uniform spacing to an extent. However, upon closer inspection, there are areas where pixelation and mismatched light reflections occur, which are indicative of digital editing. Natural water surfaces do not exhibit such uniform, reflective patterns, indicating the artificial alteration of the surface.",

      "question": "Does the peninsula resemble a continuous, tapering tail with natural curvature and surface texture, and are there no sudden breaks or unnatural bulges in its shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the peninsula is designed to resemble a tail as part of a mythical creature's anatomy. While it shows some curvature and surface detail, there are noticeable breaks and bulges that do not follow a coherent, tapering structure. These features suggest artificial shaping rather than a natural landform, indicating this area has been altered in a way that doesn't fully mimic natural geological shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the house structures reshaped into a linear metallic spine that lies flat on the ground with consistent material shading and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the houses are transformed into a linear structure that suggests a metallic spine. This transformation results in a structure that is noticeably flat and lacking the dimensionality and shading consistency that would suggest a naturally lying object on the ground. Furthermore, there are parts that appear disconnected, which breaks the continuity expected from an intact spine-like structure.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the cloud eyes have clear, symmetrical pupil and iris structures, and are they seamlessly integrated into the existing cloud layer without visible borders or color discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, though it creatively suggests the presence of cloud features like eyes, does not exhibit distinct, clear, or symmetrical pupil and iris structures. There are visible borders and color discontinuities indicating these features are not seamlessly integrated into the cloud layer, showcasing clear signs of digital manipulation rather than naturally occurring cloud formations.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the grass fur consistently aligned in a single direction across the field, with natural-looking flow and no clumped or artificially drawn streaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed grass to fur on the field does not maintain a single-direction flow. The alignment is inconsistent, and there are artificial-looking streaks and clumps that are not characteristic of grass or fur, suggesting an unnatural or edited appearance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, duplicated textures, or lighting mismatches between the transformed elements (wings, scales, tail, spine, fur) and the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are evident seams, duplicated textures, and lighting mismatches between the transformed elements such as wings, scales, tail, spine, and fur, and the surrounding natural environment. These discrepancies highlight the artificial nature of the editing, as natural elements would normally exhibit seamless integration into their environment without such discontinuities.",
