      "question": "Does the robot's body exhibit smooth, continuous chrome-like surfaces without visible texture breaks or inconsistent material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is depicted with angular, geometric shapes, consistent with a stylized, cubist or abstract design. This design choice involves sharp edges and distinct flat color panels rather than smooth, continuous surfaces or realistic chrome textures. The robot in Image B does not have smooth chrome surfaces; instead, it reflects a design that prioritizes geometric abstraction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the flamingos rendered as cohesive geometric shapes with consistent edges and proportions, without fragmented or disconnected components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flamingos are presented with stylized geometric designs. They appear as consistent abstract forms with clean lines and connected components, adhering to a coherent artistic style where each element flows into the next without appearing fragmented.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the palm trees and rocks in the background have angular, stylized forms that maintain consistent perspective and spatial relationships without appearing disjointed or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements such as palm trees and rocks are rendered in a stylized and angular manner, characteristic of art movements like cubism or futurism. These elements are composed with consistent spatial relationships, maintaining a balanced and harmonious aesthetic without appearing disjointed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the color palette across the entire scene consistently muted and pastel-toned, with no areas exhibiting sudden or jarring color deviations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is characterized by a muted and pastel-tone color palette, chosen to reflect an artistic and surreal quality. Throughout the image, there is a consistent application of these tones, with no parts showing sudden, jarring deviations, maintaining visual harmony.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the robot's hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural curvature and spacing, and no extra or malformed digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's hands are stylized with attention to artistic abstraction rather than anatomical accuracy. The hands are rendered with an angular, geometric form that does not conform to realistic representations of five fingers with natural curvature and spacing. Instead, they follow the geometric style of the rest of the composition.",
