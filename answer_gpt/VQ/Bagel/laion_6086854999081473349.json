    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the bark textures on the logs continuous and aligned with the original log shapes, showing no abrupt edges or inconsistent scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bark textures have been replaced with designs of intertwined vines that create a mystical appearance. The vine designs are artistically consistent across the structure, showing creativity rather than trying to represent continuous wooden log textures seen in Image A. Thus, the continuity and alignment are intentionally altered for visual effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glowing amber eyes fit precisely within the original window openings without distorting the surrounding log structure or spreading light beyond the intended area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are part of large faces on the garage doors. They replace the structure where windows might be in the original design, but they donâ€™t conform precisely to any original opening, and their glowing effect extends beyond a confined space without adhering strictly to a structural design intent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the leafy canopy extend upward from the roof ridge in a natural, gravity-consistent manner, with leaves overlapping logically and not appearing suspended or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leafy canopy is depicted as a green coverage on the top of the structure, with leaves seemingly integrated with the roof. The design aims for fantasy and whimsy rather than natural realism, yet it convincingly depicts gravity-consistent leaf placement without suspension or detachment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the vines and moss growing along the logs and roofline in a way that follows natural climbing patterns, with no flat, disconnected patches or unnatural straight lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows vines and moss wrapping the building with flowing, organic patterns that resemble natural climbing plants. There are no flat or disconnected patches; vines are logically distributed and appear to follow a continuity of natural growth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the runes carved into the logs with consistent depth and alignment, following the roundness of the logs and not appearing as flat or misaligned symbols?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, runes are depicted on the surface of the logs. The design considers artistic placement but does not strictly follow consistent depth and alignment due to the fantasy theme, making them appear more flat and stylistically positioned rather than realistically carved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the forest spirit faces positioned within the original garage door frames, with facial features properly scaled and energy trails flowing outward in a smooth, non-jagged manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spirit faces in Image B are innovatively placed within and around the garage doors' areas. They are scaled to cover these openings and the energy trails emitting from them are designed to flow smoothly with an artistic intent that forgoes any structural distortion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all structural components (logs, roof, canopy, vines, faces) connected seamlessly without gaps, floating elements, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all elements like the logs, roof, canopy, vines, and faces appear interconnected with aesthetic consistency, merging elements without visible gaps or distorted geometry. The alterations effectively blend fantasy elements with structural integrity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
