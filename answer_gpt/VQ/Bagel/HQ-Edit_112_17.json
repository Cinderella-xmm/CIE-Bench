      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the hammer's handle display a uniform deep blue enamel surface with no visible cracks, rough patches, or color variations, and does the head show realistic metallic sheen with consistent reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer is visually characterized by a deep blue enamel handle, which appears smooth and uniformly colored, lacking any visible imperfections such as cracks or rough patches. The head of the hammer shows a shiny, metallic appearance, reflecting light consistently, which is indicative of a well-polished metal surface. This consistency in the visual representation is crucial for portraying realism. Based on these observations, the hammer's handle and head in Image B meet the specified requirements.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the chisel, file, wrench, and pliers retain their original shapes and proportions, with smooth, reflective enamel surfaces and no warped edges, missing details, or inconsistent material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tools listed—the chisel, file, wrench, and pliers—maintain their expected shapes and proportions. Each tool exhibits a smooth, reflective enamel surface with no visible distortions or warped edges. Additionally, the transitions between different parts of the tools appear seamless, without any missing details or inconsistencies. This analysis confirms that the tools adhere to the criteria of preserving their original design while displaying an enamel coating.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the enamel shavings shaped into natural-looking curls with varied thickness and smooth, glossy surfaces, avoiding flat or rigid appearances and maintaining fine detail along the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the enamel shavings as organically curled pieces with varied thickness, mimicking the irregularity and curl found in real shavings. The surfaces appear smooth and glossy, consistent with the enamel finish, and the edges maintain fine detail, avoiding the appearance of being flat or rigid. These characteristics demonstrate a successful representation of enamel shavings that maintain a naturalistic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the linen fabric background show a natural weave texture with soft folds and slight color variation, and does it provide a visually coherent base for the enamel tools without appearing artificial or overly smooth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears to be a linen fabric with a discernible weave texture, evident from its fine fabric pattern and subtle color variations. There are soft folds visible which contribute to the realism of the fabric surface, maintaining a natural look rather than an artificial one. This fabric acts as an appropriate base for the enamel tools, enhancing the visual coherence of the entire composition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows and highlights on the enamel tools consistent with a single light source and the reflective nature of enamel, and do all tools rest naturally on the fabric without gaps, floating effects, or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light source seems to be consistent across the enamel tools, evident from the uniform directionality of shadows and the highlights on the reflective surfaces. The enamel tools appear to rest naturally on the fabric without any gaps or floating effects. The edges are aligned properly with the fabric base, supporting the realism of the scene. This consistent lighting and placement ensure that the tools' representation adheres to physical principles.",
