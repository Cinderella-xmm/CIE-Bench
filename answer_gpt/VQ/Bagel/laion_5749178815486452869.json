    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the green field appear to float above the starry background with clean, continuous edges and no visible distortions or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is depicted as a floating island with a surrounding blue sky and stars, with clean and continuous edges. The design follows a floating concept with no visible distortions or interruptions, giving the impression of a standalone set piece. The visual effect aligns with a floating island style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the yellow and red flowers vividly colored but free from unnatural texture artifacts or color fringing around their petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers are designed in a stylized manner with bright and vivid colors. However, the emphasis is more on a graphical and surreal style rather than photographic realism, which may include slight texture variations typical of artistic renditions. There is no significant color fringing or unnatural texture artifacts observed.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the apple-shaped object in the sky significantly larger than the tree and properly lit with consistent shading and texture, resembling a real fruit rather than a flat graphic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple-shaped object is indeed larger than any trees depicted within the scene, serving as a central visual anchor. It is rendered with consistent shading, and the reflective textures give it a three-dimensional appearance similar to a realistic fruit, despite being part of a surreal setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the insect figures (bee and butterfly) stylized but still identifiable, with smooth contours and no anatomical deformities or fragmented parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the insect figures, including a butterfly and other small stylized insects, are designed distinctly with recognizable features. They have smooth contours and are presented in a manner typical of surreal graphics without anatomical irregularities or broken elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the tree replaced by a hollow, angular geometric form with clean lines and internal voids, matching the surreal style without appearing fragmented or physically impossible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is not replaced by any geometric form; instead, it shows a stylized landscape and central apple construct. Therefore, the question's premise doesn't fully apply as no angular geometric form directly replaces a tree, maintaining a surreal but coherent presentation of visual elements.",
