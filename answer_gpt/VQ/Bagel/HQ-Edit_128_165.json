    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the bell-shaped body of the jellyfish have a consistent translucent appearance with no sharp edges, visible seams, or unnatural texture patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jellyfish's bell-shaped body is depicted with a smooth, translucent appearance typical of real jellyfish. It features gradual transitions in color and light without sharp edges, seams, or unnatural texture patches. This aligns with common characteristics of jellyfish, known for their fluid and seamless bodies.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tendrils extending from the jellyfish's body smooth, curved, and iridescent, with no angular distortions or segmented appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tendrils in Image B extend smoothly from the jellyfish's body, exhibiting natural curvature and iridescence. These tendrils lack angular distortions or segmented appearances. Such qualities are typical of jellyfish tendrils, which are often fluid and graceful.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the internal glowing patterns within the jellyfish's bell appear as natural, swirling bioluminescent designs without repeating geometric shapes or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents glowing patterns inside the jellyfish's bell with a natural, swirling bioluminescent appearance. They lack repeating geometric shapes or jagged edges, aligning with the organic and fluid patterns commonly found in bioluminescent sea creatures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing nodules along the tendrils softly illuminated with gradual light spread and positioned in a natural, non-uniform but plausible arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing nodules along the tendrils are softly illuminated, displaying a gradual spread of light. They are arranged in a non-uniform but plausible configuration, characteristic of natural arrangements in biological organisms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ambient lighting in the scene diffused and tinted with blue-green hues, and are there faint water particles or depth cues visible around the jellyfish, consistent with an underwater environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases ambient lighting that is diffused and tinted with blue-green hues. There are visible depth cues and faint particles surrounding the jellyfish, effectively suggesting an underwater environment, which aligns with the natural habitat of jellyfish.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the connection point between the jellyfish and the ceiling smooth and continuous, with no floating segments or abrupt breaks in structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jellyfish floats naturally in water, without any connection to a ceiling. Visually, it appears as a standalone entity within the water, consistent with jellyfish behavior, which do not anchor to surfaces in natural environments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
