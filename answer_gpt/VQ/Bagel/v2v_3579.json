      "question": "Do the sushi pieces forming the human figure maintain a natural and coherent structure without any visible breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image (Image B), the sushi pieces forming the map of the United States are placed in a coherent and structured manner. The pieces seem to maintain continuity without noticeable breaks. The sushi rolls are arranged to mimic the shape of the US map, which involves many small regions, each represented by sushi pieces. There are no visible distortions or gaps disrupting the intended map formation. Considering common map designs, coherence and continuity are crucial for accurate representation. Therefore, based on the visual cues and common design principles, the sushi arrangement appears uninterrupted and well-defined.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the sushi pieces used to form the human figure consistent with the original sushi map, without any unnatural color variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the sushi pieces appear consistent with typical sushi color palettes, including oranges from salmon, whites from rice, greens from cucumber or avocado, and black from nori seaweed. These colors are natural and expected in sushi composition and do not show any unusual color variations compared to Image A, which features similar color characteristics suitable for a sushi roll representation. The hues are representative of common ingredients found in sushi without any alteration or artificial modifications in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the edges of the sushi pieces forming the human figure sharp and well-defined, without any blurred or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inspecting Image B reveals that the edges of the sushi pieces are well-defined with clear outlines. The sushi rolls possess crisp boundaries, which maintain the visual integrity of the map design. The sharpness of edges is critical for distinguishing individual pieces and ensuring the map contours are accurate and recognizable. This sharpness can be compared to Image A, which also has clearly defined edges for the sushi pieces. There are no apparent signs of blurring or pixelation affecting the clarity of the edges in the edited image, maintaining consistency with the original quality.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sizes and shapes of the sushi pieces forming the human figure proportionate and realistic compared to the original sushi pieces, without any unnatural scaling or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases sushi pieces shaped and sized to fit into specific regions of the US map, which inherently requires varied dimensions. Despite each piece needing to fit distinct state shapes and sizes, they appear proportionate, maintaining realistic sushi dimensions seen in Image A. Each sushi maintains a consistent roll size without evident scale distortion, crucial for preserving a natural appearance and accurate representation. The comparison with Image A confirms that the proportions in Image B are consistent with expected sushi roll variations seen in such creative designs.",

      "question": "Does the positioning of the sushi pieces to form the lifted arm appear anatomically plausible, without any unnatural bends or angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not present a human figure or a lifted arm; rather, it exclusively forms a map of the United States via sushi pieces. Hence, there is no anatomy to assess regarding an arm or its positioning. Given this observation, the question concerning anatomical plausibility is not applicable to the image since it focuses on a map layout.",
