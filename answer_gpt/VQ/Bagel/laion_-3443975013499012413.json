      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the crystal facets on the fish's body follow the natural curves and scale patterns of the original wooden carving without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal fish's body is rendered with facets that create a geometric pattern, typical in crystal sculptures. These facets do form a scale-like pattern but are not aligned with the natural curves of the original wooden carving from Image A. The wooden fish is a continuous curved carving, while the crystal involves straight lines and angular facets, representing a more stylized and abstract version. Hence, there is a geometric distortion compared to the natural curves of the wooden version.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glossy surfaces of the crystal fish uniformly reflective and free from abrupt texture changes or matte patches that break the illusion of fluidity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the crystal fish in Image B is designed to be glossy, with light reflecting at different angles due to the faceted nature of the crystal. The reflections are uniform across the entire body with no visible abrupt texture changes or matte patches, ensuring a seamless and fluid appearance typical of well-crafted crystal sculptures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the spiral shape of the fish preserved in the crystal version, with no stretching, compression, or misalignment of segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original wooden carving in Image A features a fish in a circular, spiral-like shape. In the crystal version in Image B, the fish is upright and static without the original spiral form. The crystal sculpture is a different representation, lacking the continuous circular motion seen in the wooden design. Therefore, the spiral shape is not preserved in the crystal version.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the mirrored pedestal beneath the crystal fish reflect the sculpture accurately, with no visible distortions or missing reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mirrored pedestal in Image B provides a reflection of the crystal fish that appears to be accurate. The reflection matches the part of the sculpture that would logically be visible from this angle, showing no distortions or mismatches between the sculpture and its reflection.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details such as the gill lines, eye sockets, and fin textures clearly preserved in the crystal version without fading or smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the crystal fish with significant detailing preserved. The facets help in defining the scales, while the eye and fins are well-articulated with sharp lines and textures typical of high-quality crystal work. This preserves and highlights fine details effectively without fading or smoothing them out.",
