      "question": "Do the vertical towers now resemble tree limbs with natural bark texture and leaf coverage, without visible seams or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure has been transformed into a large tree-like figure. The vertical tower elements appear to have been replaced by wooden limbs that resemble a tree's bark. The texture and organic form suggest trunks or branches, contributing to the likeness of a natural tree without any geometric distortions or seams typically associated with man-made constructions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arches now formed into a continuous ribcage structure with natural curvature and spacing, free from broken or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the arches as part of a large, tree-like figure with a ribcage structure. The wooden elements form a continuous structure that resembles ribs with a natural flow and alignment, arranged in a way that mimics anatomical curvature typical to rib cages, without broken or misaligned segments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the suspension cables been replaced with vine-like tendrils that show natural growth patterns, such as twisting or clinging, and do they blend with the forest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements resembling suspension cables in Image A are replaced by vine-like tendrils. These tendrils appear to be naturally growing and exhibit patterns such as twists, curves, and clinging to other elements in a manner consistent with natural vines. They blend seamlessly with the surrounding forest, providing a cohesive appearance consistent with organic growth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bridgeâ€™s foundations now consist of moss-covered roots extending into the stream, with natural branching and tapering, rather than solid stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the foundation of the transformed structure, which appears to be integrated into a large tree figure. The roots extend into the stream, covered in moss and branching naturally. These roots taper into the ground, providing a realistic depiction of tree roots instead of solid stone foundations typically found in bridge structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a bark-textured head structure with two glowing emerald eyes positioned at the top of the bridge, with the glow confined and not causing light bleed or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the top of the structure resembling a tree, there is a head with bark texture, effectively transformed from the original bridge elements. The eyes are depicted as glowing emerald green, with the glow neatly confined to the eye area, not causing any light bleed or unnatural highlights. This detail adds a fantastical element to the transformation.",
