      "question": "Does the 3D character's face retain the original facial details and proportions without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face of the 3D character appears simplified in a stylized manner that is typical of chibi or 3D caricature representations. These styles usually exaggerate certain features, such as larger heads or simplified facial structures, for a cute or whimsical appearance. The chibi style uses a simplified and exaggerated form that is not meant to replicate realistic human proportions, so this retains the intended design without unnatural distortions within the style. Without analyzing the real-world face structure or exact detail-to-detail comparison with Image A, which is not the approach employed here, the character appears consistent with chibi design norms. Thus, considering the style used, there are no additional unnatural distortions present within the intended art form.",

      "question": "Are the chibi-like long-legged proportions of the 3D character visually plausible and structurally coherent, avoiding unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D character exhibits long-legged proportions typical of chibi characters, where limbs are often lengthened relative to the body. The character maintains a coherent and balanced structure typical to the chibi art style, where exaggerations are meant to enhance the charm or personality without becoming visually unsettling. There is no evidence of geometric distortions that detract from the character's appearance. The visual intent appears deliberate and consistent with stylized chibi features, ensuring the character looks purposefully constructed rather than distorted.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the outfit and accessories of the 3D character incorporate the green and burnt orange hues naturally, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outfit of the 3D character accurately reflects the green and burnt orange hues seen in Image A. These colors are applied uniformly and seamlessly over the character's attire, typical of quality 3D rendering where both color and texture are maintained. There is no visible loss of detail in the colors, and they transition well across different elements of the attire. The shades complement each other as expected, without any visual artifact indicating poor texturing or color application. The overall integration appears natural, showing consistency in texturing and coloring typical of deliberate 3D artwork.",

      "question": "Are the fashion-forward accessories like glasses, a tablet or sketchbook, and footwear integrated seamlessly into the 3D character, maintaining overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the accessories such as glasses, a tablet or sketchbook, and footwear are part of the 3D character's overall design. These elements are well integrated into the character’s outfit, with appropriate scale, placement, and style which supports the character's chibi form. The accessories fit into the context of the character, adding to its visual narrative without appearing extraneous or artificially appended. The visual coherence maintains authenticity, as the accessories do not clash with the character’s proportions or intended design style.",

      "question": "Does the solid background color complement and highlight the 3D character's overall color scheme without introducing any distracting artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the solid background color is neutral and provides a consistent backdrop that allows the character's colors — mainly the green and burnt orange hues — to stand out effectively. The choice of the background does not clash with the character’s attire and helps in bringing out the saturation of the primary colors. There are no visible artifacts or distracting elements within this background that could take attention away from the character, which supports the character visually without interference.",
