      "question": "Does the robe's fabric show natural folds and creases consistent with silk material, and are the dragon and floral embroidery patterns continuous and free from jagged edges or missing stitches?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robe in Image B appears to have a smooth texture with patterns that are intricately detailed. Silk typically has a natural sheen and slight folds due to its fluid nature, which are visible here. The embroidery of dragons and florals is continuous and appears precise, lacking any disruptive jagged edges or missing stitches. This suggests a design that resembles high-quality silk garments.",
