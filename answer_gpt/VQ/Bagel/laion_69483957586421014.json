    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the packaging box maintain correct proportions relative to the food processor, especially in alignment with the base and handle, without any distorted edges or warped geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging box shows an image of the food processor on the front. By examining the visual cues, such as the relative size and alignment of the image on the box with the actual processor, the proportions appear consistent and aligned correctly. The edges of the box aren't warped, and the processor's illustration aligns correctly with the box's dimensions, suggesting accurate depiction of proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the 'Waring' brand name clearly visible and properly aligned on the packaging without overlapping or distorting adjacent elements such as the appliance illustration or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Waring' brand name is prominently displayed on the packaging. It is distinct, clearly visible, and is correctly positioned on the box's face. It does not interfere or overlap with the adjacent illustrations or background elements, maintaining clear separation and proper alignment with other design elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the isometric illustration of the food processor on the box accurately reflect the original object's geometry, including the feed tube, lid, and base, without distortion or incorrect angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration of the food processor on the packaging box is examined by comparing it with recognizable features of such appliances, like the feed tube, lid, and base. The illustration follows the typical proportions and geometry seen in food processors. There is no noticeable distortion or incorrect angles, and the representation appears consistent with the real object's structure and form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the exploded components of the food processor depicted with accurate shapes and positions, maintaining their original form and material texture without stretching or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the exploded view of the food processor components on the packaging displays separate parts such as the lid and bowls. Visual examination reveals that these components are illustrated with clearly defined shapes and positions. The textures and forms are preserved without any noticeable stretching or blurring, maintaining the integrity and clarity of their original appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the metallic silver and matte black surfaces of the packaging display natural material finishes without unnatural reflections, graininess, or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging showcases metallic silver and matte black surfaces. The finishes appear smooth and even, without any signs of unnatural reflections, graininess, or texture artifacts. These surface finishes align with what is commonly expected from such materials, suggesting that they are rendered naturally and accurately on the packaging.",
