      "question": "Are all six dolls proportionally scaled with consistent body structure, showing no distorted limbs, oversized heads, or irregular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By observing the six dolls in Image B, each doll appears proportionally scaled and maintains a consistent body structure. There are no visible distortions in the limbs, the heads are sized appropriately for their bodies, and they do not show any irregular shapes. This suggests a uniform aesthetic approach to the design of these dolls.",

      "question": "Do all six dolls clearly display the original figureâ€™s beard, headwear, and distinctive robe patterns in a simplified but consistent manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls in Image B show features such as beards, headwear, and robe patterns, which hint at the simplified replication of the original figure's attire. The design is consistent across all dolls, maintaining recognizable elements that suggest a cohesive stylization.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dark-wood desk textured realistically with visible grain, proper shadows, and correct scale relative to the dolls, and is it fully grounded beneath them without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dark-wood desk in Image B exhibits a realistic texture with visible grain patterns. Shadows appear natural and the desk is correctly scaled in relation to the dolls. The dolls are fully grounded on the desk, showing no signs of floating or misalignment, suggesting a realistic interaction between the objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the robes on the dolls exhibit smooth, curved folds consistent with a breeze, without jagged lines, unnatural stretching, or broken textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robes on the dolls in Image B are depicted with smooth, curved folds, giving an impression of natural drape and movement, akin to being affected by a breeze. There are no jagged lines or unnatural stretching, nor are there any broken textures, indicating a well-rendered design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all dolls have hands with exactly five fingers, properly shaped and spaced, without extra digits or deformed joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the facades of the dolls don't focus heavily on the hands, based on the typical design for such dolls and visible cues, their hands are likely simplified and do not depict individual fingers in detail. However, the design does not suggest any anomalies such as extra digits or deformed joints.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows that the dolls have orange and blue colors applied consistently and uniformly. There is no noticeable color bleeding, and the tones are consistently matched throughout the set of dolls, reflecting careful application of color without unexpected gradients.",
