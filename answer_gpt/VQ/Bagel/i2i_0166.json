      "question": "Does the added poem text blend naturally with the image without causing any visible distortion to the background or bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the poem text does not appear to cause any distortion to the bird or the surrounding background. The placement of the text does not affect the focus on the bird and branch, which remain clear and undistorted. This indicates that the text was added in a manner that respects the overall integrity of the image. Comparing with Image A, which has no text, Image B retains the original clarity of the elements, demonstrating that the text addition does not alter or damage the natural elements of the image.",

      "question": "Does the poem text appear in a position that does not obscure important elements like the bird or branch, ensuring structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the poem text is placed in the lower right corner, away from the bird, the branch, and other key elements, ensuring that no important features are covered or obscured. This position is strategically chosen to maintain the structural consistency and focus on the primary subject, the yellow bird, and its perch. The comparison with Image A shows that the structure and visibility of main elements are preserved in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the font and size of the added poem text appropriate, maintaining readability while not overpowering the natural elements of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The font and size of the poem text in Image B are selected to be clear and readable, while being appropriately sized to not draw excessive attention away from the main subject, the bird. The text is legible without hindering the viewer's appreciation of the image's natural qualities. This balances the textual and visual elements without one overpowering the other. Image A, lacking text, highlights that the addition in Image B maintains readability and harmony with the scenery.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the poem text has been integrated smoothly, matching the lighting conditions present in the image, particularly the soft light on the left side. The text avoids appearing artificial or detached, suggesting it was carefully designed to complement the existing light and shadows. A comparison with Image A confirms this, as there are no new distractions or incongruences introduced by the text in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition of Image B, with the poem text, keeps the layout balanced, maintaining the natural feel of the scene. The text is positioned to complement rather than clash with the image's primary visual elements. The harmonious integration of text without disruption suggests a well-executed design. Comparing this with Image A, which is naturally balanced, Image B maintain this harmony by ensuring that the added text does not interfere with the scene's integrity.",
