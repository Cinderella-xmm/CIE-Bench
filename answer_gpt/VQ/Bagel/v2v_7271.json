      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brick textures and shapes of the building and the \"LAUNDROMAT\" sign consistent with Lego bricks, without introducing unnatural artifacts or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brick textures and shapes of the building are designed to mimic the appearance of Lego bricks. Lego bricks are usually characterized by their uniform rectangular shapes and the presence of studs on top. In this image, the building's exterior composed of rectangular elements without studs is representative of larger Lego pieces used in architectural sets. The 'LAUNDROMAT' sign also retains clear, Lego-like characteristics with blocky lettering and sharp edges, typical in Lego designs. This is consistent with products seen in Lego miniatures or Lego-themed environments.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the person holding the laundry appear naturally integrated into the Lego-style environment without any visible distortion or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is represented as a Lego minifigure, which is a common way to depict humans in Lego-themed environments. The minifigure's blocky, simplified form is consistent with the Lego aesthetic. There is no visible distortion or blending issues; the figure is well-proportioned and coherent within the context of the surrounding Lego-style elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the washing machines and interior elements inside the laundromat look like they are made of Lego bricks, preserving their structural integrity and avoiding broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the washing machines and interior elements inside the laundromat are transformed to resemble Lego constructions. They maintain a clean block-like structure with distinct contours appropriate for Lego elements. There are no broken geometric shapes, and the transformation respects the typical integrity of Lego design, preserving the functionality and detail expected in a Lego model.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stack of folded laundry held by the person retain its natural appearance and texture, without appearing as if it is made of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the stack of folded laundry is represented in a Lego form rather than a natural texture. The laundry appears simplified with uniform, block-like shapes lacking the natural fabric texture and visual complexity. This aligns with converting objects into Lego-style elements, which typically prioritizes geometric shapes over realistic textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the scene, including the person, the laundry, and the laundromat, coherent and visually plausible as a stop-motion diorama crafted in the style of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B is visually cohesive as it effectively transforms various elements (person, laundry, laundromat) into a consistent Lego aesthetic. Every object, whether it is the person holding the laundry, the folded clothes, or the building, is rendered in a manner conforming with typical Lego blocks. This creates a coherent representation as one might see in a stop-motion diorama or animation using Lego figurines and settings.",
