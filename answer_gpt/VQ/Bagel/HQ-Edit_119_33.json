      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details in the sunflower centers, hair braids, and facial features preserved and clearly defined, without noticeable blurring or artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design style focuses on stylization rather than intricate detail. The Art Nouveau aesthetic often prioritizes flowing lines and large, simple forms over fine detailing. Therefore, while clarity is maintained in design outlines, the detailed texture typical of realistic representation is not present, particularly with simplification in the stylized areas like the sunflower centers and hair. As Art Nouveau involves abstraction with bold lines, the details are enhanced through line work but not through minute texture, which differs from realistic detailing.",
