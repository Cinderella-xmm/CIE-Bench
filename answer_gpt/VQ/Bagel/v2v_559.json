      "question": "Does the 3D chibi version of the person in the foreground maintain the structural integrity of the suit and cup without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi version showcases traits such as exaggerated facial proportions typical of this art style, while maintaining realistic elements in the clothing and items they hold. The suit of the chibi character appears smooth and well-constructed, and the cup held seems proportionate and natural for the chibi style. There are no visible distortions or unrealistic textures introduced in these elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character in the background wears a suit that appears to be structurally sound and consistent with the 3D art style. The depiction of the lamp retains a warm glow that adds to the scene's ambiance, with no visible artifacts or texture issues.",

      "question": "Are the facial features and suit details of both chibi characters rendered with sufficient detail and texture to avoid looking unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters' facial features are characteristic of this stylized art form where proportions are distinctive yet familiar. The suit details, despite being simplified, do not show any unnatural textures or lack of cohesion with the rest of the image, effectively suiting the aesthetic of chibi art.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character in the foreground has hands that are adequately sized and shaped for the art style, showing no signs of distortion. The hand holding the cup is proportionate and aligns well with the commonly understood physical standards for chibi characters.",

      "question": "Does the addition of the photo frame around the chibi-style 3D scene enhance the visual credibility and realism of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the photo frame serves as a border that adds a contextual element or a sense of containment to the scene. This framing bridges the artistic representation and the viewer's perception, enhancing the composition by creating an impression similar to a diorama, complementing the chibi style rather than detracting from it.",
