    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges of the tiger’s face cleanly defined with uniform thickness and no pixelated or broken lines indicating poor rendering?",
    "explanation": "The tiger's face in Image B is represented in a paper art style. The edges are sharply cut with a clear, consistent thickness, typical of precision paper cutting. There are no pixelated or broken lines, which is characteristic of well-rendered digital or paper art. The clean lines suggest high-quality rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the exaggerated stripes and enlarged whiskers remain symmetrically aligned and proportionally consistent with the rest of the tiger’s facial structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes and whiskers on the tiger's face are design elements typical of stylized or abstract representations. The stripes and whiskers are symmetrically aligned and maintain proportional consistency with the face. There is a deliberate and balanced design symmetry in this art style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the kimono panels clearly separated into distinct layers with clean edges and no overlapping or floating segments that suggest improper layering?",
    "explanation": "The kimono in Image B shows clear and distinct layers typical of paper art, with each layer having sharp, clean edges. The absence of overlapping or floating segments demonstrates proper layering in the context of paper-based media, indicating that the design is intentional and well-executed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the gold foil elements exhibit consistent reflectivity and blend naturally with the surrounding floral pattern without harsh highlights or floating fragments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold foil elements are clearly depicted as consistent in texture and color tone, blending well with the surrounding floral pattern. The consistent reflectivity without harsh highlights or floating fragments suggests that the gold elements are integrated naturally into the overall design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the detachable panels aligned with natural fold lines or garment seams and do they appear securely attached without floating or intersecting incorrectly with adjacent clothing parts?",
    "explanation": "The panels in the kimono design of Image B are aligned to create a visually cohesive and symmetrical garment representation. The layered effect and sharp edges imply secure attachment, while there are no signs of floating or incorrect intersections. This reflects a precise alignment typically seen in paper cut art forms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
