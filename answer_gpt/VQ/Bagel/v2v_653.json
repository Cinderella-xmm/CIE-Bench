      "question": "Does the chibi version of the scientist retain the white lab coat and light blue shirt without any unnatural distortions in shape or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi version of the scientist distinctly shows the white lab coat and light blue shirt, which are consistent with the attire of a typical scientist character and resemble the conventional lab attire, reflecting typical characteristics without distortion. The simplified style of the chibi does not result in unnatural distortion or texture changes based on general chibi design principles.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scientist's beard and hair depicted naturally in the chibi style, without any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi style, details like facial features such as beard and hair are often minimized as part of the simplified artistic design. The hair on the chibi version retains a simplified yet natural depiction typical for chibi; the beard detail, likely omitted due to simplification, does not introduce unnatural textures.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the background elements, including the bright green color and hexagonal patterns, enhance the chibi scientist stickers without causing any visual disruption or introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bright green color and hexagonal pattern background are stylistic choices that align with creating a vivid and playful environment around the chibi scientist stickers. These elements are intended to complement rather than disrupt, ensuring respect to the sticker design's graphical coherence without introducing any unnatural artifacts.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observation, the scientistâ€™s hands in each pose have a simplified formation typical to chibi art style, which sometimes might not depict the exact number of fingers, yet remains consistent with artistic norms for the genre, appearing naturally shaped without visible distortions.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each pose reflects a coherent set of actions consistent with the persona of a scientist involved in various tasks. The expressions are simplified but plausible, matching the chibi style's typical exaggerated yet harmonious features without introducing distortions.",
