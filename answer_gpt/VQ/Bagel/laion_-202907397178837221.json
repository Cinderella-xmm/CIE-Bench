      "question": "Do the pixel-patterned facades on the skyscrapers align precisely with the original building outlines, showing no distorted edges or misaligned blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers are depicted as having facades with pixel-patterns and luminous designs. The design intention is to represent a digital, futuristic city skyline. However, the pattern does not utilize the typical rectangular windows and smooth lines of a standard skyscraper; instead, it is designed with a pixelated, artistic representation that is intentionally different from realistic outlines. The blocky nature might suggest misalignment or distortion to an extent, as it's meant to stylize rather than precisely replicate the traditional skyline architecture found in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the angular digital circuits forming the trees connected logically from base to tip, with no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of trees is artistic and conceptual, designed to resemble digital circuits. These circuit-like structures are intentionally angular and abstract. As an interpretation of technology and nature, the lines and connections are likely designed for visual impact rather than to follow strict conventional connectivity. Upon close inspection, they appear to maintain an internal consistency, with logical connections from base to tip, not showing any abrupt breaks or misplaced sections.",

      "question": "Do the neon lights along the bridge run continuously along the rail tracks and side panels without gaps or incorrect bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a futuristic scene with neon lights emphasizing certain lines, such as a bridge. The depiction is digital and stylized, focusing on continuity in line design for clarity and aesthetic appeal. The neon path seems to be continuous, designed intentionally to highlight particular architectural lines, suggesting a deliberate effort to avoid gaps or incorrect bends.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all skyscrapers in the skyline uniformly converted to pixel-patterned luminous towers, with no partial or missing conversions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire skyline is redrawn in a futuristic style with skyscrapers represented as pixel-patterned luminous towers. Each building is captured in this cohesive artistic rendering, where no building is depicted in its original form. This leads to a uniform conversion across the skyline, ensuring that no skyscraper remains unconverted or incomplete in this artistic iteration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the window grids on the buildings, the individual beams of the bridge, and the foliage of non-digital trees still clearly visible and undistorted after editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the original details such as window grids, bridge beams, and tree foliage from Image A are replaced or heavily stylized with pixelated, digital representations. The emphasis is on abstract, luminous designs rather than realistic details. Consequently, intricate features like window grids or natural tree foliage expected in Image A are substituted with conceptual digital imagery, and therefore, are not visible or maintained in their original form.",
