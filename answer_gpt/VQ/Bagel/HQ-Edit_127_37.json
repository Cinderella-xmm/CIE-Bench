      "question": "Does the chibi knight maintain consistent metallic texture across the armor, with no visible warping or unnatural smoothing of surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi knight features a metallic armor with a smooth, shiny surface typical of chibi-style figures which tend to have simplified textures compared to realistic depictions. The armor appears consistent without any visible warping, as the design in chibi art is often streamlined and stylized to maintain clean lines and surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass dome visually coherent, with clear edges and realistic light refraction, and does it enclose all elements without intersecting or clipping through them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome is clear and allows the interior elements to remain visible. The edges are well-defined, and the light interacting with the dome exhibits realistic reflections and refraction effects. The elements, including the knight, dragon, sheep, and turrets, are entirely encapsulated within the dome without any clipping, providing a cohesive and unified enclosure.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shield retain its embossed lion design and metallic sheen, with no visible loss of fine detail or unnatural flatness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi knight's shield features a simple, smooth design befitting the stylized nature of chibi figures, without an embossed lion motif seen in more detailed depictions. The smooth surface is consistent with the chibi aesthetic, which simplifies objects and rarely includes intricate details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sheep proportionally small compared to the knight, with natural wool texture and anatomically correct forms, and are they positioned on the ground without floating or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep are designed in a cute, simplified manner consistent with chibi style, appearing proportionally small next to the knight figure. They have a stylized wool texture, indicative of a simplified artistic approach. The sheep are positioned on the ground properly without evidence of floating or clipping through other objects, maintaining coherence in the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dragonâ€™s body form a continuous, non-intersecting curve around the turret, with consistent scaly texture and no visible gaps or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon curves smoothly around the turret with no visual intersecting or clipping issues. Although stylized, the texture shows consistency in design and does not display visible gaps or deformation. The depiction aligns with the expected continuity and stylistic consistency within the chibi aesthetic.",
