    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the orange lifebuoy still clearly visible as a circular object centered within the intended eye area, with white foamy textures extending outward like lashes without breaking the circle's outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange lifebuoy functions as the eye of a fantastical fish-like creature. It is centered in the facial region and maintains its circular shape. The surrounding textures, resembling lashes, extend outward consistently, reinforcing the intended notion of an eye. Thus, the lifebuoy is seamlessly integrated into the design without breaking the circle's integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the netting sections along the shoreline transformed into soft, undulating fin shapes with gradual transitions from mesh to organic form, lacking sharp angles or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the netting observed in Image A has been artistically modified to represent fins. These fins appear to have gentle contours and transitions from what would represent netting to a natural fin shape. This transformation is smooth and lacks any visually detectable hard or pixelated edges, capturing an organic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shoreline curve smoothly into a continuous, rounded body shape with wave-like ridges embedded in the sand, without sudden kinks or flat regions disrupting the flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the shoreline as the body of a large, smooth, fish-like creature. The transition from the sandy shoreline into a body form is rendered with smooth, flowing curves and rounded shapes without abrupt changes or flat sections that would otherwise disrupt its organic continuity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sea-green markings distributed evenly across the sandy surface with soft, diffused edges and no visible pixels, overlays, or repeating patterns that suggest artificial addition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish-like body is adorned with sea-green spots, evenly distributed across its surface. These markings have blurred edges that blend seamlessly with the body, demonstrating an absence of harsh pixels or obvious overlays that would imply digital manipulation or repetition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the eye (lifebuoy), fins (netting), and body (shoreline) align in a way that suggests a single, cohesive organism with logical proportions and no floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements in Image B, including the eye represented by the lifebuoy, the fins as extensions of the netting, and the body cast from the shoreline, are integrated effectively to form a single cohesive organism. Their proportional relationships and positioning ensure that no part appears disjointed or incorrectly placed, achieving a plausible and imaginative creature design.",
