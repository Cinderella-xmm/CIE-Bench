    "Question": "Q1: Does the dancer’s raised leg and arm maintain natural human proportions and joint alignment despite the stylized design, with no visible geometric distortion or unnatural bending?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's raised leg and arm are depicted in a stylized manner consistent with stained glass art. The proportions appear deliberately exaggerated, yet harmonious, typical for this art form. Analyzing based on visual cues and world knowledge of stained glass design, which often simplifies forms, the depiction maintains aesthetic integrity without unnatural distortion, aligning with typical human joint alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the patterns on the dancer’s dress and accessories composed of smooth, continuous lines and uniform color segments without jagged edges or fragmented areas indicating texture errors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer’s dress and accessories are composed of segments typical in stained glass art, featuring smooth and continuous lines that create distinct color patches. This method inherently avoids jagged edges as the lead frames provide clean separations between colors. The use of consistent color segments aligns with the style known for its visual clarity and uniformity, indicating there are no texture errors.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the huts and trees in the background exhibit smooth, curved forms consistent with Art Nouveau aesthetics, without distorted silhouettes or collapsed geometry?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents huts and trees in the background using fluid lines and elegant curves typical of Art Nouveau aesthetics. The stained glass style naturally utilizes flowing lines to form shapes, ensuring that silhouettes remain coherent and geometrically stable, avoiding any appearance of distortion or collapse.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the color gradient across the sky and ground consistent with a soft, iridescent glass effect, showing no harsh boundaries or artificial highlights?",
    "explanation": "The color gradient in Image B is consistent with stained glass art, where colors blend softly and evenly without harsh lines or artificial highlights. The use of textured glass creates a natural diffusion of color in this artistic interpretation, effectively mirroring a soft, iridescent effect similar to how light passes through translucent materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the hand holding the cloth display five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and does it interact realistically with the fabric without clipping or floating?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the cloth is rendered in a stylized manner typical of stained glass art, which may not emphasize realistic detailing like individual finger spacing or curvature. However, the interaction between the hand and the fabric is depicted cohesively without visual errors like clipping or floating, maintaining the stylistic continuity of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
