      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the shadows under and around the protruding clock consistent with its new 3D effect without creating artificial or inconsistent lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock has been edited to appear as if it is protruding from the wall. The shadows beneath and around the clock should be consistent with the lighting direction and intensity to create a realistic 3D effect. By observing the length and gradient of shadows, they align well with a single light source, thereby maintaining the depth perception and realism of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the circular shape of the clock remain undistorted and geometrically sound after being altered to appear as if it protrudes from the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the protruding clock maintains a consistently circular outline without any visible distortions, indicating that the transformation to a 3D effect has preserved its geometric integrity. The edges are smooth and the perspective is correctly handled, ensuring that it remains a perfect circle when viewed from this angle.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the textures and fine details on the clock face been preserved, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or pixelation as a result of making it appear 3D?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the clock face appears smooth and lacks any pixelation or artifacts that would indicate a loss of detail. The white surface of the clock retains its texture quality, even with the added 3D effect, demonstrating good preservation of original details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the clock's hands and markings retain their original clarity, style, and proportion, contributing to a natural and credible appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock hands and the lack of additional markings remain clear and proportionate to the clock face, consistent with typical minimalist clock designs. There is no blurring or distortion evident, which contributes to a credible appearance, matching the original design prior to modification.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited clock appear to naturally integrate into the wall with a realistic thickness and depth, maintaining visual plausibility within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock is shown as part of a thicker, rectangular panel mounted on the wall, giving it additional depth. The integration with this panel appears natural, with realistic thickness and seamless blending into the scene. The shadowing and perspective reinforce the depth, ensuring plausibility within the visual context.",
