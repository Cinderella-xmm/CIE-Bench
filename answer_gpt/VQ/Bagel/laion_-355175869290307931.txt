    "Question": "Q1: Are the lines forming the chevron pattern on the front panel evenly spaced, angularly consistent, and free from jagged edges or irregularities that suggest distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, no chevron pattern is present. Instead, Image B portrays a black portfolio with an open interior featuring a patterned section and a plain area that resembles paper, along with a gold-colored bookmark (letter 'C'). Since Image B lacks the chevron pattern, the question about the pattern's spacing, angularity, and distortion cannot be applied.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the gold zippers retain their linear definition and proper placement along the seams, with no misalignment or broken segments suggesting artifacting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible gold zippers. However, in Image A, the bag's olive-green exterior features gold zippers on the front pocket and the main compartment. Considering there are no gold zippers present in Image B to evaluate, misalignment or artifacting does not apply to this image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the olive tone applied uniformly across the surface of the bag, with no patchy areas, color bleeding, or inconsistent saturation that suggests digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a black portfolio, not an olive-toned bag, so there is no application of an olive tone to assess for uniformity, patchiness, color bleeding, or inconsistent saturation. These attributes belong to Image A's green bag, which is not present in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the blank message area on the back of the postcard aligned with the dimensions of the front design, with straight edges and no visible warping or layering errors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual presents an open black portfolio with an interior design that includes a grid-like pattern and white papers, rather than a postcard with a blank area and front design. No postcard alignment or warping or errors relevant to a postcard's front and back alignment can be deduced here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the black portfolio contain the postcard with proper depth and alignment, showing no clipping, shadow mismatches, or unnatural gaps between the postcard and the portfolio walls?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a black portfolio with an open interior showing a geometric pattern and some sheets akin to paper, but not a postcard and portfolio setup. Thus, any evaluation of the postcard's depth, alignment, clipping, shadow mismatches, or gaps within a portfolio does not apply here.",
    "answer": "No"
