    "Question": "Q1: Does the geisha's face retain anatomical accuracy with natural proportions and smooth contours despite the stained glass transformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the geisha's face is stylized to fit the stained glass motif, which typically involves geometric shapes. Though the proportions are accurate to a certain extent, they tend to simplify and abstract in stained glass art. Anatomical accuracy might not be the focus, with artistic interpretation guiding design choices. Given the stained glass style, anatomical accuracy would be compromised due to the medium's inherent abstraction.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the patterns on the kimono composed of distinct, sharp segments resembling leaded glass, with no blurred edges or unnatural blending between colors?",
    "explanation": "Stained glass art is characterized by distinct segments separated by lead lines, and Image B reflects this with sharp delineation between colors. The transformation into a stained glass style implies a lack of blending typically found in stained glass, as seen in the geometric and segmented patterns on the kimono.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the cherry blossoms exhibit uniform glass-like textures with clear outlines and internal color gradations typical of stained glass, without appearing mushy or pixelated?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms are illustrated with typical stained glass attributesâ€”uniform textures and defined outlines with sharp segmentation. Stained glass design style avoids pixelation due to its clear divisions and bold color contrasts facilitated by the use of individual glass pieces.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the peacock fan have a logical number of feather segments arranged symmetrically around a central spine, with no overlapping or misaligned parts?",
    "explanation": "The peacock fan in Image B is resolved with symmetrical feather segments formatted in stained glass style, which often respects symmetry and geometric alignment. As per the stained glass method, each feather segment is distinct, suggesting logical arrangement and alignment around a central axis.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the background lines smoothly curved and interconnected without abrupt breaks, gaps, or inconsistent thicknesses that suggest rendering artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B reflects the stained glass style, featuring smoothly curved and interconnected lines without noticeable breaks or inconsistencies often seen in rendering artifacts. The stained glass medium tends to favor clean lines and connections as part of its traditional assembly process.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the hand holding the fan display five clearly defined fingers with proper ergonomics and no extra digits or fused joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized nature of stained glass art may affect certain anatomical details such as finger representation. However, the hand holding the fan displays the expected number of fingers with discernible positioning, suggesting adherence to typical anatomical standards within the constraints of artistic abstraction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
