    "Question": "Q2: Are the proportions and spatial relationships of the pianoâ€™s components (lid, body, legs, pedals) preserved and correctly aligned, with no visible deformation or geometric distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions and spatial relationships of the piano's components seem accurate for a gingerbread rendering. The lid, body, legs, and pedals are aligned correctly as would be expected for a piano shape, without visible deformations or distortions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the color transition from black to caramel seamless, with soft gradients and natural light interaction that matches the lighting in the room?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a set color scheme of caramel and white; there is no transition from black to caramel. The lighting on the piano interacts naturally with the surroundings, subtly highlighting the lighting present in the image, thus maintaining color consistency.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the white marble tabletop beneath the piano flat, properly scaled, and displaying natural stone patterns and shadows that align with the light source above?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the marble tabletop appears flat and is appropriately scaled relative to the gingerbread piano. The marble shows natural stone veining patterns, with shadows that match the perceived lighting direction, creating a realistic background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all edges of the piano and its decorative elements sharp and clean, with no visible pixelation, smudging, or unnatural blending at boundaries?",
    "explanation": "The gingerbread piano in Image B exhibits clean and sharp edges, particularly around the decorative white icing. There is no pixelation or smudging, indicating precise editing resulting in smooth transitions between elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the shadows cast by the piano onto the marble table match the light direction from the chandelier and appear soft and naturally diffused?",
    "explanation": "Image B casts shadows that are not directly under a chandelier; instead, ambient lighting likely defines the soft shadows seen. These shadows are appropriately soft and diffused, consistent with the general ambient lighting of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
