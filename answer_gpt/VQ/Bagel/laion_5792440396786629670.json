    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the castle icon used for the HOMEPAGE positioned centrally and sized proportionally to fit within the original white rounded rectangle area without overlapping nearby elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The castle icon is centrally located at the top of Image B and does not seem to overlap with nearby elements. The colors and design of the castle give it a distinct center position, similar to how the 'HOMEPAGE' rectangle is centrally located in Image A. Therefore, the castle appearance matches the placement intent without interfering with adjacent elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the connection lines are transformed into winding paths that mimic smooth trails, fitting the whimsical theme of the image.

      "question": "Is the icon replacing \"PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS\" clearly visible, properly aligned within the orange rounded rectangle, and appropriately scaled so it doesn't extend beyond the border?",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The icon for 'PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS' in Image B appears as a distinct graphic within the orange rectangle. It is clearly visible, aligned within the shape, and does not extend beyond its borders, maintaining a neat appearance unlike the simple text representation in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the decorative elements (e.g., trees, creatures) placed along the winding trails in gaps between nodes and do they have smooth outlines and consistent coloring without jagged edges or noise?",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the text in the blue rounded rectangles (e.g., \"News\", \"Events\") use a consistent, bold, child-friendly font that remains fully contained within the bounds of each shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the blue rounded rectangles in Image B, the text appears to be in a playful, bold font, suitable for a child-friendly design. It is clearly contained within the bounds, similar in functionality to Image A but adapted for thematic consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes different colors and possibly varying sizes to distinguish between levels, mirroring the functional color-coding of Image A but adapting it to a more thematic style. This ensures that although the style is playful, the separation by levels remains clear.",
