    "Question": "Q1: Are the mountain shapes simplified into clear geometric forms without distorted edges or irregular facets that break their structural consistency?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain shapes are clearly depicted using sharp, geometric lines and facets. The mountains look linear and angular, emphasizing a stylized aesthetic that maintains structural consistency without distorted or irregular edges. This contrasts with more natural depictions where mountains would have more organic forms and textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the trees retain recognizable silhouettes with consistent geometric proportions and smooth outlines, avoiding fragmented or misshapen branches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are depicted through geometric shapes, with smooth, consistent outlines that ensure the trees remain recognizable as simplified artistic forms. The branches and foliage lack fragmentation or irregular shapes which maintains the visual integrity of each tree.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the radiating parallel lines in the river aligned with its natural flow direction and spaced uniformly to maintain visual continuity?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, the river is depicted with lines that are designed to emphasize flow, using symmetry and stylistic parallel lines. These lines are consistently spaced and follow the length of the river, ensuring that the depiction aligns with the notion of flowing water in a graphic representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the reflection in the river perfectly symmetrical to the elements above it, with matching shapes and positions of trees and mountains?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection in the river doesn't perfectly match the elements above it. It focuses more on stylized features with lines and shapes that suggest reflection abstractly rather than creating an exact mirror image. This is a common artistic choice with geometric and abstract art styles.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the color block boundaries crisp and clean, with no visible blurring, feathering, or pixelation at the edges of geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boundaries of the color blocks are sharp and well-defined, indicative of vector or digital art styles where colors are separated into cleanly delineated sections without signs of pixelation, blurring, or feathering. This approach is typical in creating bold, graphic designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
