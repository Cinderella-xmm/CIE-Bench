    "Question": "Q1: Do the hippo and rabbit maintain their natural proportions and structural consistency in the 3D cartoon design without any visible distortions?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a hippo and rabbit in a 3D cartoon style, where their proportions have been stylized to fit a more adorable, chibi aesthetic. This typically involves exaggerating certain features such as the eyes and overall roundness, which are not naturally proportionate to real animals. Thus, while the figures are consistent within a cartoon context, they do not maintain natural proportions as seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the gentle lighting and cozy tones in the 3D design enhance the natural appearance of the hippo and rabbit without creating any unnatural highlights or shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is soft and consistent, brushed in warm tones which enhance the cute style of the cartoon figures. There are no harsh contrasts or unrealistic shadows, which helps in maintaining a cohesive, gentle aesthetic.

    "Question": "Q3: Are the fine details of the hippo's skin texture and the rabbit's fur preserved in the 3D design without any loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The 3D cartoon design in Image B moves away from precise textural details in favor of smooth and simplified surfaces. This is characteristic of the cartoon style, meaning that fine details observed in a realistic setting, such as skin textures and fur, are intentionally omitted for a stylized look. Therefore, the textures are not preserved as found in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"

These elements are designed to fit the style of trading cards and are visual enhancements that match the fun and playful nature of the character design.
