      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) positioned on the dial such that they do not obscure the numerals or subdials, and do they blend with the metallic texture without introducing unnatural shading or edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the clock face features eyes and a mouth drawn with bold lines that replace and obscure a large portion of the dial. This introduction of facial elements alters the original numerals' appearance, causing them to blend awkwardly with the rest of the design. The visual integration of these features does not maintain the original metallic texture seen in Image A, as instead, these features are stylized cartoon details completely changing the appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the detective desk and magnifying glass proportionally sized relative to the watch, and are they rendered with consistent line weight and shading that matches the comic style without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detective desk and magnifying glass are depicted in a comic style, establishing a proportional relationship with the oversized watch on the desk. The line weight and shading seamlessly correspond to the comic aesthetic throughout the scene. The magnifying glass and desk are not geometrically distorted in relation to the watch, reflecting a coherent stylistic integration consistent with typical comic illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the background elements (cluttered office items) appear spatially coherent with the watch, showing correct layering and perspective without overlapping or clipping through the watch's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features various office elements like papers, a phone, and other clutter behind the watch. These are spatially coherent, with no visual overlaps or clipping through the watch. The layering gives depth to the comic illustration, maintaining spatial alignment and perspective consistent with the cartoon style. The combination of these elements reflects thought-out comic composition rather than realistic depiction seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tick mark sound effects uniformly shaped and cleanly rendered around the dial, without jagged edges, smudging, or inconsistent spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Exciting visual elements replace tick mark sound effects, presented as speech and character elements alongside the watch. Image B doesn’t emphasize sound tick marks around the dial, but rather speech bubbles for dialogue. These are cleanly rendered without distortion, jagged edges, or smudging, maintaining uniform artistic integrity typical in comics. This differs from Image A where precision is essential for functionality, but style is prioritized in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the stylized version retain the original texture of the black leather strap and the brushed silver finish of the case, with no visible texture warping or color inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch’s appearance differs dramatically from Image A. The black leather strap and brushed silver finish transform into a stylized cartoon with simplified shapes and flat shading. The original texture and intricate detail in Image A are not preserved here, replaced by comic rendering that emphasizes bold outlines over texture fidelity. This intentional lossy transformation favors visual storytelling over realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the hour and minute hands, subdials, and date window preserved in their original positions and proportions, without being obscured or deformed by the added facial features or other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the cartoon watch face significantly alters the placement and proportions of hour, minute hands, and numeric details. Facial features and cartoon hands disrupt original placements seen in Image A. Cartoon artistic choices override precise arrangement of subdials and date window found in the original, leading to obscured elements that fit the comedic narrative rather than practical watch design.",
