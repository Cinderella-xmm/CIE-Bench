      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the iridescent emerald and gold patterns present a coherent and smooth transition across the owl's body, which is fundamental to natural aesthetics. The designer has integrated these vibrant colors thoughtfully with the natural feather layout, avoiding blocky shapes that break the natural rhythm expected in an owl's feather arrangement. This approach ensures that the vibrant patterns enhance rather than challenge the owl's natural appearance.",
