    "Question": "Q1: Does the miniature robot model retain accurate proportions and intact geometric shapes compared to the original robot, with no visible stretching, compression, or misaligned joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature robot model appears well-proportioned in relation to its size within the display case, maintaining symmetry in its limbs and torso. The joints and features are aligned correctly without visible distortion, suggesting the model's design adheres to the geometric structures typical of humanoid robots. Its miniaturized size implies that adjustments for display purposes were managed without altering its basic appearance. Comparatively, in Image A, the robot is depicted in a large-scale environment, with its joints and proportions clear and accurate, indicative of typical design values in robotic structures. Analyzing both images reveals that Image B maintains these design principles—evident in the symmetrical and geometric layout—confirming accurate proportions.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the circular display case transparent and smooth, with natural light interaction and no jagged edges, double outlines, or artificial artifacts around its surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the display case enveloping the robot model is characterized by a smooth, clear surface, demonstrating a realistic light refraction that corresponds with transparency. The absence of visible artifacts such as jagged edges or double outlines indicates a well-rendered glass effect. The natural reflection and light interaction on its surface align with common expectations of a transparent object, showcasing a continuity of clarity and intact form without distortion. Such visual assessment highlights a meticulously crafted display case with a natural appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the tiny gears visible under transparent panels correctly aligned with the robot’s surface, uniformly detailed, and free from overlapping or floating anomalies?",
    "explanation": "The visual examination of Image B shows that the tiny gears beneath the transparent panels on the robot's surface are neatly arranged and maintain uniformity in their detailing. They appear seamlessly integrated into the robot’s design without overlapping edges or floating segments, which could disrupt the coherent placement. Such precise alignment suggests a careful and realistic incorporation of mechanical elements, maintaining spatial accuracy typically expected in well-designed robotics.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the hexagonal base geometrically precise, with uniform edges and a consistent matte-black finish, and does the model number text appear sharp and evenly glowing without haloing or distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hexagonal base beneath the robot model showcases a precise geometric shape, with straight, uniform edges characteristic of intentional polygonal design. The base's matte-black finish appears consistent, with no visible fading or texture irregularities. Additionally, the model number text is sharp and evenly illuminated, absent of any halo effect or distortion that could detract from its readability or aesthetic appeal. This level of precision and detail emphasizes a high-quality finish typical of professional displays.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the mini landscape surrounding the display include naturally scaled trees, ground textures, and distant cityscape elements that maintain spatial consistency with the size of the display case and model?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a thoughtfully crafted mini landscape encircling the robot display. The miniature trees and ground textures are proportionally scaled to match the dimensions of the enclosed scene, creating a miniature environment that is believable relative to the model’s size. However, the presence of a distant cityscape contradicts the scale of a table-top display (e.g., it suggests a faraway element within a close model), leading to a slight inconsistency in maintaining spatial proportion. Therefore, while certain elements are well-scaled, the context of the cityscape disrupts the overall spatial harmony within the confines of the display.",
    "answer": "No"
