      "question": "Is the seed packet in the gnome’s left hand proportionally sized and properly aligned with the hand, showing no signs of floating or unnatural attachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, there is no depiction of a gnome or the packet being held in a hand. The seed packet is presented as part of a product package design. Without the context of the gnome holding it, we cannot assess its proportional size or alignment relative to a hand. Therefore, the question is irrelevant to the contents of Image B which focuses on a product package design instead.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the faux soil and botanical illustrations at the base of the gnome seamlessly integrated, showing natural texture and proper alignment with the ground plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a packaging design rather than a gnome with soil beneath it. The faux soil is part of a graphic design intended to provide a contextual background for the seed-related product. Given that this is a digitally rendered design, the soil and botanical illustrations fit within their designed space. They are digitally consistent with the product aesthetic, rather than needing to seamlessly integrate in a lifelike manner. However, they are visually consistent with the whole package theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the seed bombs in both hands have a natural spherical shape with appropriate surface texture and fit securely within the gnome’s hands without distorting finger positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a gnome holding seed bombs in its hands. It presents seed bombs graphically within a packaging setup. The seed bombs depicted have a natural spherical shape with a textured surface appropriate for visual representation on the product design. Since there are no hands shown, fitting securely in hands is not applicable.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the earthy textures applied to the seed packet, seed bombs, soil, and illustrations consistent in style and free from visible artifacts such as pixelation or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures applied are consistent with an earthy, natural theme throughout the product packaging. The overall visual presentation of the seed packet, seed bombs, soil, and botanical illustrations maintains consistency. There are no visible artifacts like pixelation or unnatural shading that would detract from the seamless design intended for a digital packaging presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the edited image balanced and structured like a product package, with all elements arranged in a logical and non-cluttered manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a clear example of product packaging design. The composition includes all elements like branding, product visuals, and thematic illustrations logically arranged to represent a structured package. The design is clean, with defined spaces for each element ensuring it is non-cluttered and professionally rendered as a coherent and balanced promotional material.",
