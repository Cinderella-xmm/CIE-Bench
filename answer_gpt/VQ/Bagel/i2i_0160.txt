    "Question": "Q3: Is the placement and appearance of the new moon natural within the context of the night sky, and does it not appear out of place or overly bright compared to the stars?",
    "explanation": "The crescent moon in Image B is positioned within the upper portion of the night sky, and its brightness is suitably moderated compared to the stars around it, ensuring it does not appear overly luminous or disproportionately highlighted. Its size aligns well with common visibility of moons in night sky imagery, contributing to a natural appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
