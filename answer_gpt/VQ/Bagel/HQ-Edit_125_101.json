      "question": "Does the 3D ballerina figure inside the snow globe maintain anatomically correct proportions and joint alignment, matching the original dancer's pose without exaggerated or broken limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D ballerina figure inside the snow globe is designed to mimic a dancer's pose. From a visual analysis, the proportions appear balanced and the limbs are correctly aligned, matching a typical ballet pose. There are no visible distortions or exaggerated limb positions that would suggest broken or unrealistic anatomy. The figure's pose is consistent with ballet's graceful and precise movements, indicating attention to anatomical correctness.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the base of the snow globe display realistic bronze texture with subtle reflective highlights and clearly defined engraved French script, without pixelation or synthetic-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the snow globe appears to feature a bronze texture characterized by its warm, metallic appearance. Upon examining the texture, it shows subtle reflective highlights that contribute to a realistic metallic finish. The engraved French script on the base is sharply defined, without noticeable pixelation or synthetic patterns, contributing to the authenticity of the design.",

      "question": "Are the snowflakes inside the globe evenly dispersed and varied in shape and size, appearing to float naturally without repeating patterns or clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the snow globe, the snowflakes are dispersed in a manner that creates a natural floating effect. They vary in shape and size, showing an organic randomness without displaying repetitive patterns or clumping. This distribution enhances the realistic visual impact of gently falling snow within the globe.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the Eiffel Tower and surrounding Parisian landmarks scaled down appropriately and geometrically intact, maintaining correct perspective and structural details without warping or flattening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Eiffel Tower and adjacent landmarks are depicted within the snow globe on a smaller scale. They retain the geometric integrity of their real-world counterparts, characterized by correct perspective and precise structural detailing. No visible warping or flattening is evident, which contributes to their authentic appearance within the scaled environment of the globe.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the glass dome of the snow globe exhibit natural refraction and subtle bending of internal elements, with smooth curvature and no jagged edges or abrupt transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome of the snow globe demonstrates natural refraction, subtly bending the visual perception of the internal elements. Its curvature is smooth without any jagged edges or sudden transitions, enhancing the realism and clarity of the scene inside the globe. This smooth curvature contributes to the overall aesthetic quality and believability of the globe.",
