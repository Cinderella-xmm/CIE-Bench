    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the lace details on the blouse rendered with consistent texture and edge definition, avoiding jagged or artificial-looking patterns that break from realistic fabric behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blouse features lace details that are stylized and simplified, which is typical of a vector or cutout illustration style. The lace is represented with linear patterns that are visually consistent across the blouse but does not aim for photorealistic or intricate fabric behavior, which is not its intention. This stylization maintains a consistent edge definition relative to the illustration's style, avoiding jagged edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the enlarged violin maintain correct proportions and undistorted structural elements such as the scroll, bridge, and f-holes, without visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin is depicted as part of a stylized illustration, where proportions and structural elements like the scroll, bridge, and f-holes are simplified. This rendering does achieve a correct visual balance with its context, matching the expectation in a vector representation, maintaining appropriate proportions and avoiding undesirable distortion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fingers on both hands correctly positioned and shaped, with no extra digits or distorted joints, maintaining natural human anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fingers are stylized black shapes that convey the structure of hands holding a violin. The positioning and shaping, although simplified, adhere to normal human anatomy without showing extra digits or distortion, suitable for an illustration style that abstracts fine details while maintaining recognizability.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the overall surface texture consistent across the image, with no mismatched areas showing sudden changes in lighting, gloss, or material quality that suggest poor layer blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B adopts a stylized, uniform appearance typical of a vector illustration, where texture and material quality are deliberately consistent, eliminating the complexity and variability seen in photorealism. The simplified elements maintain cohesive lighting and material characteristics expected for this art style, avoiding sudden changes or mismatched areas.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all foreground elements (girl, violin, table, candlestick) maintain consistent depth and placement, avoiding floating or misplaced components that disrupt spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, foreground elements are cohesively integrated within the stylistic composition of the illustration. Despite the simplicity, the spatial arrangement is clear and logical, with elements portrayed in perspective appropriate for the illustration context, ensuring consistent depth and placement without visually disrupting spatial logic.",
