    {

      "question": "Are the edges of the man’s head, cap, and shoulders sharp and unaltered by the added shadowy textures or angular lines, with no visible distortion or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the editing technique involves adding artistic elements such as angular lines and shadowy textures. These additions can affect the clarity of the edges by creating a design effect. The shadowy textures and angular lines added to the image can alter the sharpness of the edges, as they are a stylistic artistic choice that gives the image an illustrative and stylized effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the title \"The Gray Mystery\" positioned outside the man’s face and cap area, and does it not partially cover or obscure any facial features or clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title 'The Gray Mystery' is placed at the top of Image B and does not intersect with the man's face or clothing. It is positioned above, where it is clear of any interference with visual elements directly associated with the man, ensuring it remains legible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the silhouettes of the cityscape and magnifying glass appear integrated into the background without intersecting or distorting the man’s head or shoulders, and do they maintain consistent depth relative to the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouettes of the cityscape and magnifying glass are part of the background artwork and do not intersect or distort the man's head or shoulders. The background has been designed to maintain a layered depth where these elements are clearly separated from the foreground, establishing a consistent artistic depth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the skin tones, facial hair, and fabric textures of the cap and shirt still visible and consistent with their original appearance, without unnatural yellowing or fading due to the sepia effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sepia effect in Image B inherently alters the original colors to create a vintage aesthetic. This often involves yellowing or fading, which means that the skin tones, fabric textures, and colors appear different from the original image (Image A). These changes indicate a consistency with the sepia style, but not with the original appearance.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the gray cap and shirt display consistent fabric texture and weave pattern, with no visible artifacts such as blurring, noise, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic rendition using a sepia effect can alter the fabric texture and weave pattern appearance. Although stylization is apparent, the texture consistency has been maintained as much as possible given the artistic transitions. There are no visible artifacts disrupting the appearance of the fabric.",
