      "question": "Does the heart balloon retain its geometric shape without any broken lines or unnatural textures in the mosaic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heart balloon is depicted with clear outlines and consistent colors, indicating a smooth geometric shape. The mosaic effect transforms the background and surrounding elements into block-like structures but does not introduce broken lines or unnatural textures on the balloon itself. Visual cues combined with world knowledge confirm the intact geometric integrity of the heart balloon.",

      "question": "Are the child's facial features and hair preserved with clear outlines and no distortion in the mosaic transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The child's facial features and hair in Image B maintain defined lines and shapes, characteristic of a mosaic style, without visible distortion. The lines outlining the hair and face are clear, suggesting an intentional mosaic artistry rather than random distortion. Combining visual information with knowledge of mosaic art, these elements are appropriately depicted.",

      "question": "Is the background transformed into a mosaic style without introducing any obvious artifacts or disrupting the blue and yellow color harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is transformed into a distinct mosaic style, effectively creating a pattern with well-arranged pieces. The colors—blue and yellow—are distributed in a manner preserving visual harmony without disruption or introduction of unintended artifacts. From the visual cues and understanding mosaic patterns, the background retains its thematic color arrangement smoothly.",

      "question": "Does the red balloon maintain its vibrant color and round shape without any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red balloon maintains a vibrant color and smooth, round shape, consistent with a pristine, simple depiction. The details are adequately preserved, and no mosaic tiles interfere with its basic appearance. Using visual analysis and knowledge of artistic transformations, the balloon appears integrated and unhindered by unnatural textures.",

      "question": "Does the child's hand retain a natural appearance with no more than five fingers and no distortion in the mosaic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand in Image B is portrayed with clear and distinct outlines; it retains a natural appearance, showing no more than five fingers. The mosaic style is applied without compromising the anatomical correctness or proportion of the hand, ensuring a realistic depiction. Combining world knowledge with visual cues from mosaic art, the hand is appropriately rendered within the chosen artistic style.",
