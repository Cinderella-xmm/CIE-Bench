    "Question": "Q1: Does the silhouette of the rider maintain correct limb proportions and joint alignment without unnatural elongation or compression?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rider is depicted as a silhouette, which simplifies the evaluation of limb proportions and joint alignment. From the silhouette, the riderâ€™s arms, legs, and overall body proportions appear normal and natural, without any noticeable elongation or compression, maintaining a realistic representation of a rider in a dynamic pose. The limbs and joints follow a natural alignment that is consistent with a rider engaged in racing posture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the sand streaks in the background smoothly blended with the motion blur and do they follow the direction of travel without sharp, unnatural breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background features abstract colorful lines and a stylized depiction of speed or motion, rather than sand streaks. Therefore, the concept of sand streaks merging with motion blur does not apply. Instead, the colorful streaks are depicted smoothly, and they follow a directional flow behind the rider, indicative of fast movement, without sharp, unnatural breaks.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the 'RaceFuel' text clearly legible and positioned without obscuring key parts of the rider or motorcycle, and does it blend cohesively with the overall design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'RaceFuel' is positioned at the bottom of the image. It is composed of bold capital letters, making it legible. It does not overlap significantly with the silhouette of the rider, ensuring clear visibility, and the presence of color gradients and stylized elements suggests an attempt to harmonize with the vibrant and dynamic theme of the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the track outline in the upper-right corner form a continuous, closed loop without self-intersections or broken segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible track outline in the upper-right corner. This suggests an abstract and stylized approach to the design which does not include the track element present in Image A, focusing more on the graphic depiction and thematic elements related to speed. Since there is no track outline to evaluate, this aspect cannot be judged based on the available elements.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the speedometer icon positioned correctly at the bottom of the image with a clear, non-deformed dial and needle pointing to maximum speed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a circular icon with a gauge motif at the bottom, suggesting a speedometer. It is prominently visible without distortion, showing a clear dial. The needle appears to point towards the maximum reading on the gauge, visually indicating high speed, and is aligned with a stylistic representation of racing dynamics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
