      "question": "Is the spherical glass dome transparent and smooth, with no visible seams, distortions, or incorrect light refractions affecting the sandcastle inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the glass dome appears to be clear and uniformly shaped with no visible seams or distortions that would detract from the view of the sandcastle inside. There is a reflection visible on the dome, indicating that it has a realistic smooth surface without incorrect refractions that would otherwise distort the view of the sandcastle within it. This assessment relies on world knowledge that a well-crafted glass dome should evenly refract light without noticeable distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the mahogany base have a natural wood texture and consistent thickness, and is it properly scaled to support the dome and sandcastle without appearing distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mahogany base in Image B exhibits a natural wood texture indicating a realistic representation of wood grain. The base appears to be of consistent thickness, as seen through its even circular shape and proportional scaling supporting the dome and sandcastle. This judgment is based on an understanding of what natural wood looks like and how a supportive base should proportionally appear.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glittering grains evenly distributed and subtle enough to mimic sand texture without obscuring fine architectural details of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grains within the dome appear to be evenly distributed around the sandcastle. They provide a subtle glimmer that mimics a sandy texture without obscuring the details of the architectural elements like arches or towers. This observation comes from knowledge of how sand should look when laid out evenly and the importance of maintaining architectural detail visibility.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the seashells around the sandcastle clearly defined, appropriately small in scale, and free from pixelation or unnatural edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seashells depicted in Image B around the sandcastle are clearly defined and properly scaled in relation to the castle, suggesting that they are tiny decorations and not overshadowing the castle structure. They are visually crisp and free from pixelation or unnatural edges, which supports the understanding that for an item to appear realistic, it should have smooth, artifact-free edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ceramic plaque with “Empire of the Shores” inscribed clearly readable, properly attached to the base, and displaying a uniform matte pearl surface without glare or texture mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceramic plaque labeled “Empire of the Shores” is crisp and readable, suggesting good contrast and clarity in the inscription. It seems to be well-attached to the base, and the plaque displays a uniform matte finish that prevents glare, consistent with what is expected of a well-crafted decorative plaque.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the matte pearl finish uniformly applied across the sandcastle and surrounding shells, with no areas showing excessive shine or reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The finish across the sandcastle and seashells in Image B appears to be consistent and uniformly applied. There is no excessive shine or reflective surfaces that would contradict the matte pearl appearance. This conclusion is drawn from world knowledge about matte finishes, which are designed to be non-reflective.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all architectural elements of the sandcastle (towers, stairs, arches) intact and geometrically consistent, with no stretching, bending, or missing sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandcastle in Image B shows intricate designs with all structural elements like towers, stairs, and arches appearing proportionate and intact. There are no visible signs of stretching, bending, or missing sections, which suggests careful modeling and design for aesthetic and geometric consistency, as expected in a meticulously executed artwork.",
