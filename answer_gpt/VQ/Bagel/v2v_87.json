      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or artifacts visible on the elephant figure within the transparent glass cube?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is located inside a transparent glass cube display next to a LEGO minifigure. The texture on the elephant appears smooth and lacks the natural, rough texture typically seen on elephant skin, which suggests a stylized or artificial representation. The outlines and features of the elephant seem consistent with a toy or model. Additionally, the LEGO minifigure implies that the whole setup is a toy display. Thus, the textures visible do seem unnatural in comparison to life-sized details expected of an actual elephant.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical rationality of the elephant and minifigure appear consistent and undistorted within the transparent glass cube?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions of the elephant relative to the LEGO minifigure are consistent with the size and scale of toy models. Typically, such models are not to scale with real-world proportions but are proportionate within the context of miniaturized models or toys. The elephant and the minifigure both seem to fit naturally within the display without noticeable distortions in their forms, maintaining the internal logic of a toy set.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the elephant's skin texture and the backpack's material been preserved without any loss or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is a miniature figure inside a display cube and lacks the fine, detailed texture expected on actual elephant skin seen in Image A. Meanwhile, the backpack isn't present in Image B as this is a toy setup featuring a LEGO minifigure. As such, there's no direct preservation of the backpack's details from Image A in Image B. There is no expectation of preserving fine details on a toy model elephant, but rather a simplified representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the color palette of the elephant and the rich red tone of the backpack blend naturally with the desert-inspired interior without any jarring contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an elephant toy and LEGO minifigure, with no backpack included. The color palette in Image B consists of the muted, realistic tones of the elephant model and bright colors of the minifigure, typical of toy displays. There is no backpack or desert theme present in the image, suggesting a contrast with the setting in Image A, which notably includes a backpack and desert scenery. The contrast is purposeful given the playful and imaginative context of the toy display.",

      "question": "Is the composition and layout of the elements within the transparent glass cube, including the elephant, minifigure, and engraved nameplate, visually credible and well-balanced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition within Image B is of a miniature showcase, where the elephant toy and LEGO minifigure are displayed side by side, with a nameplate beneath indicating the contents. The balance and spacing within the cube seem thoughtful and well-suited for a display item, maintaining a balanced and visually cohesive look. This is typical for showcase displays of collectible items, where proper arrangement enhances visual appeal.",
