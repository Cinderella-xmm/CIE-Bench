      "question": "Does the transformed hairstyle retain a consistent volumetric structure without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in the cotton candy swirls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hairstyle resembles a cotton candy swirl, characterized by its voluminous and smooth appearance. The cotton candy swirls should have a consistent round shape without any irregular or jagged edges. By analyzing the image, it is evident that the swirls maintain this consistent, smooth volume with no unnatural breaks, which is common in illustrations aiming for a cohesive and stylized aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the suit’s surface uniformly glossy without areas of over-saturation or unnatural reflection that disrupt the 3D paper doll illusion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit is depicted with a bold color scheme and smooth surface. Uniform glossiness refers to a consistent shiny appearance across the suit without any patchy highlights or areas that are too bright. The image presents the suit in a manner that maintains a consistent surface gloss, which supports the 3D paper doll illusion frequently used in illustrations and animations.",

      "question": "Is the oversized tie proportionally aligned with the collar and neck area without distorting the jawline or shirt collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tie is visibly oversized, but it appears to be intentionally designed for a stylistic effect. The illustration ensures that the tie fits nicely under the collar and does not cause any distortion to the outline of the shirt collar or the depicted jawline area, which is crucial in maintaining the integrity of character design in artworks.",

      "question": "Are the pastel pink and blue hues smoothly blended throughout the hair without visible color banding or hard edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hair in Image B consists of pastel pink and blue hues. Smooth blending indicates a gradual transition between the colors without sharp lines or banding, which is important for an aesthetically pleasing look in art. The pastel colors in the image appear to transition smoothly without harsh edges, showcasing a seamless blending typical of professional illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the geometric patterns on the suit align with the garment’s seams and contours without overlapping or breaking at critical structural points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a suit with likely geometric patterns, and alignment with the garment’s seams and contours is essential for a coherent design. However, upon observation, there are no visible geometric patterns in the suit's design that need to be evaluated for alignment in the structural flow. If any alignment issue existed, it would disrupt the visual appeal typically expected in tailored clothing aesthetic.",
