      "question": "Are the leadwork outlines along the spiral vortex continuous, following the curve without gaps, overlaps, or abrupt breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leadwork outlines are designed to mimic a stained glass effect, creating a pattern with black lines outlining each color segment. Observing these outlines, they follow the spiral's curvature consistently without visible breaks or overlaps, maintaining uninterrupted flow which is typical in quality stained glass art. This suggests the outlines are indeed continuous along the spiral vortex.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the jewel-toned colors applied to the sky and tree canopies transition smoothly without visible color banding or unnatural patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stained glass representation with jewel-toned colors such as blue, red, and green, particularly noticeable in the sky and tree canopy areas. The hallmark of stained glass artistry is the smooth transition between colors due to the translucent nature and variance in glass textures, and Image B does reflect this, albeit with intentional segmentations due to the leadwork that are typical in this medium, not considered unnatural. Therefore, the color transitions are smooth within the constraints of stained glass design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the faceted glass textures applied uniformly across the spiral and trees, showing clear refraction effects without blurring or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faceted glass textures are apparent throughout, characterized by angular, segmented areas typical of stained glass. The visual effect generally maintains clarity with distinct refractions and reflections among the segments. This texture is expected to enhance detail rather than blur it in stained glass, serving to highlight elements like the spiral and trees distinctly without losing sharpness, indicating uniform application of the glass texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the leadwork lines form clean, unbroken borders around the spiral, trees, and horizon without intersecting incorrectly or creating floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained glass effect implies the use of leadwork lines to divide different colored glass segments. Observing these lines, they form comprehensive borders around key features such as the spiral, trees, and horizon. The leadwork lines are integral to the design and do not intersect incorrectly or leave parts floating, maintaining a coherent and intentional pattern typical of stained glass craftsmanship.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the individual stars within the spiral and the reflections on the water surface still distinguishable and not obscured by the glass texture or color saturation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation into stained glass affects all details, including minor ones like stars and water reflections. Due to the design nature, these elements are usually simplified or abstracted. In this depiction, while the stained glass style is prominent, the intricate elements like stars and water reflections are adjusted accordingly but can be somewhat distinguishable within the spiral segments and lighter areas, suggesting they aren't entirely obscured despite the inherent design transformation.",
