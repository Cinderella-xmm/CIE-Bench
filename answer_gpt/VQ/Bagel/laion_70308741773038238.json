      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the elongated body retain smooth, continuous curvature along the side and rear panels without sharp edges or unnatural bulges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car's elongated body is enhanced with artistic wave patterns. The overlay of these patterns does not introduce any sharp edges or unnatural bulges, maintaining a smooth and continuous curved surface. The body design exhibits a seamless flow consistent with luxury car design standards.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glass bases at the wheel positions transparent with visible internal texture, evenly shaped, and grounded flush with the platform without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no visual cues indicating the presence of glass bases at the wheel positions. The wheels appear standard, with no transparent or decorative bases. Hence, no issues regarding floating or clipping can be assessed here.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the silver cap centered on the roof area, with clean edges and reflective surface that matches the surrounding chrome elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof area of the car does not display a distinct silver cap. The vehicle's design and the wave artwork do not feature such an element, making it impossible to judge its placement, edges, or reflective quality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the embossed text along the side panel clearly legible, aligned with the body's curvature, and rendered with subtle depth and shadow to match the material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit any embossed text along the side panel of the car. The side is dominated by the wave pattern artwork, without any textual elements. Therefore, evaluating the legibility, alignment, and rendering of such text is not applicable.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wave patterns flow continuously across the surface without repeating tiles, jagged edges, or mismatched lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wave patterns are artistically rendered over the car's surface. The patterns appear to flow continuously without visible tiles or interruptions. There are no jagged edges or mismatched lighting effects, suggesting a sophisticated application that respects the curves and reflections typical of a luxurious design.",
