      "question": "Are the added gears and copper accents seamlessly integrated into the silver surface of the teapot without visible texture inconsistencies or material discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot takes on a mechanical appearance reminiscent of a steampunk style, with gears and copper accents. The integration of these mechanical elements looks deliberate and cohesive within the design. The visual continuity suggests that there are no obvious texture inconsistencies or material discontinuities, although it departs from the pure silver aesthetic of Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the curved glass dome appear transparent and smoothly contoured without geometric distortions or artificial edges that break the illusion of a real glass enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome envelops the elephant teapot, and it is rendered with a smooth contour. The transparency and lack of artificial edges or geometric distortions maintain the impression of a realistic glass dome. This suggests that the design and rendering are sophisticated enough to uphold the illusion of real glass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wooden floorboards and scattered tea leaves rendered with realistic textures and proportions, and do the tiny silver utensils appear appropriately scaled and detailed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden floorboards in Image B exhibit a texture that simulates wood grain, lending to a sense of realism. The scattered tea leaves are visible and proportionate to their setting. Meanwhile, the tiny silver utensils are modeled with apparent scaling and detail, consistent with miniature silverware, complementing the teapot display. These renderings do not appear mismatched or disproportionately scaled.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the moss accents naturally distributed along the base edge, with soft, organic texture and no signs of unnatural clustering or color mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moss accents around the base edge appear to be naturally distributed. The texture looks organic, suggesting a soft and natural appearance. There are no signs of unnatural clustering or discrepancies in color, which implies careful attention to detail in maintaining a realistic and harmonious design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the steam effect emerging from the elephant's trunk appear as a smooth, translucent vapor with natural diffusion and no jagged edges or artificial glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam effect in Image B is depicted as a gentle, translucent vapor that diffuses naturally into the surrounding air. The smooth transition and lack of jagged edges or artificial glow suggest a realistic rendering of steam, contributing to the overall believability of the steaming teapot scenario.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the vine-like metalwork elements consistently shaped and positioned around the dome, following natural curvatures without intersecting the glass unnaturally or creating inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vine-like elements in Image B are seen to wrap around the dome with a consistent and natural curvature. There are no indications of these elements intersecting with the glass in an impractical manner or generating shadows that conflict with the light source. This coherence in design supports the visual unity and realistic appearance of the composition.",
