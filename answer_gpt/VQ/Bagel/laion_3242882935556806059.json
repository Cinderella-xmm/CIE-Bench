    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the petal shapes preserved with jagged crystal facets that follow the natural curvature of the original lily petals, without visible warping or geometric breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petals are designed to imitate the structure of a lily flower but are represented as crystal sculptures. These crystal petals maintain a certain jagged facet that mirrors the smooth and natural curvature of a real lily petal from Image A. There is no evidence of warping or geometric breaks in Image B, as the petals fit together seamlessly in the overall composition and reflect the intended natural form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glass rods extend naturally from the vase upward, matching the number and spacing of the original stems, without appearing disconnected or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass rods appear to extend naturally from the vase fully and are evenly distributed, resembling the typical arrangement of flower stems in Image A. The rods are aligned and seem proportionate, displaying no visible disconnection or misalignment, which signifies a well-executed transition from real stems to artistic glass rods.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black marble surface beneath the vase smooth, uniformly dark, and reflective, with shadows and highlights consistent with the light source and object placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marble surface in Image B is observed to be uniformly dark, smooth, and reflective. The areas where the light source hits and the shadows cast by the vase are consistent with the placement of objects and the direction of light, creating a cohesive and realistic representation of an actual reflective marble surface. Such features ensure that the reflections and lighting in Image B are realistic and harmonize with the overall setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the crystal petals exhibit subtle variations in amber hue and transparency, with internal light refractions and depth cues that suggest volume and translucency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal petals display variations in amber hue and transparency, enhanced by the highlights and shadows resulting from the internal light refractions. These facets create an impression of volume and translucency, capturing light similar to how a crystal or glass structure would naturally behave, producing a realistic aesthetic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glass rods enter the water at angles consistent with refraction, showing slight bending at the waterline, and remain submerged without floating or disappearing mid-length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass rods appear to enter the water at logical angles that respect the concepts of refraction. There is a slight bending observed at the waterline which is consistent with the behavior of light through water and glass. Additionally, the rods remain visibly submerged and do not exhibit any unrealistic floating or disappearance above the water level, maintaining an accurate depiction of refraction.",
