      "question": "Do the archways in the tower appear as articulated limbs with natural joint-like transitions, preserving their original arch shape and avoiding unnatural bends or breaks in geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the archways that were part of the tower in Image A are transformed into articulated limbs of a golem. The golem's limbs maintain a similar arch shape, suggesting continuity in form, but they have been edited to resemble limbs with joint-like transitions. While this transformation gives them a limb-like appearance, it does not preserve their original form as static architectural elements. Therefore, the geometry of the limbs includes unnatural bends or breaks as part of their newly articulated design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glowing glyphs evenly distributed across the stone surface, matching the texture of the original masonry and lacking jagged edges, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the golem are adorned with glowing glyphs. These appear to be added elements and do not match the texture of the original masonry seen in Image A. The glowing glyphs have designated sharp edges, suggesting digital editing, and they stand out against the stone texture, indicating that they are not integrated into the masonry. The glyphs display abrupt color shifts, which could visually indicate they are artificial elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition from dark shadowed areas to the mystical aura around the structure gradual and continuous, without sharp discontinuities or floating light effects that lack grounding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mystical aura surrounding the edited structure is apparent where additional digital effects are introduced. This includes glowing aspects and changed lighting effects around the golem's structure. While there is a consistent transition from shadow to these effects, the added glow and light elements have visible sharp discontinuities, and some floating light effects that appear digital rather than naturally integrated.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the luminous guide wisp occupy the same position as the original figure and dog, maintaining proportional scale and spatial alignment, while exhibiting a translucent, wispy texture without solid edges or anatomical features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation of the original figure to a luminous guide wisp retains the spatial positioning consistent with Image A. However, the figure in Image B exhibits a more solid appearance rather than being a translucent wisp. The outline is defined, which detracts from the translucent and wispy expectation, and maintains proportions properly but does not have a wispy texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the foreground, midground, and background elements still perceptually layered with correct depth relationships, so that the golem appears to stand within the space rather than floating above or behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the editing, the golem appears to stand within the space of the architectural setting, maintaining the depth relationships. The foreground with the figure, midground with the structure including the golem, and background walls show perceptual layering, where the golem aligns in scale and placement within the scene, avoiding any appearance of floating above or being detached from the spatial setting.",
