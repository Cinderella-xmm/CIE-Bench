      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the kite maintain its geometric shape without any distortion or damage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite maintains a clear geometric shape, consisting of defined angles and straight lines typical of kites. This consistency in shape indicates an undistorted and undamaged geometric structure. The visual cues show a well-defined diamond kite shape, hinting at stable construction.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures on the kite that do not align with the expected paper material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The kite in Image B has a smooth surface that visually aligns with the expected appearance of a paper or light fabric material. There are no visible textures that would suggest an unnatural or unrealistic material composition. The surface appears consistent with common kite textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the yellow color of the kite consistent and natural against the sky backdrop, without any unnatural color variance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow color of the kite is bright and uniform, matching well with the clear sky backdrop. The kite's color does not show any unnatural variance or digital noise, maintaining a consistent natural hue under typical outdoor lighting conditions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the kite's tail appear structurally coherent and smoothly connected to the kite body, without any visible breaks or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail of the kite in Image B is represented gracefully, appearing to flow naturally from the kite's body. There are no breaks, tears, or abrupt changes that typically signify structural inconsistencies. The smooth connection points demonstrate a coherent and consistent design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the kite string depicted naturally, free from any artifacts or unrealistic thickness variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite string in Image B is depicted as thin, aligned with realistic expectations of a typical kite string. It doesn't exhibit unusual thickness variations or digital artifacts. The natural depiction suggests normal functionality without interference.",
