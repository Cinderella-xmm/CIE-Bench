    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the fortress walls and towers exhibit a uniform golden-brown cookie dough texture with darker edges that match the lighting direction and do not show unnatural pixelation or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress appears to be made of a cookie-like material. The walls and towers have a consistent golden-brown color typical of baked cookies. There are darker edges that enhance the perception of depth and correspond to the lighting source, giving a natural appearance. The texture appears smooth and appropriate for a cookie representation, without visible pixelation or inconsistencies in shading, indicating a clean and realistic rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls rendered as smooth, continuous streams of royal icing that follow the natural contour of the cliff and show appropriate sheen and thickness without appearing clumped or broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfalls are designed to resemble royal icing. The streams appear smooth and continuous, cascading naturally down the cliff created by the cookie structure. The icing has a sheen that reflects light, maintaining a realistic thickness expected of royal icing without displaying any clumping or breaking, which suggests high-quality rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the trees formed from green marzipan positioned naturally on the terrain, maintaining plausible size and shape without appearing compressed, misshapen, or disconnected from the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features trees that resemble green marzipan, placed strategically around the cookie fortress. These trees are proportionate and shaped similarly to confectionery models, with recognizably natural cone-like forms. They are well-positioned in relation to the cookie terrain, showing no signs of being compressed, misshapen, or disconnected. The impression is of a cohesive and realistic composition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white ceramic platter clearly visible beneath the cookie fortress, extending outward with clean edges and casting a soft shadow that aligns with the light source, without appearing to float or distort the surrounding terrain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookie castle is set on a white ceramic platter. The platter is clearly visible, extending beyond the base of the castle with distinct and clean edges. The light source casts a shadow that appears soft and matches the expected pattern based on the direction of light. The platter maintains its position without any signs of floating, and there are no distortions in the surrounding terrain.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, texture discontinuities, or abrupt transitions between the cookie dough fortress, royal icing waterfalls, and marzipan trees that suggest poor blending or rendering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the cookie dough fortress, royal icing waterfalls, and marzipan trees is seamless. Each element appears cohesive with respect to the others, without any visible seams or texture discontinuities. The blending is done smoothly, and no abrupt transitions are noted, indicating proficient rendering and composition quality.",
