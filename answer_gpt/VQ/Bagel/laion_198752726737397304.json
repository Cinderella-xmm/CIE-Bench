      "question": "Do the superhero costumes on all five individuals have consistent fabric textures and realistic draping that follow the contours of their bodies without unnatural stretching or folding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the superhero costumes are depicted in a cartoon style with bright colors, simplified details, and exaggerated features, such as oversized belts and boots. The textures are flat and uniform, characteristic of illustrations rather than real fabric, which lacks depth and realistic draping. The contours of the bodies are not followed in a natural way, with the costumes appearing as part of a stylized art form. Comparing with Image A, where real fabric textures would be expected, the edited image intentionally stylizes the clothing to fit a comic book theme, focusing on uniformity and bold outlines rather than realistic fabric representation.",

      "question": "Are the hands holding the Daffodil Power Passes positioned naturally with five fingers visible per hand, appropriate grip pressure, and no signs of clipping or floating objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands holding the 'Daffodil Power Passes' are part of a cartoonish illustration. The fingers are simplified, and the grip appears more symbolic than realistic, with hands having fewer details. There may be missing fingers or their position may not accurately depict realistic gripping. Comparing with Image A, which shows real hands and natural grip, the edited image's cartoon style causes fingers to lack clarity and realistic positioning, leading to a less natural pose.",

      "question": "Are the poses of the five individuals physically plausible, with joints aligned naturally and no bent limbs or disproportionate body segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the poses are exaggerated in a comic style, with body proportions and poses influenced by the stylistic choices typical in cartoons. Joints and limbs are often simplified, lacking anatomical correctness with exaggerated proportions. Compared to Image A, where individuals are positioned naturally, Image B deliberately alters the physicality to match a thematic, hero-like pose which doesn't adhere strictly to natural body mechanics, hence not physically plausible by real-world standards.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dialogue bubbles positioned above or near the heads of the individuals without overlapping eyes or mouths, and do they display legible text with clean edges and no visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dialogue bubbles are positioned near the heads of the characters. The placement manages to avoid overlapping eyes and mouths, which is a common practice in comic illustrations. The text is legible and the edges of the speech bubbles are clear, fitting neatly into the illustrative style. Such features are designed to maintain readability and visual clarity within the context of comic art. The absence of any overlapping with crucial facial features ensures effective communication without visual obstructions.",

      "question": "Is the enhanced garden background visually coherent with the original scene, featuring consistent lighting, natural flower arrangements, and no abrupt color shifts or artificial-looking textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the garden background is transformed into a simplified, colorful, cartoonish style that matches the rest of the edited imageâ€™s theme. While the general layout and elements like flowers and stones are maintained, the texture and shading are consistent with stylized art. Lighting and color are more exaggerated and less natural compared to Image A's realistic depictions, creating a coherent and artistically consistent look within the comic design but sacrificing naturalism in the process.",
