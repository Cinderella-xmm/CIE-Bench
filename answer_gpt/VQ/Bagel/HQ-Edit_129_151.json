      "question": "Does the elderâ€™s face show natural skin texture, realistic wrinkles, and facial proportions without distortion or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred part of the face is not assessed, so there is no applicable information to provide an analysis for this question due to the instructions given.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree trunks and branches in the background structurally coherent, with natural bark texture and no broken or warped shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree trunks and branches are depicted in a stylized, illustration-like manner rather than photorealistic, which naturally leads to less detailed texture. The trees have a coherent structure, and there are no visible broken or warped shapes. This is based on the visual style typical of illustrated art, which simplifies textures and shapes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the water surface reflect the surrounding trees and sky accurately, with smooth gradients and no distorted or duplicated elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface is illustrated and lacks the photorealistic details of reflections found in Image A. Given the style, it does not attempt to capture realistic reflections or smooth gradients as one might expect in a photographic image, so there are no distortions or duplications typical of illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the duck-shaped chess pieces positioned correctly on the chessboard squares without overlapping, floating, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the duck-shaped pieces are positioned on the chessboard in alignment with the squares without any appearing to be floating or misaligned. The illustration style maintains the intended positions with clear depiction of the pieces on the board, which is typical in structured illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the calligraphy text placed in the lower right corner without overlapping key elements, and does it have clean lines and natural ink-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calligraphy is placed in the lower right corner and does not overlap any key elements of the illustration. The text has clean lines and an ink-like texture that is typical of traditional calligraphy style, presenting a coherent and aesthetically pleasing element to the illustration.",
