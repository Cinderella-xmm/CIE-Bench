      "question": "Are the proportions of both characters consistent and free from distortion in their respective views within the combined illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the characters can be assessed by looking at the relative sizes of their body parts like arms, legs, and torsos. The characters maintain a realistic human proportion, where their body sizes appear natural and symmetrical across the different panels. This is consistent with typical illustrations showing office scenes where the characters’ body sizes do not look exaggerated or distorted. Therefore, there is no apparent distortion in proportions among the characters.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the textures of the office elements such as chairs, plants, and desks appear natural and retain fine details without obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture and appearance of the office elements such as chairs, desks, and plants can be observed. The materials of the chairs appear smooth and uniform, likely made from common office chair materials such as leather or fabric. The plants retain a natural look with simple leaf shapes and colors that are consistent with typical indoor plants. The desks appear sturdy and uniformly colored, suggesting wooden or laminated office desks. There are no visible artifacts, distortions, or unusual textures, contributing to a cohesive scene.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the computer screens realistic with sharp images, and does the interaction between the characters and screens appear natural without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the computer screens and their interaction can be analyzed by observing the characters looking directly at the screens or appearing to operate them realistically. The screens display digital content sharply, which reflects common computer graphics. The interaction between the characters and computers, where characters are seated comfortably looking at screens, is portrayed naturally without visible inconsistencies or artifacts in the way they are positioned or how the screens appear.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the characters align correctly with their environment, maintaining a plausible spatial relationship and avoiding any broken geometric shapes or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial relationship between the characters and their environment including desks, chairs, and background objects is examined. The characters are seated in an orderly fashion, interacting with their desks and screens in a natural pose. No broken geometric shapes or misaligned elements are present, indicating that the spatial composition is kept intact, and the environment aligns well with the objects and characters.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting, including the hanging lamp’s shadow and the light on the characters, maintain consistency and contribute to the natural appearance of the scene without unnatural contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting can be assessed by observing the shadow effects from the hanging lamps and its consistency across different panels. The shadows are cast in a visually consistent manner, where both characters and objects receive a uniform illumination. The overall light distribution does not present any stark or unnatural contrasts, contributing to a natural office atmosphere.",
