    "Question": "Q1: Do the wing areas of the swan exhibit a consistent frosted glass texture that matches the lighting and translucency of the original ice material without visible seams or unnatural surface distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wing areas of the swan on the bottle are designed with a glass texture. Observing the surface closely, it should exhibit a smooth and consistent texture that harmonizes with the lighting and translucency expected from frosted glass. There should be no visible seams or surface distortions that appear unnatural, ensuring that the material looks cohesive and well-integrated. Image A shows a frosted ice sculpture with natural lighting and texture, which helps in setting the expectation. Comparing this with Image B, the glass on the bottle seamlessly reflects a similar aesthetic of glass, justifying a high-quality transformation if no inconsistencies are present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the neck of the swan transformed into a glass stopper with a smooth, tapered shape that maintains proportional alignment with the body and does not exhibit unnatural bending, jagged edges, or volume inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the neck of the swan has been transformed into a glass stopper. A smooth, tapered shape should be observed here, ensuring that it aligns proportionately with the rest of the body. The design of the stopper should maintain a natural contour without any signs of unnatural bending or jagged edges, as these would suggest poor editing or design. In comparing with the original image (Image A) where the swan’s neck is naturally fluid and elegant, the transformation should ideally mirror this. The absence of volume inconsistencies further reinforces the design's quality and proportionality.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the red, pink, and green decorative elements (such as pine branches and flowers) integrated into the base of the bottle in a way that avoids floating or disconnected positioning, and do they maintain natural color and texture without blurring or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative elements are incorporated into the design of the bottle. These elements should be positioned realistically, appearing as though they are part of the base without floating or appearing disconnected. Additionally, the colors should appear natural and vibrant, with the materials having a texture that is believable and clear, free of blurring or pixelation. The comparison with Image A, where natural decorative elements rest on the snow, helps identify the expectation for realistic integration and visibility without digital flaws.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the 'Winter Glow' text clearly visible, properly aligned with the bottle's curvature, and does the iridescent effect appear smooth and continuous without unnatural color fringes or digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Winter Glow' text needs to be positioned on the bottle such that it is clearly visible and aligns with the bottle's contours. The text should follow the bottle's curvature smoothly, avoiding any misalignment that might break immersion. Additionally, the iridescent effect on the text should transition smoothly across colors, without any abrupt shifts or fringes which would suggest artifacting. Considering the overall design and the presence of such effects, careful attention must ensure continuity and adherence to a seamless digital presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the overall shape of the transformed swan-bottle maintain structural coherence, with all parts proportionally aligned and without visible warping, stretching, or disjointed sections that break the continuity of the form?",
    "explanation": "In assessing Image B, the swan-bottle needs to possess a coherent structure. The swan's features, as translated into the bottle's design, must display proportional consistency across all parts—neck, body, wings—ensuring there are no sections that look warped or stretched. The transformation should seamlessly integrate the swan's form into the bottle, avoiding any disjointed sections. Consideration of structural coherence from Image A helps set the expectation that these transformations retain the elegance and proportionality typical of the original swan figure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
