      "question": "Does the frosted crystal frame preserve the original carved details (such as the floral crest and side columns) without warping or flattening the shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame is crafted from clear crystal glass. It has a symmetric and geometric style without any carved floral details or side columns. Crystal typically doesn’t exhibit intricate carvings in the same style or detail as wood might. Therefore, the crystal frame does not preserve the carved details seen in a wooden clock, and lacks these specific elements, which contrast with the ornate wood carvings of the original wooden clock in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Roman numerals etched into the crystal face evenly spaced, legible, and aligned with the original hour positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Roman numerals are etched clearly into the crystal face and appear evenly spaced and align with standard clock positions. Roman numerals follow a pattern where each numeral denotes a specific hour, and this is consistent with how clocks generally appear, suggesting their alignment. When comparing to Image A, both images use Roman numerals, assuming a standard clock position for these numbers.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the faceted crystal pendulum symmetrically shaped, properly suspended by the chains, and free from floating or misaligned connections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pendant in Image B is symmetrically shaped, resembling a multifaceted crystal, suspended by a chain. The suspension appears appropriate as the chain leads directly to the center, conforming to the aligned plating associated with pendulums. In comparison, Image A has a traditional pendulum structure, but the concept of symmetry and proper suspension through a single chain is coherent in both images.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white marble wall uniformly textured, free from visible stitching or artificial boundaries, and does it cast soft, natural shadows beneath the clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a marble wall as the background with uniform texture, smooth and clean without visible stitching or artificial boundaries. Marble surfaces typically exhibit continuous patterns and the shadows beneath the clock show soft contours, suggesting natural light interaction, as expected from a marble surface. When comparing to Image A’s background, Image B doesn't show indicators of digital stitching or discontinuity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crystal components (frame, face, pendulum) visually integrated without noticeable gaps, material inconsistencies, or unnatural reflections at their junctions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the transition between the crystal frame, face, and pendulum appear seamless with no visible gaps or discontinuity. Crystal material generally offers consistent optical properties and smooth transitions at the junctions without posing unnatural reflections, indicating material consistency. By visual comparison with Image A, where wood naturally presents more complexity in texture, Image B's crystal components appear visually integrated.",
