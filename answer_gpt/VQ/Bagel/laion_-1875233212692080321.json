        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the gold rose-shaped cap exhibit realistic reflections and specular highlights that match the light source direction and do not appear overly shiny or uniformly colored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold rose-shaped cap displays realistic reflections and highlights that follow the expected patterns given the light source direction. The color variation adds to the realism, preventing an overly shiny or uniform appearance.",
