    "Question": "Q1: Are the cogwheel curls integrated into the hairline without distorting the shape of the head or breaking the continuity of the scalp surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cogwheel curls appear to be intricately assembled within the existing hairline, maintaining the overall contour of the head. This suggests that the design respects the natural shape of the scalp and head, indicating that the integration is seamless and does not disrupt the continuity of the scalp surface. Such integration is in line with maintaining the aesthetic and structural integrity of the bust.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the metallic fabric folds follow the natural contours of the shoulders and chest without unnatural stretching or buckling, and are the rivets and tubes placed in physically plausible locations?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the metallic fabric folds conform naturally to the contours of the shoulders and chest, suggesting careful attention to the anatomical features of the bust. The placement of rivets and tubes seems consistent with areas where structural or mechanical support would logically be added, ensuring that the modifications are both aesthetically pleasing and physically plausible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the watch parts and gears attached to the base in a stable and symmetrical arrangement without overlapping or floating elements that violate physical logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the watch parts and gears are arranged in a stable and balanced manner. There is no visible overlap or floating elements that would defy physical logic, which suggests a deliberate and symmetrical design approach. The base appears to provide solid support for these elements, reinforcing the idea of stability in the arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the monocle mechanism positioned flush with the eye socket and connected to the face via visible but plausible mechanical joints, without altering the shape of the surrounding facial bones?",
    "explanation": "The monocle mechanism in Image B is aligned with the eye socket area and appears to be anchored with plausible mechanical joints. This careful positioning suggests a mindful augmentation strategy that does not disturb the symmetrical and structural attributes associated with facial bones, maintaining the integrity of the faceâ€™s natural contours.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the bronze and copper tones uniformly applied across all modified elements, with realistic reflections and no abrupt color boundaries or flat, non-metallic areas?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, it is evident that the bronze and copper tones are applied uniformly, presenting a consistent metallic sheen. This coherence in coloration extends across all modified elements, avoiding abrupt transitions or unexpected non-metallic areas. This uniform application contributes to the visual realism of the bronze and copper elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
