    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the transformed peaks retain their original height and angularity without appearing stretched, bent, or misaligned compared to the base of the mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the peaks have been transformed into a fantastical creature resembling a giant beast covered in moss and hair-like structures, which does not naturally align with the original mountain shape. This anthropomorphic alteration introduces elements that do not follow the original angularity and height of typical peaks, resulting in a misalignment with natural mountain formations. Image A has a clear mountain structure with sharp and angular peaks. Comparing this to the fantastical transformation in Image B, the peaks no longer retain their original mountainous height and angularity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textured hide patterns on the mountain slopes smooth and consistent with natural rock formations, without repeating tile-like patterns or sharp edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textured hide patterns resemble a creature's skin or fur, with specific details like muscle definition and strands of hair, which differ greatly from natural rocky textures. These elements introduce unnatural textures that aren't smooth or consistent with the rock formations in Image A. The lack of continuity with natural rock, combined with the creature-like features, indicates deviations from natural slope textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the mossy patches and root-like strands extend naturally from existing vegetation zones and follow downhill gradients without floating above the ground or forming unnatural clusters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a creature covered in moss and root-like strands rather than a typical landscape. These features extend from the creature's body in a manner inconsistent with natural vegetation zones. The strands and moss are part of the creature itself, not rooted in the ground like vegetation. Thus, they don't naturally follow the earth's contours or gravity, as would be expected in natural growth, unlike the vegetation in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the sinewy musculature in the valley area follow the natural curve of the depression and connect smoothly to adjacent slopes without creating disjointed or exaggerated protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sinewy musculature in Image B is part of the creature's body, which doesn't align naturally with the terrain's depressions and slopes as in a landscape. This integration of musculature and terrain results in exaggerated features that lack the smooth transitions seen in a natural valley in Image A, leading to disjointed protrusions that do not connect naturally to the land around them.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the transformed elements (hide, fur, musculature) within the same tonal range as the original landscape, with no sudden shifts in hue or brightness that disrupt visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B are much more vibrant and varied, including mossy greens and browns that wouldn't typically be found in the natural landscape colors evident in Image A. These tonal differences, where the creature's skin and fur introduce hues not naturally present, disrupt the visual coherence and do not blend with the subdued colors of the original landscape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are small-scale details like erosion lines, grass tufts, and rock crevices still visible and correctly aligned with the terrain, without blurring, duplication, or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transitions from a landscape to a fantastical creature, losing the small-scale natural details found in Image A, such as grass tufts and rock erosion lines. These details are replaced with the creature's surface features, which do not align with typical terrain elements and exhibit artificial characteristics inconsistent with landscape texturing.",
