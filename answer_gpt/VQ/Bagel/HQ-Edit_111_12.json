      "question": "Are the enlarged knitting needles proportionally consistent with the size of the woman's hands and aligned naturally with her fingers without bending or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knitting needles appear oversized relative to the woman's hands, suggesting a lack of proportionality. However, their alignment with the fingers appears consistent with natural knitting posture, implying no unnatural bending or stretching is visible. Using knowledge of typical knitting activities, the alignment seems plausible, but the issue is with proportionality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the steam lines above the teacup rise smoothly from the rim in a continuous, curved pattern without sharp breaks or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steam lines appear to curve naturally upward from the rim of the teacup. There are no noticeable sharp breaks or awkward angles, which would indicate a smooth, continuous emission of steam, consistent with the usual appearance of hot cup steam.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transformed yarn pattern on the fabric retain consistent knit stitches and natural thread flow without visible pixelation or irregular textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yarn pattern is simplified, likely due to artistic style, but it retains a consistent look without any apparent pixelation. The texture and flow appear uniform, suggesting it maintains a cohesive and realistic depiction of knit stitches for the style of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the writing panel positioned within the open book pages such that its edges align naturally with the page boundaries and the knitted border matches the texture and color of the surrounding fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the open book's writing panel aligns well with the page boundaries. The edges of the book and the knitted border appear appropriately textured and colored to match the fabric theme of the illustration, maintaining consistency in style and design.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the added lamplight effect produce a gradual glow around the book and cup without creating unnatural bright spots or conflicting shadows on the armchair or wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp light effect is absent, as this is a stylized and simplified illustration. Therefore, there are no gradations of lighting around the book and cup evident, let alone unnatural bright spots or shadows. The question presupposes an added lamplight effect that does not exist in the minimalist style of Image B.",
