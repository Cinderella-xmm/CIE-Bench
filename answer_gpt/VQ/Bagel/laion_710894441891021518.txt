    "Question": "Q1: Do the butterfly wings formed from the branches have smooth, continuous outlines without visible breaks, warping, or misaligned segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings exhibit smooth and continuous outlines, indicating careful integration onto the overall structure without any visible breaks, warping, or misaligned segments. This suggests the edited wings have been seamlessly incorporated using symmetrical outlines.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the luminescent patterns on the butterfly wings evenly distributed with soft edges and no visible digital artifacts like halos or sharp contrast jumps?",
    "explanation": "The luminescent patterns on the wings in Image B are evenly distributed, with soft edges indicating harmonious blending and absence of digital artifacts like halos or sharp contrast jumps, ensuring a coherent appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the glowing eyes and antlers positioned in a way that respects the original branching structure, with no unnatural overlaps or floating elements?",
    "explanation": "The glowing eyes and antlers are positioned to respect the overall structure in Image B, integrating seamlessly without unnatural overlaps or floating elements, suggesting thoughtful design and positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the stone base retain natural stone texture, including subtle variations in color and surface depth, without appearing uniformly flat or artificially rendered?",
    "explanation": "The stone base in Image B retains a natural stone texture with subtle variations in color and depth, emphasizing reality rather than appearing uniformly flat or artificially rendered.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the bark-like textures on the trunk flow continuously along its contours without sudden breaks, unnatural ridges, or inconsistent scaling?",
    "explanation": "The bark-like textures of the trunk exhibit continuous flow along its contours in Image B, with no sudden breaks, unnatural ridges, or inconsistent scaling, indicating careful attention to textural detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the remaining leaves, soil, and root structures clearly visible and undistorted, with no blurring, loss of edge definition, or missing details?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is primarily on the edited statue structure. As such, leaves, soil, and roots are not prominently visible. Therefore, the question does not apply to this edited context where traditional plant structures are not represented.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the glowing elements cast subtle ambient light on nearby surfaces, and do shadows from the wings, eyes, and antlers align with the sceneâ€™s lighting direction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, glowing elements do seem to cast ambient light given their illumination level, but no explicit shadows or lighting direction adherence is visible. Hence, there is insufficient evidence of ambient effects or aligned shadows.",
    "answer": "No"
