      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the plush pigeon have a rounded, soft-bodied shape with no visible distortion in limbs or head, and does it maintain a natural posture consistent with a seated stuffed animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush pigeon is depicted with a rounded and soft-bodied shape. The limbs, which include wings and feet, appear plump and proportionate, showing no signs of distortion. Additionally, the head is smoothly rounded without any unusual or sharp shapes, and the pigeon is seated in an upright position typical of stuffed animals. This upright and seated posture implies stability and comfort, characteristic of plush toys designed to sit naturally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blue and gray areas on the plush pigeon’s body evenly colored with soft transitions, and do the feather-like patterns appear as continuous, low-relief designs on fabric rather than sharp, digital lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush pigeon displays areas of blue and gray that are evenly colored with gradual transitions between them, suggesting a fabric texture rather than a digital, high-contrast one. The feather patterns are designed in a low-relief style, giving the impression of being stitched onto the fabric. This provides a tactile appearance that is consistent with plush toys, lacking any indication of sharp, digitally-imposed lines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the architectural elements (columns, arch, distant buildings) display a uniform, matte surface with visible embossed details that resemble cookie dough or icing, and do they lack shiny reflections or metallic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural elements indeed resemble the texture of cookie dough or icing, with a consistent matte surface. These elements lack metallic reflections or sheen, emphasizing a softened look with the texture visible as if sculpted from a soft, edible material. The embossed details contribute to this appearance, drawing parallels to decorative techniques used in baking for texture effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a wooden shelf beneath the plush pigeon that is flat, horizontally aligned, and has visible wood grain and natural edge wear, with a shadow extending downward and to the right consistent with the sky light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a flat, horizontally aligned wooden shelf beneath the plush pigeon. The texture indicates a visible wood grain pattern, implying a natural, organic material. The edges exhibit slight wear consistent with wood usage over time. Shadows are projected downward and to the right, consistent with the direction of light suggested by the scene’s ambience, confirming realistic shadow behavior.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all elements in the image (plush pigeon, shelf, cookie structures) share the same lighting direction and shadow behavior, with no overlapping shadows or missing occlusions that suggest inconsistent depth or positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all elements, including the plush pigeon, shelf, and cookie-like structures, conform to the same lighting direction, casting shadows consistently downwards and to the right. This uniformity in lighting and shadow suggests that all objects adhere to the same spatial positioning and depth perception, with no overlapping shadows or missing occlusions that might otherwise indicate discrepancies or inconsistencies in their arrangement.",
