      "question": "Are the limbs of the chibi character straight and properly connected at joints, with no visible kinks or disproportionate lengths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the chibi character appear stylized and slightly exaggerated, typical in chibi-style art, which often depicts characters with oversized heads and small bodies. However, the limbs seem to be evenly proportionate according to the design style and are connected at the joints without visible irregularities or distortions. The lines are smooth, suggesting competent alignment and proportion within the context of stylized chibi art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the face of the chibi character have symmetrical eyes and a clearly defined mouth, with no distorted lines or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters feature exaggerated facial characteristics, which are common in chibi art. Despite being stylized, the eyes appear symmetrical, and the features, such as the mouth, are clearly defined with smooth, consistent lines and shading that match the artistic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the kimono clearly visible with sharp edges and no color smudging or pixelation, even after color enhancement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the chibi-style simplification, the floral patterns on the kimono are distinct with defined shapes and vibrant colors. They exhibit no noticeable smudging or pixelation, suggesting a sharp execution of the design elements. The patterns adapt well to the cartoonish style of the chibi figures, maintained with clarity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hand holding the cherry blossom branch composed of five fingers with natural curvature and no extra digits or deformed shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the chibi character are designed in a simplified manner typical to the art style, often not showing the full five fingers distinctly. They capture the essence of holding a branch without specific detailing of five separate fingers, which aligns with the simplification usual in chibi art. Consequently, there are no extra digits or noticeably deformed shapes.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the falling petals in the dancing pose follow a downward arc consistent with gravity, and are they evenly distributed without clustering or floating above the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of cherry blossom petals follows a patterned dispersion around the characters, suggestive of motion influenced by gravity, typical in decorative arts. However, due to the artistic style, there's no precise adherence to a realistic gravitational arc, and some petals can appear floating, which indicates creative liberty rather than scientific accuracy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background serving as the magnetic sheet appears uniformly colored in pastel shades. There are no visible texture artifacts, stripes, or color shifts across its surface, maintaining consistency complementary to the chibi-style aesthetics.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all four chibi figures are fully visible and separated, without any overlap or being cut off. They appear evenly spaced, showing clarity and distinctiveness with sufficient space on the magnetic sheet, ensuring a balanced composition.",
