      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the stitches on the cactusâ€™s body and sombrero clearly visible, evenly spaced, and consistent with the knitting style of the surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the cactus and its sombrero display a clear, consistent knitting style. The stitches appear uniform in size and spacing, indicative of a well-crafted crochet toy. This consistency matches the detailed craftsmanship one would expect from a knitted product, which is characterized by visible loops and patterns in the stitches. Given this visual information combined with general knowledge of knitting, the analysis infers that the stitches are indeed even and consistent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the mane and striped pattern on the donkey display natural yarn-like texture and proper alignment without visible distortions or gaps between stitches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donkey's mane and striped pattern demonstrate a typical yarn texture, with individual yarn strands visible, especially in the mane. The colors are vibrant and the stripes align well, suggesting careful crafting. The lack of gaps or distortions corresponds with high-quality knitted products which maintain pattern integrity across different sections. This consistency suggests a well-executed design typical of handmade toys.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the limbs and body proportions of both the cactus and donkey preserved in a way that reflects typical plush toy design without unnatural stretching or shrinking?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plush toys in Image B exhibit proportions that are characteristic of standard plush dolls. The cactus has short limbs appropriate for its design, while the donkey maintains a balanced form, indicative of typical plush toy construction. There is no visible distortion in limb length or body size, which confirms that proportions are preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the packaging box positioned in a way that suggests it is part of the same scene, with consistent lighting and shadow direction relative to the plush toys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a packaging box containing the cactus and donkey. The lighting on the box is even and the shadows are consistent with the direction seen on the plush toys. However, the outsized, vibrant design of the box is noticeably different in appearance and scale compared to that of a standard photography setting. The plush toys inside are well illuminated, implying artificial setting consistency but lacking real-world shadow dynamics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged edges, color bleeding, or double outlines at the boundaries between the cactus, pot, donkey, and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the borders of the objects in Image B, there are no visible signs of jagged edges or color bleeding that would suggest poor editing or errors. The transitions between the cactus, pot, donkey, and their background appear smooth. The image presents clear delineations between different elements, indicative of high-quality image work which avoids such artifacts.",
