    "Question": "Q1: Are the roof, walls, and window frames of the Japanese house replaced with colored glass panels outlined by black lead without distorting the original building’s geometry or introducing misaligned or broken lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the building is rendered in a stained glass style, which features the use of colored glass panels separated by black lead lines. This style maintains the original structure's geometry, where the house, including its roof, walls, and window frames, are replaced with colored glass without breaking lines or distorting the shape. The lead lines accurately trace the outlines of the house, preserving its form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Have the red trees on both sides of the house been converted into symmetrical floral motifs made of red and green glass segments that maintain their original placement and scale without unnatural stretching or fragmentation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the red trees appear to be converted into floral motifs, adopting a stained glass style where segments of red and green glass make up these motifs. They seem to be maintained in their original scale and general placement relative to the house, though the imagery translates the natural tree form into a more abstract floral form fitting the stained glass aesthetic. There is no evidence of unnatural stretching or fragmentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the red moon represented as a series of concentric gradient circles in stained glass style, with smooth color transitions and no jagged edges or irregularities in its form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is depicted as a solid circle with a gradient from red to orange, typical of stained glass style representations, emphasizing smooth transitions of color. There are no jagged edges or irregularities noted in the form, maintaining the circular shape and gradient smoothly.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are all structural and decorative lines—such as those framing glass panels, outlining windows, and defining floral motifs—uniform, continuous, and properly aligned without breaks, overlaps, or uneven thickness?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the all structural and decorative lines associated with stained glass, including those outlining the individual glass pieces and creating the designs, appear uniform and continuous. They frame and define areas without overlaps or breaks, maintaining consistent thickness throughout.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the reflections in the water accurately mirror the stained glass version of the house, red floral trees, and red moon with correct proportions, alignment, and color fidelity, without distortion or blurring?",
    "explanation": "Image B doesn't display a reflection of the stained glass style house, floral motifs, or sun that corresponds to the altered elements within the image itself, so there are no reflections apparent to compare. In stained glass, reflections might not be present or rendered due to the nature of the depiction.",
    "answer": "No"
