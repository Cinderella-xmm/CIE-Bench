      "question": "Does the bodice and skirt exhibit natural fabric folds and draping consistent with the weight and volume of Victorian-era garments, especially at the waist and hip regions?",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bodice and skirt show realistic fabric folds and draping that is characteristic of the dense materials used in Victorian-era clothing.
