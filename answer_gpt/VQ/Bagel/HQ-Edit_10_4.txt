    "Question": "Q1: Does the facial area exhibit a consistent dark wood texture with natural grain patterns, maintaining accurate facial proportions and avoiding distortions such as warped features or inconsistent surface depth?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the facial area is blurred, making it impossible to assess the wood texture, grain patterns, and accurate facial proportions. In terms of reasoning, one would expect a consistent dark wood texture with natural grain patterns for maintaining facial proportions in a carved sculpture, avoiding distortions. However, due to the blur, this assessment cannot be made solely based on Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the patterns on the clothing rendered as deeply incised carvings with visible relief depth, and do they preserve the original arrangement of colors and shapes without blurring or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the clothing are intricate, with deeply incised carvings that have visible relief depth. The colors and the arrangement of shapes appear accurate, consistent with a well-rendered sculpture. On examining these aspects, the depth and preservation of pattern details and colors is apparent, indicating high craftsmanship.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the beads on the crown and earrings clearly defined with vibrant, non-blended colors, appearing as painted details on the wooden surface rather than merged or distorted textures?",
    "explanation": "By observing Image B, the beads on the crown and earrings show distinct colors such as orange, blue, and green. These colors are well-defined and individually distinct, suggesting that they are painted details on the wooden surface. This visual clarity of the beads supports the notion that they are not merged or distorted.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background composed of low-relief carved plant forms that maintain spatial depth and botanical structure, without flattening or losing the sense of layered vegetation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of high-relief carvings and patterns on the border rather than plant forms. These patterns provide texture and depth but do not resemble botanical structures or layered vegetation typically found in terrains. The intricate carvings are highlighted but differ from Image A's painted vegetation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the entire sculpture surface display a consistent polished finish with no visible rendering artifacts, such as edge halos, texture repetition, or missing fine details in the hair, beads, or clothing carvings?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the sculpture surface appears to have a consistent polished finish without visible rendering artifacts. The hair, beads, and clothing are finely detailed, with sharp textures and patterns. There are no signs of edge halos or texture repetition, indicating a high-quality rendering of the sculpture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
