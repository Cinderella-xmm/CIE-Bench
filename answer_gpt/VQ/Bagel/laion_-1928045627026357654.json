    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the male's shirt display a consistent 3D plush texture with no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural shading that breaks the illusion of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B involves examining the illusion of depth and texture achieved by the plush design on the male's shirt. The shirt appears to have a uniform and consistent plush texture, enhancing its 3D appearance, and is free from pixelation or jagged edges that could disrupt this illusion. The shading maintains smooth transitions, reinforcing the depth perception commonly associated with plush materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the collar of the male's shirt proportionally enlarged without distorting the neck or shoulder line, and does it maintain smooth contours without sharp or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collar appears properly proportioned relative to the rest of the shirt, fitting around the neck naturally without any noticeable distortion. The contours of the collar maintain smoothness, indicating good craftsmanship in proportioning and integrating the enlarged elements without creating sharp or unnatural breaks.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the pleats on the female's pants symmetrically arranged and physically plausible, without floating or overlapping layers that defy gravity or fabric tension?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases pleats that are arranged symmetrically on the female's skirt, not pants, as commonly expected in fabric designs. The pleats appear physically plausible, adhering to the expected behaviors influenced by gravity and fabric tension, without instances of floating or overlap.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the enlarged sleeve on the female’s top extend naturally from the shoulder without distorting her arm or causing unnatural gaps or overlaps near the elbow and hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the female’s top exhibits a sleeve that extends naturally from her shoulder, maintaining smooth integration with the rest of the shirt and her arm. There are no unnatural gaps or overlaps around the elbow and hand, showcasing a proportionate design typical of well-fitted clothing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the pastel-colored stage beneath the characters evenly lit and proportionally scaled, with no abrupt color shifts or shadow inconsistencies that suggest poor integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a pastel-colored stage that appears evenly lit. The scaling of the stage matches the proportions of the characters, and the lighting does not exhibit abrupt shifts or shadow inconsistencies. This indicates well-executed integration supporting the overall scene's composition.",
