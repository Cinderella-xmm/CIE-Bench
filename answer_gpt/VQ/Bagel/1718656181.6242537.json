      "question": "Are the cloud formations above the explosion composed of distinct geometric shapes that follow the overall contour of the mushroom cloud without disrupting its volumetric form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cloud formations above the explosion are depicted with simplified, stylized geometric shapes that follow the contour of the mushroom cloud, as commonly used in pop art styles. The large pink cloud does mimic the shape of a mushroom cloud and retains its volumetric impression due to the consistent outline that matches the source contour of such explosions. This maintains the integrity of the shape commonly associated with explosive clouds.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the neon-colored elements in the explosion maintain consistent brightness and contrast relative to the surrounding sky and water, avoiding abrupt or physically implausible luminance shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon colors used in the explosion are vivid and consistent with the surrounding color environment, typical of pop art style. The explosion is rendered in contrasting bright colors against the turquoise backdrop that represents the sky and water, and even though these are bold choices, they maintain a consistent aesthetic without abrupt or physically implausible luminance shifts. This stylistic choice enhances the vibrancy of the scene in a coherent manner with respect to the pop art theme.",

      "question": "Are the palm trees depicted with thick black outlines and simplified shapes, positioned correctly along the beach wall without overlapping or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees are illustrated with thick black outlines and have simplified shapes consistent with pop art styles. They are correctly positioned along what represents a beach area, without overlapping each other or misaligned edges. This choice maintains the stylized integrity while ensuring the placement appears logical within the context of the scene.",

      "question": "Has the islandâ€™s terrain been reduced to abstract geometric shapes that maintain correct spatial relationships with the sea and horizon, without floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the island's terrain is stylized into abstract geometric shapes consistent with a pop art theme. These shapes maintain appropriate spatial relationships with the sea and the horizon, presenting a coherent composition. There are no floating or disconnected sections; everything appears integrated within the scene, respecting spatial coherence.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sky and water rendered with flat colors and clean outlines, matching the pop art style, without visible texture degradation or mismatched lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky and water are given flat color treatments with clean outlines fitting within the pop art aesthetic. The turquoise blue used for the water and the sky is distinctly flat, with no visible texture degradation or mismatched lighting effects, enhancing the artistic coherence of the image.",
