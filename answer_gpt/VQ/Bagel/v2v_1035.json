      "question": "Do the Russian nesting dolls maintain the recognizable shape and proportions of the giraffe without introducing unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents Russian nesting dolls with a giraffe theme. The giraffe's unique feature is its elongated neck, which is captured in the tallest doll. The dolls maintain typical nesting doll shapes, with the base wider and curving toward the narrow top. Despite the giraffe's features being stylized, it doesn't show awkward geometric distortions conflicting with the intended giraffe theme. Generally, the dolls exhibit a harmonious blend of giraffe characteristics in their design while retaining traditional proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the Russian nesting dolls consistent with the giraffe's fur pattern, avoiding unnatural or overly smooth surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the Russian nesting dolls is painted to mimic the giraffe's spots. While not three-dimensional nor textured like actual fur, the painted pattern resembles a giraffe reasonably, with heart-shaped spots being artistically consistent across the dolls. They do not display an unnatural smoothness that would differ from the painted representation typical of Russian dolls.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the different sizes of the Russian nesting dolls smooth, without visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Traditional Russian nesting dolls are known for their smooth transitions in size and fit, having no visible seams when closed properly. Image B reflects this craftsmanship; the dolls appear smoothly graduated in size, maintaining visual continuity across each nested figure without unpleasant edges or visible seams.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the arrangement of the Russian nesting dolls on the wooden table look balanced and natural, without any dolls appearing to float or overlap unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Russian nesting dolls in Image B are placed on a flat surface with careful spacing to ensure visual balance. There is no overlapping, nor do any dolls give the illusion of floating. They are uniformly touching the tabletop, making the arrangement appear deliberate and natural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the Russian nesting dolls and the wooden table consistent with the lighting in the original image, avoiding any unrealistic highlights or dark spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dolls with ambient lighting that suggests a controlled indoor environment. The lighting is soft, creating slight shadows that fall naturally on the table, without harsh highlights or unrealistically dark areas. While Image A seems to have outdoor lighting, Image B's indoor setting does not conflict with realistic lighting expectations given its context, hence maintaining consistency within its own setup.",
