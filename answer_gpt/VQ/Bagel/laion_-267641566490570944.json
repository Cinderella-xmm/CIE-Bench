      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the crystal horns on the dragon head proportionally sized relative to the mountain peak and do they exhibit natural refraction and transparency consistent with crystalline material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon features crystal horns protruding from its head. Analyzing their size relative to the mountain peaks, these horns seem large for a mythical creature but proportionate considering the dragon's overall scale. The horns do not vividly display transparency or refraction typically associated with crystalline materials; instead, they appear opaque, lacking the transparency or unique lighting effects of crystal.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ridge lines forming the dragon body show smooth, flowing transitions without abrupt angular bends or disproportionate thickness changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's body is shown to move fluidly from the head, with no sharp bends or noticeable inconsistencies in thickness. The ridges maintain a natural, smooth curve suggestive of a living creature. This flowing continuity reflects careful design in avoiding abrupt transitions, maintaining appropriate proportional changes along the body lines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rocky scales and moss-covered spines distributed in a way that mimics natural erosion and plant growth patterns without repeating textures or uniform spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's body is covered in rocky scales and moss-like textures. These features are distributed with a sense of randomness that would mimic the natural formation of rock and plant life, avoiding uniform spacing. Although designed features like these may use repeating patterns, the careful variance in size and shape gives the impression of organic growth, consistent with natural patterns.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the dragon tail fade into the mist with a soft gradient, maintaining visibility of form through haze without sharp cutoffs or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts the dragon's tail extending into the misty background. The transition from the visible tail into the mist is smooth and gradual, achieving a soft gradient that maintains a coherent connection with the rest of the body, avoiding abrupt cutoffs or a disjointed, floating appearance. This demonstrates attention to detail in blending the creature with its environment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dragon features align with the sun's position in the sky and match the lighting on surrounding mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sun's position, left of the mountain scene, dictates the lighting conditions in Image B. Light and shadow interaction with the dragon is consistent; shadows are cast in the expected direction, and highlights align with the sunlight's angle, similar to the surrounding mountains. This consistency suggests a seamless integration within the lighting dynamics of the scene.",
