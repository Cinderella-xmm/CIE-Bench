      "question": "Does the themed box appear to have a natural industrial aesthetic without any visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The themed box in Image B displays an industrial design, and its color and pattern attempt to evoke a mechanical and technical feel. However, upon inspection, there are visible inconsistencies and artifacts in the texture. The pattern inside the box has an unusual look, and the text 'Fahnal Drimes' is distorted. These textual and design elements detract from the natural aesthetic and introduce unnatural textures and artifacts.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and angles of the themed box in isometric perspective consistent and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the analysis of Image B, the themed box is presented with an attempt at isometric perspective, which aims to show three dimensions in a way that represents depth. However, there are signs of distortion in the text alignment and the outer box edges, indicating inconsistencies in proportions and perspective. This distortion is particularly visible in the text 'Fahnal Drimes,' which appears stretched and misaligned.",

      "question": "Do the bearings and components inside the box retain their fine details and appear precise without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bearings and components inside the box seem to lack intricate, high-resolution details typically expected in such objects. The objects inside appear simplified, without precise texturing, and some edges are less sharp and defined. This lack of detail results in a less realistic appearance compared to actual mechanical components.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the metallic texture and intricate design of the primary bearing outside the box rendered photorealistically without any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The primary bearing outside the box in Image B shows an attempt at metallic rendering. However, the texture and design lack realism because of visible distortion and mottled texture properties instead of smooth, consistent surfaces expected in photorealistic rendering. These anomalies in texture suggest that the bearing was not rendered photorealistically.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bearings and components arranged in an organized manner both inside and outside the box, contributing to visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon evaluating Image B, the arrangement of bearings and components inside the box attempts an organized layout. However, there are signs of misalignment and inconsistent spacing among components which negate the effect of a neatly organized setting. The uneven positioning inside the compartments and the oddly placed bearing outside the box disrupt visual credibility.",
