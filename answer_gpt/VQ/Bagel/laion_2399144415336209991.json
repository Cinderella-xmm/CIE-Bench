      "question": "Are the enhanced beads on the bride's shoulder straps evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the fabric's surface without appearing detached or unnaturally sharp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoulder straps of the bride's dress are stylized in a cartoon form, and finer details like beads may be omitted due to the nature of the edit. In cartoon styling, intricate beadwork may not be depicted with the same specificity or texture. Therefore, while the beads may appear aligned with the fabric's surface in a cartoon context, they might not display a realistic texture or sharpness as they do in a photograph. Consequently, the analysis concludes that in the cartoon representation, enhanced beads do not exhibit the detailed characteristics of spacing and texture observed in real-life objects, hence the answer is 'No'.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the enlarged lapel of the groom's suit proportionally consistent with the rest of the jacket, and does it retain a smooth edge without jagged lines or distorted angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the groom's suit lapel is presented in a cartoon style, where proportions are often exaggerated but should still maintain visual balance. The lapel on the cartoon groom appears proportionally consistent with the jacket, maintaining a smooth and continuous edge. Cartoon stylization typically involves clear line work and defined shapes, offering a cohesive and proportionate appearance without irregularities. This suggests that the lapel complies with the described attributes, and therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Do the hands in the \"holding hands\" pose have five fingers each, correctly aligned joints, and natural skin texture without distortion or overlapping limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon style might simplify details like fingers for aesthetic and visual clarity. Even with a cartoon rendering, the expectation is for each hand to have five fingers, aligned properly. However, the simplified and stylized nature of cartoon art focuses less on anatomical precision and more on representation; thus, fine details like skin texture or intricate joint alignment may be sacrificed. The hands appear to only approximately represent these details due to the stylistic choices of cartoons. Thus, the answer is 'No', as the natural details are largely absent in cartoon form.",

      "question": "Is the heart-shaped border fully contained around the couple without cutting into their bodies or clothing, and are the gold trim and floral engravings clearly defined without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heart-shaped border encapsulates the couple in a cartoon depiction, and visual analysis shows it complements their outline, staying clear of their bodies and attire. The gold trim and floral engravings exhibit clear delineation, indicative of careful stylization typical in cartoons, maintaining visual harmony and clarity. Proper alignment and distinct features in a cartoon image ensure elements are not blurred or misaligned, confirming 'Yes' for this observation.",

      "question": "Are the cartoonized features of both the bride and groom uniformly stylized, with consistent line work and shading that do not clash with each other or create abrupt transitions in texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the bride and groom are depicted in cartoon form. A consistent style can be recognized through uniform line work and shading which aligns throughout both figures. Cartoonized images typically adhere to a unified approach to character design, ensuring harmony in style so the figures complement each other without abrupt transitions. The visual consistency seen in line work and shading supports the interpretation that no element clashes with the surroundings, leading to the answer 'Yes'.",
