    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed bottle maintain the same elongated vertical silhouette as the original dress, with no compression or stretching of the form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress design is not transformed into a bottle, but rather the design alterations remain within the fabric of the dress. The vertical silhouette remains consistent with the original. There is no visible transformation that resembles a bottle, and thus the silhouette does not experience any compression or stretching. The dress silhouette in Image B maintains its form consistent with the original.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the petal motifs clearly visible as raised embossments on the glass surface, with consistent depth and spacing matching the original dress's design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petal motifs are part of the dress fabric design and not part of a glass surface. The motifs are not transformed into embossments typical for glass surfaces but are rendered as part of the texture and color design of the dress. Therefore, they are not embossments with depth and spacing as might be seen on a glass surface.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cap shaped like a stylized red flower with natural petal curvature and symmetry, and does it sit properly on the bottle neck without floating or overlapping unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a bottle with a cap; rather, it remains a dress. There is no transformation into a bottle and thus no cap, flower-shaped or otherwise, on any bottle neck. Consequently, evaluation of the cap's shape, curvature, or placement does not apply as such an object is not present.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the metallic label seamlessly attached to the glass surface with smooth edges, realistic reflection, and legible cursive text, without blurring, misalignment, or shadow mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a label visible on the dress held by the individual, resembling a clutch or accessory rather than being attached to a glass surface. The label appears with cursive text and holds a realistic reflection characteristic of a printed accessory rather than a bottle label. The attachment to a 'glass surface' is not applicable here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the neck, body, and base of the bottle proportionally balanced and structurally sound, with no unnatural tapering or abrupt shape changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B does not depict a bottle but rather a dress design, analysis of a bottle's neck, body, and base cannot be conducted. The dress in Image B maintains its garment form where no proportion changes related to a glass bottle are observed, thus this evaluation is non-applicable.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, pixelation, or color bleeding at the boundary where the fabric dress transitions into the glass bottle, indicating poor blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As Image B does not transition into a glass bottle but remains a dress, there is no transition boundary to inspect. Therefore, questions of pixelation, color bleeding, or blending at a transition region to glass do not apply to this image analysis.",
