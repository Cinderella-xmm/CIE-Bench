      "question": "Does the Ancient Greek-style armor fit the characterâ€™s torso and limbs without distorting muscle contours or creating unnatural gaps or overlaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Ancient Greek-style armor appears to be well-fitted to the character's torso and limbs. The armor follows the natural muscle contours without creating visible distortions or gaps. It's designed to look like traditional Greek armor, which typically includes a breastplate and greaves that closely follow the shape of the human body. This suggests that the artist considered anatomical structure when designing the armor.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the joints of the armored limbs articulated properly, and is the sword held in a position that does not bend or stretch the arm beyond natural limits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armored limbs appear to be articulated properly, with joints such as the elbows and knees visually aligned with the anatomical positions of these body parts. The character holding the sword does so in a natural stance, without the arm appearing unnaturally bent or stretched, ensuring that the pose reflects realistic movement.",

      "question": "Is the barbell placed evenly across the shoulders with both hands gripping it in a balanced stance, and is the back posture upright and stable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character with the barbell has it placed evenly across his shoulders. The hands seem to grip the barbell symmetrically, and the stance suggests a balanced posture. The character's back appears to be upright and stable, indicative of proper form and balance when lifting a barbell, which is crucial for avoiding injury and ensuring a realistic depiction.",

      "question": "Is the head proportionally aligned with the neck and upper torso in all three versions without appearing oversized, undersized, or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each character's head appears proportionally aligned with their respective neck and upper torso. Proportions seem consistent across different depictions, without any head appearing too large, too small, or misaligned with the body, which is critical for maintaining realistic humanoid proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands in all three versions have exactly five fingers, proper joint curvature, and natural grip on the sword or barbell without distortion or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are depicted with five fingers each, featuring proper joint curvature that reflects a realistic human hand structure. The grip on the sword and barbell looks natural, without distortion or extra digits, indicating careful attention to anatomical accuracy and artistic details.",

      "question": "Are the shadows and highlights on the armor, clothing, and props consistent with a single light source and do they enhance the three-dimensional appearance without creating floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows and highlights in Image B are consistent with a single light source, enhancing the three-dimensional appearance of the armor, clothing, and props. The lighting gives depth to the characters and avoids creating floating or disconnected elements, thereby maintaining the integrity of the overall image.",
