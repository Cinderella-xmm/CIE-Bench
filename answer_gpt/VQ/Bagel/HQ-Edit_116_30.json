      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the entire cathedral structure appear uniformly rendered in warm stained wood with consistent grain patterns and realistic wood textures across all surfaces, including spires, arches, and tracery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral is distinctly presented as a wooden model within a shadow box. The entire surface of the model shows a consistent wood texture that accurately reflects the characteristics of stained wood, including grain patterns. The spires, arches, and tracery are all rendered uniformly in this material, exhibiting no visible color inconsistencies or variations that would detract from the impression of a solid, singular wooden model. Common sense suggests that the entire structure is intended to mimic wood craftsmanship rather than being a mosaic of various materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the edges of the shadow box clearly defined, structurally coherent, and proportionally sized relative to the cathedral model, with no visible gaps, misalignments, or floating components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a shadow box containing the cathedral model. The edges of the box are cleanly defined and appear well-constructed, providing structural coherence. Visual clues indicate that the box fits well around the model, with no gaps or misalignments. The cathedral model is neatly positioned within the box, suggesting a deliberate and proportional design. Common sense dictates that if there were any floating components or improper alignment, it would visually disrupt the overall presentation, which is not the case here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tiny pews and chandeliers positioned correctly within the interior of the cathedral model, maintaining proper scale and alignment with architectural features like columns and vaults, and do they cast consistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the miniature cathedral model, detailed elements such as pews and chandeliers can be seen. These components are properly positioned and appear to be scaled relative to the surrounding architectural features, including columns and vaults. Shadows cast by these elements enhance the realism of their alignment within the space, showing no inconsistencies that would detract from the model's coherence. The expectation within such models is an accurate representation of how these objects interact with the architecture, which is captured well here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the clock mechanism located at the back of the model, featuring visible gears and a moving path for small figures, with no distorted shapes, inconsistent materials, or implausible motion trajectories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a detailed view where a clock mechanism is evidently positioned within the model's interior. The gears and paths suggest a functional clock setup, and the materials are consistent with the cathedral's wooden theme. There are no visible distortions or irregular shapes in the mechanism. Objects like gears tend to remain fixed and orderly in such setups, with any motion path designed to be feasible and consistent with the overall function, suggesting the model was crafted with precision.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the intricate gothic carvings, including the rose window, flying buttresses, and sculptural elements, retain sharp detail and accurate geometry in the miniature model without visible blurring, pixelation, or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a miniature version of a gothic cathedral with detailed carvings around the rose window, flying buttresses, and other sculptural elements. These features are rendered with sharp detail and maintain their geometric accuracy, which is vital for capturing the intricacy of Gothic architecture. The absence of blurring, pixelation, or deformation indicates high attention to the model's crafting process, aligning with expectations for a well-executed miniature replica that emphasizes precision in architectural detailing.",
