      "question": "Are the lockers in the background seamlessly replaced with mid-century modern showroom elements without visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements such as the lockers are replaced with a mid-century modern showroom design. This includes a plain white wall, a framed artwork, and a chair. These elements appear to be integrated smoothly into the image without any visible artifacts or textures that seem out of place, such as mismatched patterns or distortions. The design choices reflect style consistency, and maintaining a clean visual transition ensures a seamless edit.",

      "question": "Does the luxurious piece of designer furniture appear proportionally correct and physically plausible in place of the jersey display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, where the jersey display was initially located, a designer chair now occupies that space. The chair appears proportionally correct in relation to the other objects and characters in the image. It fits the space naturally, suggesting an understanding of perspective and scale that aligns with typical furniture arrangements in showrooms. There isn't any distortion or proportion issue evident that would make it look unrealistic or poorly edited.",

      "question": "Do the characters' gestures and body language remain natural and consistent with the new showroom setting and the luxurious furniture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are maintaining the same gestures as Image A, with one character showcasing something and the others observing. Despite the change in background to a showroom setting, their gestures and body language remain appropriate and consistent, implying that they could be discussing or appraising the furniture. The change in setting from locker room to showroom does not introduce any awkwardness or mismatch with their expressions and movements.",

      "question": "Is the lighting and shadow in the showroom consistent with the new setting, without introducing any unnatural or inconsistent effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a plain white wall, artwork, and furniture without distinct lighting or shadow anomalies. The scene uses lighting that appears consistent with an indoor showroom, and there is no evident inconsistency, such as conflicting light sources or unrealistic shadow placements. The lighting is harmonized with the environment's elements, maintaining a natural and realistic presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the characters and their clothing remained visually consistent and unchanged, aside from the background and the jersey display being replaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the transition from Image A to Image B, the characters and their clothing remain unchanged visually. Their attire, featuring sports uniforms, and all facial and body attributes remain consistent. This suggests that the edit focused solely on altering the background elements, such as the lockers and jersey display, while maintaining the characters themselves without modification, ensuring continuity in the edited scene.",
