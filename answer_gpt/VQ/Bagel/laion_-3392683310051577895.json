      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the curled horn-like structures on both armrests have smooth, continuous curves without jagged edges or inconsistent thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horn-like structures on the armrests are visually complex, with spiraled details that give them a textured appearance. Typically, horn-like elements can have a varied thickness due to their natural tapering design. However, in terms of their digital rendering, these horns exhibit a consistent visual texture that does not appear jagged or discontinuous in their curves, indicating a refined digital illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bark-textured scales on the backrest evenly distributed, with natural variations in shape and depth, and do they follow the original contour of the sofa without tearing or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the backrest of the sofa with a bark-like texture. The scales have a consistent pattern, and the texture seems to follow the contour of the sofa, suggesting a smooth integration with the sofa's structure. There is no visual indication of tearing or misalignment, which often appears as jagged edges or breaks in pattern.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mossy, leafy mane extend continuously from the top of the cushions, showing layered depth and natural variation in green tones, without sharp seams or floating leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mossy textured area on the sofa's top shows a continuous extension without sharp seams. The variation in green tones gives depth, indicating a natural pattern typical in mossy textures. There are no signs of floating leaves or unnatural separations that would break continuity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the emerald eyes positioned centrally above the middle cushion, emitting a soft, diffused glow that casts subtle shadows on the surrounding leather without harsh outlines or overexposure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes on the sofa are centrally positioned in relation to the middle cushion. They emit a glow that is well-integrated with the surrounding textures. The glow is not harsh in appearance and there are subtle shadows, indicating a well-controlled digital light effect that avoids overexposure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wooden limbs extend from under the front edge of the sofa, resting firmly on the carpet, with vines wrapped around clawed ends that appear structurally sound and proportionate to the sofa's size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the sofa has a wooden texture that suggests it mimics limbs more than having physical extensions like true pieces of wood or claws. There aren't visible limbs at the front extending to the carpet as per typical wooden limbs description, and as such no structure akin to clawed ends or vines was observed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there faint, localized glows or energy effects near the limbs or eyes that blend into the environment without creating visible artifacts like pixelation or unnatural color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The evaluated image shows a glow effect primarily around the eye region. The glow appears to be soft and well-blended into the environment, showing no signs of pixelation or harsh color transitions that would stand out as artifacts. The digital illustration thus indicates a smooth integration of glow effects.",
