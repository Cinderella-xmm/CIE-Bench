    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the boat exhibit consistent aged wood texture with natural grain patterns and no repeating or unnatural surface artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a wooden boat within a framed scene. Analyzing the boat's depiction with world knowledge, the texture appears smooth and uniform, suggesting a stylized representation rather than one with intricate grain or texture typical of natural aged wood. The consistent pattern indicates a simplified portrayal often seen in artistic or crafted works, lacking natural grain variance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the distant hills rendered with smooth pastel blue gradients that transition naturally without sharp boundaries or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hills are represented using a solid pastel blue color without a gradient transition, typical for artistic renderings or simplified models. The lack of gradient and pixelation indicates a deliberate choice for clear borders rather than a smooth transition, consistent with stylized representation rather than realistic imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small, clear droplet-like etchings on the water surface that resemble ripples without disrupting the reflection or causing visual distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water surface in Image B includes droplet-like shapes that simulate ripples. These shapes are distinctly outlined and don't cause reflection or distortion, characteristic of etching styles in crafted or artistic scenes, ensuring clarity without typical water surface textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a hand-carved wooden frame surrounding the scene with realistic texture, depth, and structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a frame around the scene that exhibits a wooden texture with visible grain patterns, suggesting an effort to depict a realistic wooden appearance. The depth and structure seem consistent with real wooden frames commonly used in handcrafted artworks for enclosing scenes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the boat, water, and hills arranged in layered 3D cutouts with correct spatial depth and no misalignment or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a scene organized in layers, typical of shadowbox or diorama-style setups, where each component appears placed to provide depth. The spatial arrangement lacks any evidence of misalignment or floating artifacts, indicating a coherent design intent for dimensional representation.",
