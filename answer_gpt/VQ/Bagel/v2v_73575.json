      "question": "Does the origami bird on the left retain a natural appearance with no visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The origami bird on the left in Image B is designed to look as though it is made from geometric paper pieces. This gives it a stylized, crafted look rather than representing a natural bird. The visible edges and lines from the origami folding technique are intentional and part of its design, not artifacts or errors from editing. Thus, while it doesnâ€™t look 'natural' in the sense of mimicking a real bird, these elements are not artifacts but rather consistent with origami art style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the luminous crystalline structure of the bird on the right visually credible without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird on the right appears to be constructed from a faceted, crystal-like material, with a translucent and reflective quality. The structure is consistent and without apparent flaws, such as distortions or breakages that would detract from its visual credibility. The facets are uniform, and the transitions between them seem smooth and deliberate, which helps maintain the illusion of a crystalline sculpture.",

      "question": "Are the colossal, intricately carved ivory chess rooks structurally consistent with the birds perched on them, avoiding any visual distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chess rooks in Image B, upon which the birds are perched, appear to be large and detailed with fine carving. The bases provide a stable platform for the birds, and there is no indication of visual distortion such as misalignment or disproportion that would disrupt the scene's structural integrity. The size and form work harmoniously with the aesthetic setup of the scene.",

      "question": "Does the surreal library setting with drifting books maintain visual plausibility without introducing any unnatural artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The library setting in Image B is surreal, with flying books that defy gravity, which is a creative and artistic choice rather than an attempt at realism. This setup intentionally breaks the bounds of reality but is consistent within its own fantasy logic. There are no glaring artifacts, such as random blurriness or misplaced objects, indicating that the scene has been well-edited to maintain visual consistency and a thematic sense of wonder.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image as a whole maintain structural coherence and visual credibility, with all elements appearing naturally integrated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an imaginative and fantastical setting with birds made of origami and crystal, set on chess rook bases in a library with flying books. While it is not realistic, the coherence of the elements working together creates a believable imagery scope within its surreal context. The integration appears thoughtful and intended, with no evident jarring transitions between elements that would break the viewer's suspension of disbelief.",
