        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feathers on the headdress are brightly colored and arranged in a circular pattern.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layered necklaces appear to be stacked logically with heavier and larger pieces at the bottom, aligning with gravitational expectations.
