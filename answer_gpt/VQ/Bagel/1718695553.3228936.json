    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the white studio background uniformly flat and free of shadows, texture mismatches, or visible edges where it meets the toy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a smooth white studio background that is commonly used in professional product photography. Such backgrounds are designed to avoid shadows and texture mismatches to achieve a clean, unobstructed view of the item being highlighted. Given these considerations, the background appears uniformly flat with no disturbances where it meets the toy, which is indicative of careful lighting and background setup in studio environments.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the logo tag on the hippo’s ear properly aligned with the knit texture, showing realistic thread stitching and no unnatural color or shape distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo tag on the hippo’s ear aligns well with the knit texture which would be expected to follow the natural form of the ear’s surface in real life. The tag appears to be well integrated with the knit structure, with proper stitching that suggests realism in design. There is no indication of unnatural color or shape distortion, hence it fits seamlessly with the toy’s overall texture.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the circular patch on the hippo’s side have consistent knit texture and thickness with the surrounding fabric, without raised or detached appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular patch seems to maintain the same knit texture and thickness as the rest of the hippo fabric, which generally indicates proper design consistency and manufacturing precision. The patch integration appears smooth and does not show signs of being raised or detached, which aligns with how such patches should appear on knit toys if designed correctly.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the packaging box positioned behind the toy at a natural distance, with consistent lighting and shadow alignment that matches the direction of light on the toy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the visual cues in Image B, the packaging box is positioned behind the toy at a plausible distance and correctly follows the lighting direction evident on the toy. Well-executed product photography will ensure shadows align consistently with the lighting source, creating a harmonious visual composition between the toy and its packaging.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the plastic window on the box front transparent with subtle reflections and no distortion of the toy’s image visible through it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection in Image B, the plastic window on the packaging shows transparency typical of such materials, allowing a clear view of the toy without distorting its appearance. The reflections, if present, are subtle, and the image maintains integrity without visible deformation or warping usually seen in poorly executed packaging designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the text elements clearly visible, correctly spaced, and rendered with smooth edges without jaggedness or overlapping with other objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Text visibility in Image B is enhanced by clear spacing and smooth rendering, which is a standard expected from quality graphic design on packaging. There is no jaggedness or overlapping with other packaging elements, ensuring that the text appears professional and is easy to read, typical of brand standards for marketable products.",
