      "question": "Does the dancer's silhouette retain natural body proportions and smooth contours without distorted limbs or misshapen joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized, illustrative rendering of a dancer. Her silhouette features exaggerated hip and waist curves and elongated limbs, common in animated or cartoon portrayals. These elements create an idealized representation rather than realistic proportions, characterized by smooth, flowing lines and consistent body contours. Thus, the proportions, while not entirely realistic, are intended and consistent within the artistic style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ruffles of the red dress transformed into flame-like swirls with smooth gradients and consistent lighting, avoiding jagged edges or disjointed shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red dress’s ruffles have been artistically interpreted as flame-like swirls. These swirls are vibrant and feature smooth color transitions, reflecting heat and light energy effectively. The design retains cohesive lighting effects and swirling patterns that avoid any harsh or irregular edges, creating an immersive visual effect. The consistent and fluid design matches the fiery theme seamlessly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the golden crescent moon reflection on the ground aligned with the position of the moon in the sky and does it follow realistic light reflection patterns on the tiled surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crescent moon’s reflection on the ground in Image B is visually aligned with its position in the sky, placed directly below it. The light reflection on the tile surface exhibits coherent patterning that matches the highly reflective style of the illustration, emphasizing glowing and fantastical elements instead of strictly realistic reflection behavior.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the starry night sky border blend seamlessly with the main sky background without visible edges, repeated patterns, or unnatural star clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The starry night sky in Image B utilizes an illustrative approach where the stars are scattered in varied densities, creating a whimsical and magical ambiance. The blending of the sky with the surrounding scene is smooth, without noticeable delineations or repetitive patterns. The distribution of stars, while stylized, enhances the background without introducing unnatural clumping or cluster inconsistencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dancer’s raised hand show five clearly defined fingers with natural joint angles and no missing or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer’s raised hand is depicted in a simplified, illustrative fashion typical of animated styles. While the arm and hand are stylized, the hand lacks anatomically realistic detailing, making the fingers less distinct. The hand is rendered in a silhouette form, emphasizing the stylized motion over precision, resulting in less definition of individual digits compared to realistic portrayals.",
