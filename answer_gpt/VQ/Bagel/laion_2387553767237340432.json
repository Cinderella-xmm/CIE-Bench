      "question": "Does the marbled ceramic finish on both vases display consistent, smooth patterns without visible texture breaks or artificial repetitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the marbled ceramic finish on the vase's base shows a natural and consistent pattern with swirling designs typical of high-quality ceramic work. The integration of the colors and patterns appears smooth and unified, suggesting that the finish was applied carefully to avoid repetitive textures or visible breaks. Comparing this with the plain finish visible in Image A, where there was no marbling, confirms that Image B's finish is specific and distinct. The understanding of typical marbled ceramic finishes helps conclude that the patterns should be unique and smooth as presented in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the branding decals applied to the vases clearly visible, proportionally sized, and aligned with the surface curvature without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any branding decals directly applied on the vases; thus, this question may not apply to the edited image as the main focus is on decorative finishes rather than decals. Therefore, concluding based on the image alone, there are no visible branding decals applied to the vases in Image B.",

      "question": "Do the gold leaf accents on the vases show realistic highlights and edge definition consistent with metallic foil applied to curved surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold leaf accents on the vases exhibit realistic characteristics of metallic foil, such as bright highlights where light would naturally reflect off the surface and defined edges that transition into the ceramic material. Such detailing indicates a careful application typical of artistic enhancements, providing a three-dimensional emphasis that complements the curved nature of the vase. Knowledge of gold leaf application offers insight into how light interacts with metallic surfaces, supporting the conclusion of a realistic depiction.",

      "question": "Is the cross-sectional illustration on the packaging box accurately depicting the internal petal arrangement of the vases without geometric mismatch or incorrect layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging box in Image B illustrates the vases on its surface. The depicted arrangement of the petals appears consistent with the design visible on the actual vases, with no discernible geometric mismatches or incorrect layering. The box art reflects the petal configuration accurately as presented on the real items. Understanding vase construction and packaging design principles helps verify that the illustration aligns with the intended design.",

      "question": "Is the bronze typography on the packaging box legible, evenly spaced, and free from blurring or unwanted shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bronze typography on the packaging in Image B is clear and well-defined, with each letter evenly spaced and forming a cohesive and legible word 'Earth Elegance'. There are no traces of blurring or unwanted shadows that could affect readability. Typography here maintains a visually pleasing and professional appearance, which is crucial for branding and readability on commercial products.",

      "question": "Are the two vases still symmetrical and proportionally accurate compared to the original, with no stretched or compressed sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two vases with intricate detailing. While they have been updated with decorative elements like gold leaf and marbling, their overall shapes remain symmetrical and proportionate. Comparing this with the original vases in Image A, the fundamental shape and proportions are preserved despite decorative modifications. Understanding the geometric principles of vases and symmetry verifies that the proportions are consistent and accurate.",
