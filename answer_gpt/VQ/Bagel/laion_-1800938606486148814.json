    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transparent upper material appear smooth and uniform without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent opacity across the shoe's surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent upper material is visible, showcasing a high-tech design with circuit-like patterns. Based on visual observations, the material appears smooth and uniform, without any noticeable pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent opacity. This conclusion is drawn from the fine detail and precision seen in the digital illustrations, implying a high-quality edit as would be expected in a futuristic shoe concept.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the neon blue glow around the Swoosh evenly distributed with smooth transitions and no abrupt color shifts or light leaks into neighboring surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neon blue glow around the Swoosh in Image B is analyzed based on its appearance—glowing uniform blue with no abrupt color transitions or leaks into adjacent areas, suggesting clean and precisely applied digital effects. This aligns with typical expectations for high-quality design work where lighting effects are carefully controlled to enhance visual appeal without disruption.",

      "question": "Is the digital screen on the strap properly aligned with the strap’s curvature, showing clear and stable animation content without pixelation or visual noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital screens on the strap appear precisely aligned with the strap’s curvature, showing animated content clearly without pixelation or visual noise, based on the intricate circuit details and illustrative quality found throughout the edited image. The seamless integration of digital elements on the shoe reflects a skilled editing process aligned with high-tech theme standards.",

      "question": "Does the digital shoe box exhibit consistent geometry and metallic reflection patterns without warped edges or misaligned holographic layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shoe box in Image B shows consistent geometry, with well-defined edges and metallic reflection patterns. There are no visible signs of warped edges or misalignment of holographic layers, which is characteristic of professional digital renderings where geometric consistency and detailed reflections are key to maintaining visual integrity and modern aesthetic appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the shoe box evenly spaced and aligned with the surface contours, without repeating anomalies or misregistration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inspection of the shoe box in Image B reveals geometric patterns that appear evenly spaced and aligned with surface contours, showing no anomalies or misregistration. This outcome is determined by the clean alignment and consistent visual arrangement of details, common in high-quality digital images, especially in designs aiming for futuristic elegance and precision.",
