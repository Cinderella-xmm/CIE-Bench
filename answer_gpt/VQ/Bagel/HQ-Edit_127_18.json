      "question": "Are the boundaries of the vintage travel case visible and seamlessly integrated into the scene without sudden shifts in perspective or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vintage travel case is clearly defined by its rectangular shape with metal clasps and edges. The integration into the scene is judged by the continuity of perspective and lighting. The case forms the base and backdrop for the diorama, and the lighting appears consistent across the scene, providing a seamless look without sudden shifts. Therefore, the boundaries are visible and integrated well.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the textured resin grass show individual blades with natural variation in length and angle, and does it cast soft shadows consistent with the light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass appears to have a consistent texture with blades exhibiting some variation in angle, contributing to a realistic depiction. The lighting in the diorama casts shadows on the surface, which are soft and consistent with the light source from above.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the miniature acacia tree significantly smaller than the elephant and placed at a distance that creates a believable sense of scale within the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the acacia tree is noticeably smaller than the elephant, which fits the miniature scale of the diorama. The placement of the tree creates a believable sense of proportion and depth within the scene, reflecting typical sizes of such elements in miniature models.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the painted clouds located on the inner surface of the lid, showing no specular highlights or depth inconsistencies that would suggest they are floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are painted on the inner lid of the case, contributing to the background scenery. They do not exhibit specular highlights that would suggest they are floating objects; instead, they appear as a flat decoration consistent with the painted scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the brass compass resting flat on the base with a clear reflection and shadow that matches the lighting direction and surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the compass appears to be resting flat on the surface of the case. The light creates reflections consistent with its metallic surface, and shadows are cast according to the light direction and surface texture, showing a realistic integration into the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the elephant retain natural skin texture, correct limb proportions, and intact tusk curvature without any visible deformation or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant model displays distinct skin texture and correct anatomical proportions. The tusks have a smooth curve typical of real elephants, and no visible deformation or pixelation is present, contributing to a lifelike portrayal in the miniature diorama.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all objects in the diorama cast shadows in the same direction and with similar softness, consistent with a single light source from above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects within the diorama, including the elephant and the tree, cast shadows that fall in the same direction. The shadows are soft and consistent, indicating a single light source illuminating the scene from above.",
