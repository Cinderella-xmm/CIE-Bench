      "question": "Is the pelican's beak elongated but still attached naturally to the head without bending or breaking at the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's beak is represented as a simple, elongated object typical of a stylized cartoon representation. It is attached to the head in a seamless manner, characteristic of designs where anatomical correctness is simplified for aesthetic purposes. As such, the beak appears natural in the context of the edited image's style, without bending or breaking at its base.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the pelican’s feathers display visible layered texture despite being colored in pastel shades, without appearing uniformly smooth or pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The feathers in Image B are depicted using simplified shapes and pastel colors typical of cartoon art, where intricate details like layered textures are often not represented. They look smooth and uniform rather than layered or textured, aligning with the artistic style. Thus, they do not display visible layered texture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sailor hat is clearly positioned on top of the pelican's head with no overlap onto the neck or signs of detachment. It complements the cartoon style as a separate element naturally associated with the character's head, proper for cartoon portrayals.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features evenly spaced horizontal wooden planks with consistent grain and lighting typical of an illustrative style. There are no visible seams or inconsistencies, adhering to how objects are commonly depicted as flat and uniform in graphics.",

      "question": "Are the pelican’s legs and feet proportionally aligned with the body and not distorted or bent in an unnatural way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the pelican's legs and feet aligned with its body, common in cartoon art where exaggerated proportions are intentionally avoided for simplicity. The legs are visibly attached in a proportionate manner consistent with the design style, rather than bent unnaturally.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pelican in Image B is drawn in a flat, two-dimensional manner typical of cartoon or magnet designs, featuring minimal depth cues and clean edges. This is consistent with visual designs where depth is less pronounced to focus on clear and distinctive outlines, suitable for flat object representation.",
