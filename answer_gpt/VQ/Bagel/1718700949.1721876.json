      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the elephant have clear, smooth edges without visible artifacts, distortions, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case exhibits clean lines and a smooth finish, which can be an indicator of well-rendered edges. The absence of visual artifacts such as distortions or reflections suggests that the rendering of the glass is seamless and realistic. Glass typically has smooth edges and clarity without distortions in a high-quality image, indicating that these elements are accurately represented here.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the metallic resin details on the elephant’s armor consistently textured and reflective, showing no unnatural glossiness or broken patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant’s armor in Image B is depicted with a textured appearance that is consistent with metallic resin materials, known for their intricate patterns and reflectiveness. The absence of unnatural glossiness is important to maintain realism, as excessive shine could indicate an error in material rendering. The textures appear continuous without broken patterns, which enhances the authenticity of the material design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the silk-gold banners located at the four corners of the glass case, properly anchored, and displaying natural fabric draping and color variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silk-gold banners are positioned at the corners of the glass case and exhibit realistic draping, which suggests a natural fabric flow. The color variation likely represents the way light interacts with silk, highlighting different tones and enhancing the natural appearance. Proper anchoring refers to how the banners are attached or secured within the glass case, which appears convincingly realistic based on their position and draping.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the layered mountain silhouettes in the background show gradual opacity and depth, with no sharp edges or inconsistent transparency levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mountain silhouettes in Image B exhibit a progression in opacity and depth, creating a realistic sense of distance. Gradual changes in transparency levels are key to depicting atmospheric perspective, where objects further away appear lighter and softer. The absence of sharp edges further supports this illusion, as realistic landscapes generally show soft transitions between layers to convey a sense of space.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bonsai-like trees at the foreground edges realistically integrated into the rocky surface, with natural leaf textures and root placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bonsai-like trees are placed at the edges of the glass case and appear to be integrated naturally into the rocky surface. The leaf textures maintain a natural appearance, indicative of realistic detailing. Proper root placement would mean the roots appear grounded within the surface they rest on, without looking artificially placed. These aspects contribute to the realism of the miniature scene depicted.",
