    "Question": "Q1: Are the seat cushion's surfaces composed of clearly defined, uniformly sized LEGO brick layers with smooth gradients between them, maintaining a consistent black color without texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chair's seat cushion is constructed from LEGO bricks. The bricks are clearly defined, and their uniform size is evident due to the distinctive LEGO brick-like bumps on top and the standard brick dimensions. The surface is consistent in black color, supporting the notion that there are no texture artifacts present, but instead, a plastic texture typical of LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the backrest consist of evenly spaced, horizontally aligned LEGO brick layers that follow the original contour without gaps, misalignments, or irregular spacing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the backrest is composed of LEGO bricks stacked horizontally in layers. The bricks are aligned with little to no visible gaps, maintaining an organized, even spacing typical of LEGO constructions, thereby preserving a linear contour.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the armrests rendered as simple hinged LEGO pieces with clean edges and uniform silver finish, preserving their original curvature and connection points without distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the armrests are constructed from LEGO components, resembling hinged pieces commonly seen in LEGO kits. These pieces have clean edges and attempt to mimic the chairâ€™s original curvature. However, they are rendered in a more gray/silver-like color typical to LEGO without visible distortion in their assembly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are all five wheels made of translucent gray material with visible internal structure resembling LEGO wheel design, and do they maintain consistent size and placement under the base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels appear to be transparent (or translucent) pieces typical of some LEGO components. They are placed symmetrically under the chair base, which suggests consistency in size and placement, mimicking a standard arrangement often found in LEGO vehicle models.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the chair positioned on a flat, uninterrupted white tabletop surface that contrasts with the original floor, with no visible shadows or depth inconsistencies suggesting misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chair appears to be placed on a smooth, flat surface, likely a tabletop due to the continuous white color. The lack of any strong shadows or misalignment on the surface suggests a consistent, flat placement, distinguishing it from any textured or varied flooring.",
    "answer": "Yes"
