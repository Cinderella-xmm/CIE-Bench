    "Question": "Q1: Does the entire surface of the LEGO statue display uniform brick textures with no visible patches of residual wood grain or inconsistent material transitions?",
    "explanation": "The statue in Image B is constructed from LEGO pieces, generally characterized by their smooth, consistent surface without the natural variations found in wood or other organic materials. This uniformity is evident across the statue's surface, avoiding grain or material transition issues typical of wood. Thus, the analysis reflects the uniformity typical of LEGO construction materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the detailed carvings on the headdress, chest plate, and belt represented by small, precisely placed LEGO bricks that preserve the original patterns without loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, LEGO bricks substitute the carvings that were detailed in the original wooden statue. However, due to the nature of LEGO pieces, there may be limitations in achieving the same level of intricacy and detail as carvings, which may not be entirely preserved. Typically, the rectilinear nature of LEGO bricks may not capture intricate patterns perfectly.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the arms, legs, and torso of the LEGO statue maintain natural human proportions with correctly scaled joints and limbs?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO statue in Image B is based on the proportions typical of LEGO figures, which tend to be stylized and not reflective of natural human proportions. LEGO figures usually have a blocky structure with exaggerated or minimized elements distinct from human anatomy, such as shorter limbs and a more rigid posture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do both hands of the LEGO statue have five distinct fingers with natural finger positioning and no signs of merging or deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO statue's hands follow the traditional LEGO design, which typically includes a simple clasp shape without individually molded fingers, representing the function over realism characteristic. Consequently, LEGO hands usually lack detail relating to natural finger positioning.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO statue centered on a flat white pedestal with realistic shadows and reflections that align with the lighting direction in the gallery?",
    "explanation": "The pedestal in Image B appropriately supports the LEGO statue, exhibiting features typical of gallery displays. The lighting setup seems consistent with gallery lighting, producing shadows and reflections on the pedestal's surface that align with common lighting arrangements. This suggests a coherent integration into the gallery scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
