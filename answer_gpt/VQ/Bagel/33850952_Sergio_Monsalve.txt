    "Question": "Q1: Are the tentacle-like extensions smoothly integrated into the original curves of the facade without sudden angular breaks or disconnected segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tentacle-like extensions form the main structure of the image, showing a highly detailed, organic-looking form with smooth transitions among the elements. While the image represents a highly stylized creature with intricate tentacles, there is no concept of a building facade to compare in this scenario. The integration appears smooth and well-curated with no visible angular breaks or disconnected segments.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the fibrous textures follow the curvature of the facade and appear continuous without repeating patterns or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a complex fibrous texture along the alien-like entity. The details are intricate, with the fibers conforming smoothly to the overall shape of the entity, giving an appearance of continuity and organic flow, thereby avoiding jagged edges or obvious repetitive patterns.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the window areas replaced with translucent membranes that maintain soft light transmission and lack sharp borders or visible seams?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the areas that could metaphorically represent windows instead show rounded and brightly lit segments on the surface of the entity. These segments resemble luminous spots rather than actual windows. The nature of the glowing segments suggests a smooth blending into the body without defining sharp borders or seams, resembling a more biological transparency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the iridescent scale patterns align with the surface curvature and display smooth color transitions without flat or distorted regions?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases vibrant, iridescent sections with smooth transitions across the entity's curved surface. These glowing areas have a fluidity to the color changes which follow the topological complexity of the object, avoiding any appearance of flatness or distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the bio-luminescent lines emit a soft, uneven glow that fades naturally at the edges and interacts with nearby surfaces?",
    "explanation": "The image features distinct bio-luminescent lines running along the tentacles, which cast a soft and seamless glow. The glow appears to integrate naturally into the surrounding area, suggesting how it might interact with surfaces in close proximity as part of the alien aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all modified elements—tentacles, membranes, textures, and glow lines—properly anchored to the building structure without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while there is no traditional building structure to compare, the elements depicted—such as tentacles and textures—appear to cohesively form a single entity. These elements do not show signs of incorrect floating or overlapping, implying a consistent, integrated design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are balcony railings, interior furniture, and planters still visible and undistorted beneath the added textures and lighting effects?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not display any of the architectural elements present in Image A, such as balcony railings or visible furniture. The image is purely an artistic rendition of an alien-like form, devoid of recognizable urban architecture components.",
    "answer": "No"
