    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the outlines around each rose petal uniform, continuous, and free of pixelation or irregular breaks that would indicate an unnatural transition from organic form to mosaic pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is an artistic mosaic representation of a rose bush. The outlines are made up of tesserae, typical of mosaic art, and by nature, they consist of individual pieces rather than continuous lines. The uniformity and continuity are subject to the mosaic medium. The intent here is to reflect a mosaic style which inherently includes breaks at the grout between pieces. There are no unexpected irregular breaks or pixelation indicative of poor quality transition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the petals exhibit smooth transitions between light and dark areas consistent with pearl-like reflectivity, and do the leaves show subtle jade-like translucency without visible texture distortion or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petals and leaves are depicted using tiles typical for mosaics. The transitions in shading are achieved through the placement of different colored tiles rather than smooth gradations of color. While the arrangement gives the impression of shading, it does not match the smoothness of pearl reflectivity or jade translucency seen in organic forms. The mosaic style inherently involves more abrupt transitions between shades, lacking the effects described, such as translucency or sheen.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the architectural features like the arched window and corner pilasters preserved in shape and proportion despite being converted into terracotta-colored tiles, and do they align seamlessly with adjacent mosaic sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the corner of the building and its architectural features like the pilasters are aesthetically represented with tiles. The structure of these features is preserved in relation to their shape and proportion. The tiled depiction aligns well with the representation of adjacent sections, ensuring continuity of the mosaic art without noticeable misalignment or distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the mosaic rose bush maintain correct spatial placement relative to the building behind it, with no floating or misplaced elements suggesting incorrect depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic rose bush is meticulously depicted in front of the building, consistent with its likely real-world position. There are no elements in the mosaic that appear to be floating or incorrectly placed, ensuring that the depth perception relative to the building is maintained accurately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details such as petal layers, leaf venation, and brick joints preserved in a stylized yet coherent manner, without appearing smeared, distorted, or replaced by flat, featureless surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a mosaic tile style to represent the object details. While the petal layers and leaf venation are represented in a stylized form using tiles, they are coherent and show intention in design. Brick joints are represented in a unique mosaic style rather than true-to-life details. These stylistic choices purposefully simplify the details which might appear flat but maintain the artwork's integrity.",
