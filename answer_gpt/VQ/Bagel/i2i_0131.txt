    "Question": "Q1: Do the refrigerator doors and handles appear proportionally correct and geometrically consistent with typical refrigerator designs?",
    "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the refrigerator doors are tall with long vertical handles, which is a common design for side-by-side refrigerators. The proportions and geometry seem typical for such appliances, matching expected dimensions without any notable inconsistencies. The handles align vertically along the edge of the doors, reinforcing the conventional design. This suggests consistency and correctness in the design proportion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the metallic surfaces of the refrigerator free from unnatural textures, maintaining a consistent and authentic finish throughout?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic surfaces exhibit a smooth, uniform finish typical of stainless steel, which is commonly used in refrigerator design. The surfaces have a matte sheen without any distracting textures or patterns, which suggests an authentic metallic finish. The visual presentation continuously aligns with what can be expected of high-quality refrigerator surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the lighting appear uniform across both refrigerators, without noticeable shadows or highlights that disrupt the natural appearance?",
    "explanation": "Image B reveals a consistent lighting source that illuminates the refrigerators uniformly, with no stark shadows or overly bright highlights. The lighting seems to be diffused across the surfaces evenly, ensuring a coherent and natural appearance that matches typical indoor lighting environments.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Are there smooth transitions where the refrigerators meet the cabinets, without visible seams or edges that break the visual continuity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the refrigerators are standalone and do not have cabinets surrounding them, unlike Image A where they are integrated into a kitchen setting. Therefore, there are no seams or transitions between refrigerators and cabinets to assess in the edited image. The design is consistent and seamless in terms of standing against a wall or open space.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Are the water dispensers on both refrigerators clearly defined and positioned appropriately, contributing to the overall realism?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the water dispensers positioned on the left side of each refrigerator door, a typical placement for this feature. The dispensers are integrated into the doors with control panels above them, providing a realistic appearance consistent with modern refrigerator design. The definition and positioning of these elements reinforce the overall authenticity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
