    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the arms and legs of the figure have clearly defined joints and correct proportions, with no missing or extra limbs, and do the hands each have exactly five fingers arranged naturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is a doll, and the visible joints may not be as defined as those of a human figure. Generally, dolls have correct proportions but simplified joint structures. The arms and legs appear to have standard doll proportions, but the hands reveal only simple hand shapes with no detailed fingers, typical of doll design. Dolls often have a fixed number of fingers that align with human anatomy, but this doll does not showcase detailed finger articulation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the pattern on the jacket and the stitching on the skirt preserved and aligned correctly, with no distorted or repeated textures, and does the fabric drape naturally over the doll's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the jacket are floral and appear evenly distributed, and the stitching on the skirt looks regular, without distortion or repeated textures, suggesting the textile is aligned properly. The jacket and skirt drape over the doll's form naturally as expected in doll clothing, with fabric following the contours appropriately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lace trim around the collar thin and evenly applied, with no visible gaps, misalignment, or unnatural shadows indicating poor integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lace trim around the collar appears delicate and evenly applied, without identifiable gaps or misalignment. Given the uniformity and symmetry visible, there are also no unnatural shadows that would suggest integration issues; it appears seamlessly attached to the garment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the velvet hat properly sized relative to the head, with visible fabric texture and soft shadows that suggest it is resting on the head rather than floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The velvet hat in Image B seems proportionally accurate for the doll's head and features visible fabric texture. Soft shadows around the hat suggest that it is resting appropriately on the doll's head, achieving a realistic effect without appearing to float.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cobblestone ground, gas lamps, and horse-drawn carriages in the background proportionally smaller than the doll and rendered with consistent textures and lighting that match the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cobblestone ground, gas lamps, and horse-drawn carriages are scaled appropriately smaller than the doll, consistent with the perspective where the doll is the main subject in the foreground. The textures and lighting are uniform and harmonious, maintaining the realistic aspect of the scene composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the face have simplified features typical of a doll (such as painted eyes and smooth skin), and do the limbs show clear joint lines or hinges without unnatural bending or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face in Image B has simplified features characteristic of dolls, likely painted eyes and smooth skin surfaces. The limbs exhibit areas resembling joint lines or hinges typical of dolls, providing structural articulation without unnatural bending or stretching. These aspects are coherent with doll design.",
