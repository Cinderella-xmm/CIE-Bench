      "question": "Does the creature added to the image appear naturally integrated with the temple and surrounding jungle, without any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is depicted in a stylized, cartoonish manner in front of a temple structure. The illustration style differs significantly from the photographic quality of the jungle and temple in Image A. The character's textures and colors do not naturally integrate with the organic, detailed look of the original landscape. The bright green with patterned texture clashes with the realistic details of the surrounding environment, highlighting a lack of integration and presenting a more stylized, fantasy element rather than a natural one.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the creature's design reflect the temple's shape and textures accurately, maintaining structural coherence and avoiding distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B is designed with stylized textures that mimic foliage or leaf patterns, while the temple is depicted as detailed stone architecture. While there is an attempt to reflect the natural environment through the creature's green color and plant-like pattern, the creature's form is distinctly rounded and animated, contrasting with the sharp and angular structure of the temple, thus lacking structural coherence with the temple's architecture.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the custom-designed orb or capsule at the creature's feet visually consistent with the temple's architectural details and natural elements, without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orb at the creature's feet in Image B is designed with bold colors and distinct patterns that do not resemble the temple's stone textures or the jungle's natural elements. Its design is more akin to a playful, fantasy item rather than an archaeological or natural element. The stark difference in style and color indicates an inconsistency with the detailed natural and architectural elements in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the addition of the creature and the custom-designed orb maintain the scene's overall authenticity and natural appearance, without disrupting the harmony of the jungle and temple setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brightly colored creature and the orb present a contrast to the realistic depiction of the landscape; they introduce a whimsical, animated style into the scene. This stark contrast disrupts the scene's authenticity and natural appearance, as the additions are distinctively cartoonish and do not blend seamlessly with the temple and jungle setting.",

      "question": "Are the creature's invented name and elemental type displayed clearly beside or beneath it, without interfering with the visual quality or introducing any distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The invented name 'JIAYIRD' and elemental type are displayed below the creature in a stylized font. This text is separate from the creature illustration and does not interfere with the visual quality of the main elements, as it is confined to a specific area of the image. The addition of this text does not introduce distracting elements that detract from the overall scene.",
