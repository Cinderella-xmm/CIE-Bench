        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suitcases have cartoonish facial features such as eyes and mouths that fit within the confines of the suitcase surfaces. This approach maintains the shape of each suitcase without causing any obvious distortions or protrusion that would disrupt their geometry.",
