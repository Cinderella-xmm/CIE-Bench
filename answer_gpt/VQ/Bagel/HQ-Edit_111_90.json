      "question": "Are the metal filigree patterns and gemstone placements on the transformed necklace clearly defined and free from geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the necklace features intricate metal filigree and green gemstones, and upon inspection, they appear to maintain consistent design symmetry without visible distortion. The filigree patterns look well-defined with detailed craftsmanship, which ensures there is no geometric distortion affecting the design. The gemstones are placed symmetrically in a similar fashion as seen in ornamental jewelry designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the snake tail maintain its original scaly texture and smooth curvature as it emerges from the mossy bank without sudden breaks or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image displays a snake with its tail emerging from a mossy bank. Its texture shows detailed scales that are evenly arranged, and the tail displays a smooth and natural curve. There are no signs of abrupt angles or breaks, which indicates a realistic representation consistent with a snake's physical characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass dome visually transparent with consistent reflections and refractions across its surface, showing no jagged edges or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears transparent, and when examining the reflections and refractions, they are smooth and consistent across its surface. The edges are clean and well-defined, showing no signs of jaggedness or digital artifacts that would disrupt the visual coherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the emerald pond display natural water surface details such as subtle ripples and reflections, and are the silver leaves evenly shaped with consistent metallic highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pond in Image B has a surface that exhibits subtle ripples, typical of natural water surface detail, along with reflections that mimic real water behavior. The silver leaves are well-proportioned, showing a uniform shape and metallic highlights, which gives them a realistic appearance without any inconsistencies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the ornate branches supporting the chandelier proportionally sized and shaped to resemble natural plant structures without angular breaks or unnatural joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branches in Image B that hold the chandelier are shaped to convey natural plant-like structures. They demonstrate proportional size and have smooth curves, without any angular breaks or unnatural joints. This contributes to their realistic representation as supporting structures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the new elements (pond, leaves, branches, dome) properly overlap and interact with the original necklace and snake tail without floating disjointedly or violating depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The integration of new elements such as the pond, leaves, branches, and dome in Image B is seamless with the original necklace and snake tail, showing natural depth and interaction. These elements overlap in a manner consistent with real-life spatial relationships, without appearing disjointed or violating depth cues.",
