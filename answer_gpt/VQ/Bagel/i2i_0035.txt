    "Question": "Q1: Are the colors of the salad, milk carton, chicken parmesan, and oranges enhanced in a way that appears natural and free from obvious artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the food items and milk carton have enhanced colors that are vibrant and visually distinct. However, the colors do not appear over-saturated or unnatural. The salad looks fresh with varied greens, the cheese on the chicken parmesan is a suitable yellowish-white, and the orange slices are vivid but realistic in hue. There are no apparent artifacts that suggest a poor enhancement of colors. Thus, the enhancement appears natural.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the added title \"Today’s Balanced Lunch\" blend naturally into the image without breaking the structural consistency or introducing any distorted elements?",
    "explanation": "The text 'Today’s Balndned Lunch' in Image B appears to have a typographical error ('Balndned' instead of 'Balanced'), which is inconsistent with the intended message. Additionally, the text layout, while aligned, does not exhibit smooth integration due to this error and potentially due to visual distortion around the letters.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the white outlines applied to the edges of the plate, food items, and text enhance the visual clarity without creating unnatural textures or degrading fine details?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is an evident outline effect that exaggerates the edges of items and text. This effect introduces a cartoonish style that distorts fine details, such as the cheese and textures of the salad. This results in unnatural textures that deviate from realistic presentation.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the placeholder for the school logo placed at the bottom right corner with appropriate size and proportion, ensuring it fits naturally within the layout without disrupting the overall balance of the image?",
    "explanation": "The placeholder for the school logo at the bottom right corner of Image B appears disproportionate—it is relatively small and the text within it is not clear. However, it is placed in a position that does not disrupt the layout, albeit not blending seamlessly with the overall composition due to size or clarity.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the image been resized and formatted for an A4 vertical layout in a manner that preserves the natural proportions and structural consistency of the plate, food items, and text elements?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a vertical orientation typical of an A4 format, which encompasses text and image elements in a structured manner. However, the stretching or distortion of the text and image components, such as the milk carton appearing slanted, suggests inconsistencies in maintaining natural proportions. This affects the overall structural consistency.",
    "answer": "No"
