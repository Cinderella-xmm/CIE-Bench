    "Question": "Q1: Are the upper and lower tiers clearly defined with consistent perspective and proportional scaling, and is there a visible separation between them that suggests a layered structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe features two distinct sections: an upper tier with a cityscape and a lower tier with two Eiffel Towers and trees. The globe design inherently separates these layers, with the upper tier appearing to float above the lower tier, suggesting a clear and intentional layered structure. The perspective and scale are consistent as they fit within the expected proportions of a miniaturized globe scene, aiding in visually distinguishing depth and separation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the buildings in the upper tier have a metallic sheen with subtle reflections and gradients that match the lighting direction, and are there no flat or unnaturally uniform color patches?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the upper tier depicts a cityscape with buildings that seem to have a metallic-like sheen. This effect is achieved through use of reflections and gradients that align with an implied light source, creating a realistic look. The coloring maintains variation and depth, avoiding flat or unnatural uniformity, which would appear atypical for a representation intended to mimic a real cityscape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the trees and bushes in the lower tier composed of irregular, naturally shaped forms with varying heights and densities, and do they lack repeating texture tiles or unnatural symmetry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trees in the lower tier appear to be miniaturized models typical of those found in snow globes. They exhibit natural variations in shape and density, replicating a more realistic appearance and avoiding the pitfalls of obvious texture tiling or symmetry. Such representation mimics natural growth patterns, which do not follow strict symmetry.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the silvery flakes distributed across the space between tiers with soft edges, slight blurring, and depth-based opacity, indicating movement through air?",
    "explanation": "The snowflakes in Image B are distributed throughout the space between the tiers, with an appearance of blurring and varying opacity. This creates a sense of depth and motion within the snow globe, as the flakes seem to float through an air-like medium. These visual characteristics simulate the typical falling and swirling motion found in snow globes, enhancing their representation of movement through air.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the base show individually rendered cobblestones with visible grout lines and surface variations, and are the street lamps proportionally sized and evenly spaced along the path?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the snow globe reveals cobblestones that are individually detailed with visible grout lines, which contribute to a tactile appearance. However, no street lamps are present in Image B. The evaluation of lamp spacing and size does not apply here as it does not match the given criteria.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are both Eiffel Towers structurally intact with correct lattice patterns, uniform scaling, and no stretched or compressed sections that deviate from their known design?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the Eiffel Towers are depicted as miniaturized models within a snow globe. They maintain the correct lattice patterns typical of the real Eiffel Tower and appear structurally intact, without any disproportionate stretching or compressing. The uniform scaling applied ensures they remain true to their iconic design despite their reduced size. Their representation, though smaller, respects the original architecture's design elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
