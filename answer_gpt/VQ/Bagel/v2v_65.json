      "question": "Does the character's 3D chibi appearance maintain structural consistency and visual credibility without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a chibi style, which is a common artistic style featuring exaggerated features while maintaining structural consistency. The proportions in the chibi style typically include a larger head and smaller body, which is consistent with the character's depiction in Image B. The 3D rendering appears smooth, with no visible distortions or artifacts that suggest inconsistency. The transition between different parts of the body and clothing appears natural and well-blended.",

      "question": "Are the tiny evergreen trees and miniature mountain peaks inside the snow globe depicted with natural textures and shapes, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the snow globe in Image B, the evergreen trees and mountain peaks are clearly rendered with an attention to detail that captures their natural textures. The shapes are consistent with traditional representations of these elements in a miniaturized, stylized form. The textures appear to be well-executed with a smooth finish, and there are no visible artifacts or distortions that break the realism within the context of a stylized snow globe setting.",

      "question": "Do the icy reflections and gentle sparkles created by the soft daylight filtering through the frosty window appear natural and free from unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting effects such as reflections and sparkles are essential in creating a realistic and captivating image. The daylight filtering through the window creates a soft illumination that casts natural-looking reflections and highlights in the snow globe. These visual effects enhance the winter scene's realism without introducing any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies that could detract from the overall appearance.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe resting atop a stone pedestal near a frosty window integrate seamlessly with the snowy mountain range outside, maintaining visual plausibility without any obvious distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the snow globe on a stone pedestal next to a frosty window, allowing a view of the snowy mountains beyond. The scene is cohesive, with elements like the pedestal and snow globe visually harmonizing with the background. The positioning and lighting ensure no visible distortions are present, and the external snowy landscape complements the internal scene, maintaining the overall visual plausibility of the setup.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the character's shield and sword retain their proper shapes and proportions within the 3D chibi style, avoiding any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character inside the snow globe in Image B holds a shield and sword designed to match the chibi artistic style, which means some exaggeration to fit the style's features. Despite this, the shield and sword remain true to expected shapes and proportions for such renderings, appearing balanced and without any unnatural distortions that deviate from typical chibi representations.",
