      "question": "Does the central green block retain its original geometric shape after being converted into a 3D chibi-style cartoon character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central green block is held by a chibi-style character, indicating the block's transformation from a simple rectangular geometric shape into a more stylized, character-like form. This transformation aligns with the intent to create a cartoonish character rather than retaining the original geometric shape as seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the red blocks redesigned as lively supporting characters free from unnatural textures and maintain their original structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red blocks have been transformed into lively chibi-style characters with faces and hearts, indicating that they no longer maintain their original structural integrity. They have been redesigned to fit a new aesthetic, suggesting that their textures and structures are intentionally altered to fit the cartoonish style.",

      "question": "Does the transformed background with soft pastel colors blend naturally with the foreground elements without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of soft pastel colors with heart shapes, which complement the stylistic theme of the cartoonish scene. This indicates a successful blending with the chibi-style characters and blocks in the foreground, without any apparent artifacts or inconsistencies.",

      "question": "Are the heart-shaped confetti elements evenly distributed and visually plausible without causing any loss of detail in the surrounding blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows heart-shaped confetti elements distributed across the scene. They are placed in a manner that appears visually coherent with the overall theme, even though the heart shapes obscure some areas, there is no significant detail loss in the chibi characters or blocks since they remain visible and distinct.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the red and green blocks have been transformed into elements of a chibi aesthetic, with faces and characteristic features fitting the cartoonish theme set in the image. There are no apparent inconsistencies in the style or texture, as all elements maintain a cohesive look that aligns with the chibi style.",
