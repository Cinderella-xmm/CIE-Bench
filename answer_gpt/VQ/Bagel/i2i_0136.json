      "question": "Does the orange retain a realistic glossy texture without unnatural or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the orange resembles a plastic object rather than a real fruit. The surface of the rubber keychain shows a smooth, engineered appearance with repeated patterns, common in molded plastic toys or accessories. The sheen is uniform, resembling the gloss typically found on plastic, rather than the varied, natural gloss of a real orange. This indicates an artificial manufacture rather than natural fruit texture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the stem of the orange well-integrated into the rubber keychain design, maintaining a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stem in Image B is distinct in its color and style, appearing as a separate piece of plastic attached to the top of the object. The design is typical of a toy or novelty item with stylized features. The integration is more functional for aesthetics rather than realism, thus not maintaining a natural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions and shape of the keychain maintain a believable keychain structure, avoiding any distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in Image B is proportionally designed to resemble a small, spherical object that comfortably fits within the scale of a keychain. Its geometric simplicity contributes to a believable design consistent with keychain accessories, with no signs of distortion or disproportion.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the color of the orange keychain accurately reflect a citrus hue, contributing to the authenticity and visual credibility of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color of the keychain is a bright, uniform yellow-orange. This color, while vibrant, is more exaggerated than the natural hue of a citrus fruit. The keychain's color points towards a stylized representation rather than an authentic likeness.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition between the rubber keychain material and the orange's surface seamless, contributing to overall visual coherence and plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in Image B lacks a natural or seamless transition between material surfaces due to its molded plastic nature. The uniform and stylized design prioritizes durability and clear aesthetic segments rather than blending different textures. Thus, the transition is not seamless, contributing to a distinct, manufactured appearance.",
