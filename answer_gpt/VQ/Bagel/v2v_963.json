      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the campfire is illustrated with a central flame and logs surrounding it, resembling the typical structure of a campfire.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figures are stylized but consistent with the proportions typical of chibi characters: larger heads compared to their bodies, small limbs, and simplistic facial features. There are no visible distortions or deformed features in these figures. This aligns with common design practices for chibi figures. Without comparing Image A directly, these proportions appear normal within the genre.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figures are positioned facing the campfire, each holding a sausage, which is a typical activity at a campfire gathering. This arrangement, combined with the warm glow of the fire and cozy setting within the chest, effectively captures the essence of a joyful camping moment. The composition is harmonized, enhancing the scene's credibility without considering Image A.",
