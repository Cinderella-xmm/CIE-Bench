    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges of the rooflines, gables, and timber framing sharply defined and angular without rounded or blurred transitions that contradict the paper-cut style?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the style resembles a paper-cut art with distinct, angular lines forming the rooflines, gables, and timber framing. The visual cues suggest a precise cutting technique, typical of paper art designs, which does not show any rounded or blurred transitions. World knowledge about paper-cut art indicates that its characteristics usually involve sharp and clean lines, aligning with these observations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
