    "Question": "Q1: Does the crystal vase maintain the original shape and proportions of the ceramic vase, with clear faceted surfaces that follow the curvature without geometric distortion?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a crystal vase that is distinctively different from the ceramic vase in Image A. The ceramic vase has a traditional rounded shape with detailed figurine and floral patterns, whereas the crystal vase in Image B features a modern design and faceted surfaces prominently different in design and proportions. The geometric style of the crystal vase notably diverges from the curves and ornamentation of the ceramic vase, indicating a change rather than retention.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the abstract floral patterns on the crystal vase etched into the surface with uniform depth and clarity, without appearing superimposed or blurred?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows patterns etched into the crystal vase with a seemingly uniform depth and clarity. The floral design appears as part of the surface of the vase itself, presenting a clean and precise etching that is typical in crafted crystal pieces. This precision contrasts with the painted patterns on the ceramic vase in Image A, involving a different method and material. The etched nature of the crystal does not indicate any superimposition or blur, suggesting a consistent craftsmanship.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Do the crystal flowers retain the recognizable shapes of the original blooms and display internal refraction and pastel coloration without appearing solid or opaque?",
    "explanation": "Image B reveals crystal flowers that substantially differ from the original blooms in Image A. The blooms in the ceramic vase are varied and naturalistic, including daisies and other flowers, whereas the crystal representation transforms these into abstract geometric forms with internal refraction, appearing in pastel shades. This transformation indicates a reinterpretation rather than retention of the original shapes, showcasing transparency rather than solid opacity.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the mirrored pedestal flat and reflective, showing a clear, undistorted reflection of the crystal vase and flowers?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a mirrored pedestal that is depicted as flat and reflective, indicating it accurately displays a clear reflection of the crystal vase and flowers. The reflection shown does not seem distorted, suggesting high clarity and an undistorted reflection, consistent with common characteristics of properly designed mirror surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the lighting show realistic refraction and internal glow in the crystal elements, with soft highlights and no unnatural bright spots or flat shading?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in Image B indeed shows a sophisticated handling of refraction and internal glow characteristic of crystal objects. The presence of soft highlights and the nuanced pastel shading of the crystal flowers suggests detailed attention to lighting effects, avoiding unnatural bright spots or flat shading. This approach enhances the perception of depth and realism, aligning with expectations for high-quality crystal representations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
