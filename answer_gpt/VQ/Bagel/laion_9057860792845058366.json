    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the reflections on the robot’s body uniform and physically consistent with a metallic surface, without streaks, over-saturation, or mismatched highlight areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot has a metallic appearance with reflections that are consistent with a smooth surface, indicating a high level of polish typical of metal. Highlights appear to be well-managed across the surface, without evidence of over-saturation, which would produce unnatural brightness. Visual observations suggest that reflections are uniform, contributing to a realistic metallic effect.",

      "question": "Is the holographic display on the chest transparent and layered above the surface without warping or clipping into the surrounding armor plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic display on the robot's chest in Image B presents a clear and distinct visual effect where the displayed image seems to float above the armor plate surface without distortion, warping, or clipping. Such visualization is consistent with common depictions of holography, where the image appears layered above the physical surface, enhancing the spatial perception.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the control icons in the digital interface overlay sharp, readable, and positioned without overlapping key mechanical components such as the shoulders or torso joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the icons integrated into the digital interface overlay are crisp and situated with precision, ensuring readability without interference from mechanical parts. Their placement avoids key components like shoulders or joints, maintaining clarity and usability without overlapping or impact from structural elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the smartwatch accessory attached to the forearm without bending or deforming the arm’s structure, and does it have a clean, seamless connection point consistent with magnetic attachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible smartwatch accessory on the forearm in Image B, thus the question does not apply to the presented image. Since no accessory is evidenced, considerations regarding bending, deformation, or attachment are not observable.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the floating tech interface symbols in the background evenly spaced, sharp-edged, and free from jagged outlines or ghosting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floating tech symbols in Image B are displayed with attention to detail, showcasing sharp edges and clear designs without jagged outlines or ghosting effects. Their spacing appears deliberate and well-organized, which maintains a visually appealing and professional appearance typical in tech interfaces.",
