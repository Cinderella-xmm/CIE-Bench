      "question": "Do the feathered wing extensions on the sides of the door maintain consistent wood grain and carving depth, with smooth transitions from the original panel edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an imaginative design where feathered wing extensions appear on the sides of the door. These wings are depicted with vibrant colors and intricate details that differ from the original wood, demonstrating a fantastical change rather than a smooth transition from wood grain carving depth found in Image A. Therefore, despite their artistic appeal, the extensions do not reflect a continuation of the original woods.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the shimmering eyes formed from the iron studs aligned with their original positions and embedded within the wood without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the door has been transformed into a creature with shimmering eyes that were not present in Image A. The eyes are placed in a new position and appear to be added features that diverge from the traditional iron studs pattern seen in Image A. Given that these eyes are a new artistic addition, they float above the surface rather than being directly embedded in alignment with original stud positions.",

      "question": "Does the celestial crown emerging from the arch maintain continuous curvature and seamless integration with the original arch shape, without broken lines or floating pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a celestial crown emerging from the top of the door. The crown's spikes and design present a distinct change from the original arch shown in Image A. This fantastical addition introduces new elements that disrupt the continuity of the arch's curvature, especially with floating spikes that do not integrate seamlessly with the original arch design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the etched runes visible across the doorâ€™s surface consistent in depth, color, and lighting with the original carvings, and do they not cover or distort existing patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features etched runes across the door's surface, which are stylistically different from the intricate traditional carvings seen in Image A. The runes introduce new patterns that overlay the previous carvings, showing different depths and color schemes rather than preserving the traditional consistency.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cloak-like structure around the doorframe exhibit natural fabric folds with consistent lighting and shadow, and does it maintain connection to the original stone frame without gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a cloak-like structure surrounding the door, which appears to be a magical and artistic addition. While it shows detailed fabric folds and lighting effects, this addition significantly alters the original stone frame's appearance from Image A, creating a gap between the fabric and the stone without maintaining its structural integrity.",
