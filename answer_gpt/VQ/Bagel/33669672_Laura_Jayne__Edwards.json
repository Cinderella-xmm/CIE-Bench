    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the limbs proportionally elongated without visible kinks, unnatural bends, or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs appear smoothly elongated without any visible kinks or unnatural bends. The joints are logically placed, maintaining a human-like form, and there are no segments that appear disconnected. The fluidity and continuous form relate well to stylized sculptures, showcasing artistic elongation without anatomical errors.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the boots and leg areas uniformly applied with clean edges and no overlapping or fragmented sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boots and leg areas display geometric patterns that are uniformly applied. The edges are clean, and there are no visible overlaps or fragmented sections. The design is consistent with a stylized aesthetic, using clear, uninterrupted lines that enhance the figure's outline harmoniously.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all body parts, including the skin, dress, and boots, display a consistent metallic sheen with smooth gradients and no patches of mismatched material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all parts of the body, including the skin, dress, and boots, exhibit a consistent metallic sheen. The transitions between different areas have smooth gradients, and there are no mismatched material patches. The entire figure gives a cohesive and shiny appearance consistent with a metallic sculpture interpretation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the color palette limited to metallic tones and turquoise, with no unexpected color bleed or desaturation in the figure or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B is predominantly metallic with a background that complements it with a turquoise hue. There are no unexpected color bleeds or desaturation issues present in either the figure or the background. The colors are well controlled, emphasizing the metallic aesthetic against the turquoise background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the figure's pose maintain natural weight distribution and joint angles, with no floating limbs or unnatural overlaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure maintains a pose that suggests natural weight distribution and logical joint angles. The limbs are elegantly positioned without appearing to float unnaturally or overlap in ways that defy anatomical norms. The figure mirrors a balanced and deliberate choreographed stance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the extended hand have exactly five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, without extra digits or fused joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand in Image B has five distinct fingers, each spaced naturally and with curvature that mimics a realistic hand gesture. There are no extra digits or features suggesting fused joints, conforming to the standard anatomical hand structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
