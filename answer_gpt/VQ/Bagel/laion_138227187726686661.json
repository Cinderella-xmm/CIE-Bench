      "question": "Does the quilt display uniform square blocks with visible grid lines and a matte finish consistent with LEGO bricks, without any fabric-like folds or stitching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt is constructed from LEGO bricks, creating a pattern of colorful interlocking squares. The LEGO construction has visible edges and separations between blocks, consistent with the design of LEGO bricks, which have a matte finish and uniform size. In comparison, a traditional quilt would have fabric, stitching, and folds, which are absent in Image B's design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the round sports elements (e.g., football, soccer ball) represented as circular LEGO tiles with consistent size and alignment within the square grid, without stretching or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible sports elements such as footballs or soccer balls represented within the LEGO brick design. The bricks create a generic pattern without recognizable images or stylized objects like those seen in sports themed quilts. As such, it does not depict circular tiles in alignment with a square grid.",

      "question": "Is the pillow replaced by a cube composed of stacked LEGO bricks with equal dimensions on all sides, right angles, and no visible gaps or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pillow region is constructed using stacked LEGO bricks forming a cuboid with visually equal dimensions, right angles, and consistent alignment with the visible studs, displaying no gaps or misalignments. The surface is smooth, and the edges are sharply defined by the geometry of the bricks, consistent with LEGO design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bed base a flat, white, seamless surface with no visible wood grain, shadows, or depth cues, resembling a standard LEGO baseplate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bed base in Image B is depicted as a flat, white surface typical of a LEGO baseplate. It lacks any wood grain texture, shadows, and depth cues that would be present if it were made from traditional materials like wood. It appears uniform and seamless, matching the characteristics of a LEGO baseplate used for stability and construction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire background a smooth, uniform white surface with no visible walls, furniture, or windows, and are there no shadows or lighting gradients indicating a physical space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is entirely white, without any indications of walls, windows, or any furniture. It is devoid of shadows or light gradients that typically define physical spaces in interior settings. This suggests a studio-style setting where the LEGO bed is isolated against a plain, uniform backdrop.",
