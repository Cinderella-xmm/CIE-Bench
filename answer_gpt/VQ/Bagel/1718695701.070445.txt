    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features such as the nose, mouth, and whiskers preserved in shape and position after conversion to bronze, without visible distortion or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the key region of the blurred face does not show the intricate detailing that could reveal features such as nose, mouth, or whiskers. From world knowledge, when objects are converted to bronze sculptures, the minutiae can be captured finely depending on the artist's work; however, since the face is blurred in Image B, it does not provide any visible evidence of preservation of features without distortion or loss of detail.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the bronze helmet properly scaled and positioned on the head, with smooth transitions at the edges and no visible gaps or misalignments with the skull?",
    "explanation": "The bronze helmet in Image B appears to be well-scaled as it symmetrically covers the top of the blurred face structure, transitioning smoothly from helmet to head region. World knowledge in sculpture crafting implies that properly fitted helmets usually avoid visible gaps if the scaling is done appropriately. However, due to the blurred center, it's unclear if misalignments are present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the bronze-framed glasses sit correctly over the eyes without shifting or overlapping incorrectly, and do the lenses show realistic glass-like reflection and transparency?",
    "explanation": "The blurred area in Image B doesn't display the positioning of glasses over the eyes clearly due to distortion. Typically, glasses aligned correctly should have symmetric placement on the nose bridge and align vertically with the eye line, displaying reflections similar to glass lenses. In the current state, without distinct features visible through the blur, it is impossible to ascertain correctness in positioning or reflective quality.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the bronze sweater maintain the original shape and shoulder strap placement, with engraved lines that follow the contours of the garment without breaking or appearing artificial?",
    "explanation": "The sweater in Image B retains its recognizably curved and textured form, as seen from engravings throughout the visible parts. World knowledge suggests that bronzed objects often preserve structural integrity when designed carefully, maintaining stability in shape and line engravings.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the marble base positioned directly beneath the sculpture, with appropriate contact points and no visible gap between the feet and the base, and is it proportionally sized to support the figure?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a bronze structure set on a marble base. The marble base appears solidly positioned underneath the sculpture, showing no visible gaps at the contact point where they meet. When sculptures are displayed on bases, proportional adequacy is key to avoid toppling, and the visible structure here appears proportionately supported.",
    "answer": "Yes"
