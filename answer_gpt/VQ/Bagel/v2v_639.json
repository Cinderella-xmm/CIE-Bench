        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The minifigures in Image B are made to resemble LEGO toys. Generally, LEGO toys have smooth surfaces, precise details, and consistent color schemes which aid in maintaining structural coherence. The minifigures appear well-crafted without evident distortions or irregular surface finishes, indicating that they are free from unnatural textures and maintain the intended coherence.",
