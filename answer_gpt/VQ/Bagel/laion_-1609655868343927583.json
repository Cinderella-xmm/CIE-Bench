    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the gemstone inlays embedded into the crown surface without visible gaps or floating elements, and does the crown retain the original curvature of the marble top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crown features gemstone inlays that appear well-integrated into the crown surface without visible gaps or floating elements. The crown itself takes inspiration from royal headwear, deviating significantly from the original marble top's shape and curvature seen in Image A. The understanding stems from recognizing design principles where jewelry or adornments are typically embedded directly onto surfaces to ensure a cohesive look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the robe follow the original cabinet’s curved sides and tapering shape, and do the fabric folds and patterns flow naturally without sharp breaks or artificial lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a robe on the character that has a decorative pattern akin to that on the cabinet in Image A, but it is tailored to fit the rounded, more humanoid structure of the character, distinct from the tapering shape of the cabinet. This involves an understanding of clothing design where garments are shaped to the contours of a body, leading to natural folds without sharp breaks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the drawer engravings positioned at the waistline as belt buckles, aligned with the robe’s structure, and connected with visible straps or fastenings that appear physically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the engravings from the cabinet drawers are indeed adapted as belt buckles, integrated into the character's attire in a manner that aligns them with the waistline. They connect with the surrounding motifs and fabric design in a manner that appears functional and plausible, akin to how clothing often features buckles attached to belts through straps.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the clawed feet maintain the original leg length and thickness, and are the claws proportionally sized and fully touching the ground without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's feet are depicted with large claws that seem proportionally significant for a stylized chibi character. While they do touch the ground, their size and design deviate from the original legs in Image A, which are longer and thinner, rooted in typical furniture proportions. This requires an understanding of stylization where such features are exaggerated in character designs.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the drawer openings transformed into pouches with visible flap closures and stitching, and do they hang from the robe with realistic weight and attachment points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any indications of pouches with flap closures or stitching hanging from the robe. Instead, the transformation focuses on utilizing features from Image A in imaginative ways, such as integrating the decorative patterns into the character's attire rather than converting the drawer structure into hanging elements.",
