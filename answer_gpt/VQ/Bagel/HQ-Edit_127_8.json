      "question": "Are the stone towers, archway, and knight proportionally scaled and positioned correctly within the glass orb without geometric distortion or unnatural perspective shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the stone textures on the towers and gate retain fine detail and natural variation after being minified, without appearing overly smooth or pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone textures on the towers and gate are observed to retain a high level of detail, preserving the rugged and natural variations typical of stone surfaces. Despite being minified, the texture does not appear smooth or pixelated, indicating careful attention to detail in preserving the tactile and visual characteristics of stone.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the antique bronze finish applied uniformly to the knight’s armor and the gate, with realistic tarnish, reflections, and surface depth that match physical metal properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the antique bronze finish appears consistently across the knight’s armor and the gate. The finish includes realistic tarnish, providing subtle variations that give a lifelike appearance matching the physical properties of aged metal. Additionally, the reflections and surface depth contribute to a convincing portrayal of bronze.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the heraldic flags positioned correctly on the battlements, with natural folds and orientation suggesting movement in wind, and no clipping or floating artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heraldic flags are positioned on the battlements accurately. They exhibit natural folds and an orientation that suggests movement by wind, enhancing realism. Furthermore, there are no visible clipping or floating artifacts, indicating that the flags are integrated smoothly into the scene.",

      "question": "Are the tiny turrets and crenellated walls around the base of the orb evenly spaced, geometrically accurate, and stylistically consistent with the main castle structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiny turrets and crenellated walls are evenly spaced and their design remains consistent with the main castle structure. They align geometrically with the overall design, exhibiting a stylistic uniformity that contributes to the aesthetic and architectural coherence.",

      "question": "Are the golden rays integrated into the glass surface with proper refraction and depth, creating a seamless illusion of light emanating from within the orb without visible layering or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden rays are skillfully integrated, with proper refraction and depth that convincingly create the illusion of light emanating from within the orb. There are no visible layering issues or edge artifacts, providing a seamless transition that enhances the magical and radiant quality of the scene.",
