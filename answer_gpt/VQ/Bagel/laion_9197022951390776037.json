    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned just below the label and do they follow the curvature of the bottle with consistent lighting and reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartoon face on the bottle, with eyes that are placed directly on the bottle itself, distinct from the label. The eyes appear large and follow the contour of the bottle, showcasing an exaggerated, caricature-like style rather than realistic lighting or reflection consistency. This placement and artistic style diverge from real-world physics but suit the imageâ€™s whimsical nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the vines wrap around the bottle in a continuous, physically plausible manner without floating or intersecting the bottle in an unnatural way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vines wrap around the bottle in a playful, artistic manner, spiraling upwards. They do connect with the bottle consistently without appearing to float or intersect unnaturally with the bottle. This suggests an intended design feature typical in artistic illustrations, which does not aim for strict realism but maintains continuity in its fantastical context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the modified label icon a clear, proportionate face with distinct features that match the original icon's style and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The modified label in Image B does not feature a scarecrow icon but rather a large, expressive cartoon face taking up the entire label space. It does not match the minimalist and proportionate style of the original icon found in Image A. This new design diverges significantly in both style and proportion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background include layered grapevines and mist that recede naturally without obscuring or clipping the bottle incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B shows grapevines and a misty atmosphere, with depth and layers, creating a visible path that recedes naturally. The elements in the background, including the vines and mist, do not obscure the bottle improperly; instead, they frame it to establish a whimsical vineyard setting without technical errors in layering.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title \"The Curious Scarecrow Wine Adventure\" clearly visible, correctly positioned, and free from rendering artifacts such as pixelation or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any text, including the title \"The Curious Scarecrow Wine Adventure.\" Therefore, there is no visibility, positioning, or rendering of text to evaluate. The question references elements that are not present in the image.",
