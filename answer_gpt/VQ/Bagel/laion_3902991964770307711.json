      "question": "Do the top portions of the candelabra now appear as transparent, tapered glass caps with realistic light behavior and smooth contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicted is a perfume bottle, not a candelabra. The top portion of the perfume bottle is a solid cap that does not exhibit any qualities of transparent glass or tapered shapes expected in glass caps. It is a metallic-looking cap indicative of a typical perfume bottle design, and not the transparent glass typically associated with high-quality candelabra caps.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arms and central shaft replaced with smooth, uninterrupted gold-finish tubing that reflects light consistently and lacks visible seams or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no arms or central shaft typical of a candelabra; instead, the image shows a rectangular structured perfume bottle. The object possesses a gold-finish, but it is neither tubular nor part of a candelabra structure. Furthermore, the gold finish does not have visible seams or breaks, which is a consistent characteristic of luxury perfume bottles. This solid, seamless appearance matches its design purpose but is not related to candelabra arms or shafts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the brand logo embossed on the base such that it blends naturally with the surrounding texture and does not introduce irregular depth or lighting anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the perfume bottle in Image B does have a brand logo visible on its front side rather than its base. The logo is illustrated on a label and does not seem to possess embossing characteristics that affect surface texture or lighting depth characteristic anomalies. Its placement and texture suggest a flat label design intrinsic to perfume bottles, not an embossed candelabra base.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floral-engraved patterns evenly distributed, following the contours of the candelabra without flattening, repeating unnaturally, or appearing as surface overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns are visible as part of the perfume bottle design and are printed onto its surface, not engraved on a candelabra. The patterns follow the flat contour of the bottle's front face and appear naturally appealing without flattening or unnatural repeating. In terms of assessment, the patterns would not relate to candelabra contour adherence, distribution, or overlays.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the script font label on the central tube follow the curvature of the tube naturally, without warping, stretching, or overlapping with other surface details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the script font label is present on the perfume bottle and aligns with its flat surface area rather than a curved tube. This design ensures clarity without issues of warping or overlapping, which could arise on curved surfaces. As no central tube exists for comparison, it does not match scenarios of surface text placement on curved tubes of candelabras.",
