    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the moss textures on the tusks follow the curvature of the tusks and cast consistent shadows matching the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tusks are embellished with moss textures, which visually appear to be following the natural curvature of the tusks. These textures have been positioned thoughtfully to ensure continuity along the curves, and they cast shadows that seem consistent with the overall lighting direction in the environment. By evaluating the shadow characteristics and their alignment with the tusk curvature, it is reasonable to conclude that the shadows are accurate according to the lighting direction.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the waterfall-like mane flow continuously from the top of the head downward without intersecting or distorting the snout or ear regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mane starts at the top of the warthog's head and flows downward in a waterfall-like manner. When analyzing its placement, it appears to flow naturally, without abruptly cutting across or distorting the warthog's snout or ears. The design maintains a sense of organic flow along the head, suggesting continuity in its placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the leaf-styled patterns aligned with the natural folds and contours of the warthogâ€™s body, avoiding abrupt edges or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaf-styled patterns on the body of the warthog in Image B are artistically integrated with its form. By examining how these patterns align with the contours and folds of the body, it becomes clear that the patterns follow the natural shape of the warthog, avoiding any abrupt edges or points of visual misalignment. The design adheres to the body's surface, enhancing the overall appearance seamlessly.",

      "question": "Are the fungi positioned along the spine and upper back without overlapping legs or protruding unnaturally into the air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fungi are positioned along the spine and upper back of the warthog. Visually, they appear to be placed in harmony with the animal's structure, avoiding any overlap with the legs or protruding into the air unnaturally. Their placement complements the curvature of the back, contributing to a cohesive appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing eyes remain within the eye sockets, preserving the shape of the eyelids and surrounding facial features without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the glowing eyes in Image B, they are situated within the eye sockets of the warthog's face. The design maintains the integrity of the eyelids and surrounding facial features, avoiding any distortion. The eyes glow but remain correctly positioned within the natural structures, ensuring no distortion occurs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the branch-shaped hooves connect naturally to the lower legs and maintain consistent joint alignment without breaking the leg structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branch-shaped hooves in Image B merge naturally with the lower legs of the warthog. Analyzing the connection point, it becomes evident that the design supports a consistent joint alignment from the leg to the hoof, maintaining the leg structure without apparent breaks or misalignments.",
