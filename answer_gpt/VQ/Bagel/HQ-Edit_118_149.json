      "question": "Are the pastel-colored areas of the dancer's leotard and tights smoothly blended without visible color artifacts or unnatural transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's leotard and tights are represented in a simplified, stylized format with solid pastel colors typically used in illustrations, which avoids any visible color artifacts or unnatural transitions due to the nature of this design. Since this is a graphic depiction, the smooth blending that might be an issue in photography is inherently absent here.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the detachable sections around the dancer’s leg maintain consistent thickness and alignment with the leg’s natural curvature, avoiding floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration is created with even outlines providing a consistent thickness. The depiction is stylized rather than realistic, so issues like 'floating or misaligned edges' typically appearing in manipulated photographs do not apply here. The depiction overall maintains consistent alignment with the geometric simplification inherent in illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the angular transformations applied to the dancer’s limbs physically plausible, with joints and limbs maintaining correct anatomical relationships and no exaggerated bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized representation with simplified features, not intended for anatomical accuracy. The limbs maintain a consistent drawing style, and despite minor exaggerations inherent in such graphics to express movement, they are not extreme or unrealistic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the dancer’s sticker figures cleanly integrated onto the journal surface, with shadows and lighting matching the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sticker illustration is subtly layered over the journal, and due to its illustrated nature, shadows and lighting matching the surrounding are generally not represented or required. The design does not appear misaligned or out of place, thus they remain cleanly integrated based on context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dancer’s hands retain five fingers each, with natural spacing and proportions, and no fused or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, hands and fingers are not explicitly detailed due to the stylized nature of the illustration, focusing on simplified outlines typical in these graphics. Thus there are no detailed fingers visible to evaluate based on realism.",
