    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the golden scepter in the man's right hand have a smooth, reflective metallic surface that matches the lighting conditions without exhibiting unnatural texture artifacts or inconsistent highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden scepter held by the man appears to have a simplified and cartoonish appearance, typical in illustrative art styles. This means the scepter does not display a smooth, reflective surface with qualities such as reflections or highlights that typically mimic real metal under certain lighting. Instead, it likely has a uniform color with minimal texture, reflective of a stylized representation rather than naturalistic depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pastel-colored fabrics of the man’s coat, vest, trousers, and shirt rendered with visible texture and depth, maintaining natural folds and shadows without appearing flat or washed out?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's clothing is illustrated in a cartoon style, which does not emphasize realistic texture or depth. Pastel colors are used, and while some indication of folds may be present, the focus is on simplicity and flatness, lacking the intricate detail and depth that convey realistic fabric rendering.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cobblestones beneath the man’s feet form a continuous, evenly spaced pattern with natural irregularities and consistent shading, avoiding broken or misaligned stones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cobblestones in Image B are part of an illustration, typically stylized and simplified. They are designed to convey an idea of a cobblestone surface rather than an exact representation, so they appear evenly spaced with little intricacy regarding natural irregularities or shading. The focus on uniformity over realism suggests they do not have the variability or detailed shading of real stones.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the detachable note sections placed along the outer edges of the image without overlapping the man or background architecture, and do they have clean, uniform borders resembling paper cutouts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The detachable note sections are clearly positioned around the main illustration without overlapping it. They are drawn with clean, solid lines, resembling paper cutouts, maintaining separation from the central figure, which communicates organizational clarity typical of graphic design or illustrative packaging.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the man’s right hand gripping the scepter show five clearly defined fingers with natural joint angles and no deformation, while the left hand in the pocket maintains a relaxed, anatomically accurate pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand gripping the scepter is simplified, consistent with the illustrative style. Such styles often do not portray all anatomical details, like clearly defined fingers with realistic joint angles. Similarly, the left hand placed in the pocket lacks detailed anatomical accuracy, reflecting artistic stylization over realism.",
