    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes applied to the suit clearly defined, aligned with the contours of the body, and free from jagged or broken edges that disrupt the figure’s natural posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit is constructed using geometric shapes with sharp edges and clean lines. The shapes are aligned with the contours of the body and support the figure's posture. The design showcases clear segments that correspond well with the body's natural lines without disruption. Analyzing this, it can be concluded that the geometric shapes are orderly and do not have any jagged or broken edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chair retain a stable, grounded structure with symmetrical, flowing patterns that align with the figure’s seated position and do not appear to float or tilt unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a chair composed of geometric shapes. The design reflects symmetry and organization, maintaining a stable appearance that supports the figure's seated position. The patterns are such that they give the impression of being grounded. Considering this analysis, the chair maintains a stable structure.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the sunset gradient in the background smooth and continuous, with no abrupt color shifts or haloing along the edges of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gradient of the sunset in the background transitions smoothly from one color to another without apparent abrupt shifts or haloing around the figure. The gradient presents a continuous flow between colors. Based on this, it's evident that the sunset gradient is smooth without harsh transitions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the metallic silver and blue areas of the suit show coherent highlights and reflections that follow a single light source and avoid repeating textures or unnatural glossiness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits areas on the suit with distinct highlights and reflections, consistent with a single light source without excessive glossiness or repeating textures. These highlights appear naturally distributed, aligning with typical metallic reflections that enhance the design. Thus, the suit reflects coherent lighting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand on the chair have five distinct fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and are the joints and knuckles proportionally accurate and not distorted by stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand depicted in Image B is stylized with angular shapes, and the representation offers different proportions compared to natural anatomy. The fingers are not distinctly defined with natural spacing or curvature, and joint and knuckle proportions are abstracted due to stylization. Thus, the hand in Image B does not showcase natural anatomy.",
