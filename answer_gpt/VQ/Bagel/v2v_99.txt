    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi-style 3D soccer player appear to blend seamlessly with the realistic soccer field and stadium without any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a chibi-style 3D soccer player placed in a realistic soccer field and stadium environment. The chibi-style character has exaggerated features typical of this artistic style, which contrasts sharply with the realistic environment. Such a clash in styles often leads to noticeable inconsistencies, as the textures and proportions of the cartoonish player starkly differ from the environment, making seamless blending difficult.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the chibi-style 3D soccer player maintain proper proportions and physical logic, avoiding any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "The chibi-style 3D soccer player in Image B intentionally uses exaggerated, non-realistic proportions as part of its artistic style, such as a larger head and shortened limbs. However, within the context of chibi art, these features are consistent and do not involve any actual distortions or broken geometric shapes. This style adheres to its own logical form rather than realistic proportions.",
