      "question": "Does the woman’s body posture while leaning against the hut appear physically plausible, with correct alignment of limbs and no unnatural bending or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is standing next to a hut, and her body posture is visually consistent with reality; her limbs appear naturally aligned with her standing position, without any visible unnatural bending or floating. The positioning of her arms and the way she appears to be in contact with the hut support the notion that her posture is physically plausible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the abstracted beaded jewelry elements rendered with smooth transitions and consistent geometric patterns, without visible artifacts such as blurring or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the abstracted beadwork on the woman's clothing has smooth transitions and an adherence to consistent geometric patterns. The lines are crisp without any blurring or visual distortions, maintaining a clear and coherent appearance that signifies precision in the abstraction process.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the silhouette of the woman cleanly separated from the background with no jagged edges, ghosting, or misaligned contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouette of the woman in Image B is sharply delineated from the background, exhibiting no jagged edges or ghosting. The contours are smoothly aligned, providing a clean separation from the surrounding colors of the background, which ensures a clear visual representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric borders applied consistently around each postcard without overlapping or distorting the main subject or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric borders around each section are consistent and appropriately placed, neither overlapping nor distorting the main subjects or the background details. The borders help to frame each element effectively without interfering with the integrity of the internal visual content.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the patterns and textures on the woman’s traditional clothing appear continuous and undistorted across all three versions, with no unexpected highlights or material shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The traditional clothing's patterns and textures in Image B are consistently extended across all sections without distortion. The visual continuity is preserved, and there are no unexpected highlights or shifts in the material that could suggest a break in the fabric's uniformity or texture.",
