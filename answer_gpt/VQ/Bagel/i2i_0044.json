      "question": "Do the lettuce shapes appear as intended smears without breaking their natural connection to the sandwich and without introducing any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lettuce on the sandwich appears distinctly stylized to fit the cartoon-like aesthetic. This involves noticeable simplification and exaggeration of shapes which visually separate it from the sandwich, suggesting a breaking of the natural connection. The textures introduced seem more painted and less natural, typical of this artistic styling, thus introducing deliberate abstraction that might be interpreted as unnatural in terms of realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added sauce decorations around the plate visually coherent, maintaining a smooth transition with the plate and table without causing any unnatural disruptions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sauce appears as green splashes on the plate. They are directionally consistent with the stylized aesthetic but clash with any realistic interpretation of sauce placement due to their unnatural shapes and colors. There is no smooth transition with the plate and table as the cartoon-like rendering starkly contrasts with realistic texture expectations.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the enhanced cross-section texture of the sandwich appear natural and detailed without any obvious artificial patterns or textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich's cross-section has been illustrated with bold, simplified lines typical of a cartoon style. This style tends to flatten textures and remove natural detailing, which introduces artificial patterns inherent to this artistic approach, making them appear less natural and realistic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the thick-painted cartoon style been applied uniformly across the sandwich with a realistic touch, avoiding any distortions or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a uniform application of the thick-painted cartoon style over the entire sandwich. However, the choice of stylization inherently includes simplified and exaggerated forms, which might not reflect realistic shapes as observed in real-life objects. While uniformity in style is maintained, realism is not the priority of this style, hence causing distortions that reject realistic expectations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sandwich structure retain its integrity and logical placement on the plate alongside the salad, all while maintaining visual credibility in the thick-painted style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich structure appears to be consistent with its depicted position on the plate, showing consideration of logical placement alongside the salad. Despite the exaggerated style, the integrity of layout and spatial logic is maintained, adhering to expected positioning and context within the given stylized interpretation.",
