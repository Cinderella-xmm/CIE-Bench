      "question": "Are the chibi-style 3D models of the sheep and clock free from unnatural textures and maintain their fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep and clock exhibit smooth, rounded surfaces characteristic of chibi-style 3D modeling. The textures appear intentionally simplistic, reflecting the art style, and there are no signs of pixelation or distortions. The details, like the sheep's eyes and the numbers on the clock, remain crisp and distinct, indicating an adherence to detail without unnatural textures disrupting the style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the sheep appear naturally leaning against the clock without any distortion or unnatural positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep is positioned next to the clock in a static scene inside a snow globe. Given the stylized nature of the chibi model, the sheep appears proportionately close to the clock, with no unnatural gaps or overlaps suggestive of poor positioning. The design maintains charm without compromising logical placement, suggesting a carefully crafted interaction between the figures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the gently drifting snowflakes inside the snow globe add to the scene naturally without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowflakes in Image B are depicted as small, detailed variations, gently positioned around the snow globe scene. They do not overlap with each other in an unrealistic manner and maintain a believable distribution pattern within the confines of the globe. There are no visible artifacts or awkward layering that would disrupt the intended illusion of snowfall.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wooden tabletop and warm, neutral-toned background create a visually harmonious and cozy atmosphere without any inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop and background tones are warm, enhancing the cozy feel of the scene. The soft-focus background complements the sharper foreground elements, such as the snow globe, while the wood's texture adds to the visual warmth without any off-putting inconsistencies or abrupt color shifts that could distract from the composite harmony.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the snow globe, sheep, clock, and tabletop consistent and logical?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B shows the snow globe containing the sheep and clock, positioned on a tabletop. The proportions of all elements are intentionally stylized yet remain consistent within the scene's context. The relationship between them appears carefully considered, showing logical spatial arrangements that are both visually pleasing and proportionate according to the rules of aesthetic design within a stylized context.",
