      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the angel's facial skin retain smooth, consistent texture and natural coloration without artificial halos, pixelation, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial skin is blurred for privacy or aesthetic reasons, which intentionally obscures any visible details of texture or coloration. As such, it is impossible to assess texture or consistent coloration. Therefore, the criteria of smooth texture and natural coloration cannot be evaluated accurately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added ornate garments visually integrated with the figure’s body, showing realistic draping, fold depth, and material consistency without floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornate garments have been added to the figure, featuring intricate patterns and a rich, textured appearance. The integration seems coherent as the garments appear to follow the natural curvature of the figure's body, showing realistic draping and depth with detailed folds that give a sense of material consistency. There is no visual indication of floating or disconnected elements in comparison to the angel’s natural body posture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the wings appear as subtle, layered highlights that follow the natural curvature of the feathers without creating sharp, unnatural glares or breaking feather edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold accents on the wings in Image B are highlighted in a way that seems to follow the curvature of the feathers. These accents appear subtle and enhance the depth and texture of the feathers without creating sharp, unnatural glares or disrupting the feather structure. The highlights are layered in a way that respects the natural form of the wings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the angel’s figure and the new celestial background smooth, with consistent lighting direction and no abrupt edges or mismatched depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the angel's figure and the added celestial background is visually seamless. The lighting appears to be consistent, illuminating the angel from the same direction as suggested by highlights on the garments and wings. There are no abrupt edges or mismatched depth cues, creating a cohesive integration into the celestial setting.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands show five fingers each with natural joint alignment, proper shadowing, and skin texture without swelling, extra digits, or unnatural contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are depicted with five fingers each. The shadows and skin texture appear natural, with the joint alignments reflecting typical human anatomy. There is no apparent swelling, extra digits, or unnatural contours, suggesting the hands have been accurately rendered with a realistic portrayal.",
