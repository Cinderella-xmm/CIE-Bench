      "question": "Does the plastic figurine maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the character's body, avoiding distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine appears to have well-maintained proportions that are consistent with a toy or action figure representing a superhero character. The body is muscular, the armor fits proportionately, and there are no visible distortions or broken geometric shapes. This is typical for superhero figurines, which are often designed to mimic the human form in exaggerated heroic proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added lighting effects around the plastic figurine seamlessly integrated with its surface and the surrounding desk, avoiding unnatural highlights or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting effects in Image B appear to be consistent with ambient lighting that might come from a nearby lamp, as suggested by the light casting on the surface of the desk and the overall scene setting. The highlights on the figurine and the play of light and shadow are coherent with a typical tabletop figure placement under an artificial light source.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the hands of the plastic figurine holding the hammer retain natural textures and shapes, with no more than five fingers and no signs of ergonomic distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands of the figurine in Image B appear to be holding the hammer naturally, with a clear, solid grip characteristic of action figures. The fingers and thumb are visible with no apparent distortion in their count or shape, indicating that basic anatomical and ergonomic proportions are maintained.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the plastic figurine retained a structurally sound head and face consistent with the character's identity, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the face is blurred and cannot be evaluated, the structural integrity of the figure's head as a whole, such as hair and shape, appears consistent and without any unnatural forms. The rest of the model retains enough character identity to infer it aligns well with the known character features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the armor and cape of the plastic figurine appear cohesive with the rest of the figurine, avoiding any unnatural textures or materials that disrupt the visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor and cape of the figurine are cohesively designed, matching in style and texture to give a seamless appearance as part of the same superhero ensemble. The textures and colors are consistent with typical action figures, which are designed to look authentically like their on-screen counterparts without any visually disruptive elements.",
