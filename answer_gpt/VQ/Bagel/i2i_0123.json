      "question": "Does the robotic dog holding a coin blend seamlessly with the parking meterâ€™s timer area, maintaining its structural coherence and avoiding obvious unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small robotic dog holding a coin is positioned inside the timer area of the left parking meter. The logic behind determining natural blending involves assessing the consistency of lighting, shadows, and distortions. The addition looks slightly out of place due to irregularities in shadow and contrast, which are different from the rest of the meter, indicating the edit might not be flawless.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the robotic dog and the coin appear consistent with the rest of the parking meter, avoiding any unnatural or out-of-place surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robotic dog and the coin have a different texture and reflectiveness compared to the matte and metallic surfaces of the parking meter. The dog and the coin appear glossy and shiny, which contrasts the more subdued finish of the meter, making them appear out of place.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the positioning of the robotic dog within the timer area proportional and physically realistic, without distorting or disrupting the geometry of the parking meter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robotic dog is placed within the timer area, which disturbs the original function and space layout. The size and alignment do not fit naturally within the arc of the time gauge, and its position inside that area seems forced and disproportionate, disrupting the meter's geometry.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the robotic dog holding a coin logically coexist with the parking meter's billing function, ensuring both actions appear plausible and coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of a robotic dog inside the timer area of a parking meter does not align with the functional purpose of displaying time or payment-related information. This addition seems whimsical and unrelated to the practical function of a parking meter.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire composition of the edited image, including the robotic dog and coin, appear authentic and consistent with the original scene without introducing any distracting or incongruous elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of the robotic dog and coin is not harmonious with the original scene of parking meters on a city street. It introduces a distracting element that contrasts with the otherwise mundane and realistic setting, making the composition appear less authentic.",
