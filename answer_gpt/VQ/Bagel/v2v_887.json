        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character's hat and apron in Image B are typical of a chef's outfit, which do not share the texture or appearance of a pizza's golden crust and gooey cheese found in Image A. These elements in Image B are depicted with plain colors typical of clothing, rather than resembling food or pizza texture.",
