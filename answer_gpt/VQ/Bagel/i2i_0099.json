      "question": "Does the mug maintain its structural integrity and geometric shape after being converted into an oil painting, without appearing distorted or broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug appears as a stylized interpretation in the oil painting style, akin to the brush stroke technique seen in famous artworks like Van Gogh's. Although the shape is more abstract, it does not appear distorted or broken. The wavy strokes suggest a deliberate artistic approach rather than an unintended distortion. Thus, within the context of an oil painting, its structural integrity is maintained, albeit with a creative twist.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or obvious artifacts present on the mug or coffee surface after the style conversion to an oil painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the mug and coffee surface with deliberate brush strokes that simulate the texture typical of oil paintings. These strokes create a flowing, artistic representation without unnatural artifacts since they align with the stylistic choices characteristic of a painting. Therefore, within the norms of oil painting aesthetics, there are no obvious artifacts that detract from the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the mug and its surroundings remain visually credible and consistent with an oil painting style, without looking out of place or overly artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows are interpreted through energetic brush strokes, consistent with a lively, expressive painting style like that of Van Gogh's 'Starry Night'. The bold use of colors and strokes create its own version of light and shadow, maintaining credibility within the artistic context without appearing artificial. Thus, for an oil painting interpretation, they are consistent and visually coherent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the materials of the mug and the coaster still look natural and appropriate for an oil painting, without showing any signs of unnatural blending or inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the mug and coaster with textures and colors rendered in thick, energetic strokes, typical of oil paintings. This method conveys depth and background context, and while resembling artistic interpretation more than reality, it does not feature unnatural blending or inconsistency. The style remains coherent with both the mug and coaster possessing the vigorous brush-stroke motif that fits seamlessly into the painted setting.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the mug handle and its reflections been preserved clearly, without any significant loss of detail or degradation in the oil painting conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug handle and reflections are shown through exaggerated, stylized strokes typical of expressive oil paintings. While this approach may omit realistic fine details typically seen in photos, it fits the nature of painting's broad strokes and abstraction without degradation of detail, since that is inherent to the style. Thus, there is no significant loss because details are portrayed in a different interpretative style consistent with oil painting aesthetics.",
