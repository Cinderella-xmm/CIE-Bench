      "question": "Is the sun disc replacing the Sphinx’s head seamlessly integrated with the neck and body, showing no jagged edges or misaligned contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sphinx's head is replaced by a radiant sun disc. To evaluate the integration, I examine how the sun disc connects to the neck and body. Seamless integration would mean the edges where the sun disc and neck meet should be smooth and aligned without visible separation. The transition must look natural, matching the original posture and flow of the Sphinx. There are no visible misalignments or jagged edges implying a seamless integration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the golden wings extend symmetrically from the sides of the Sphinx’s body with smooth, continuous surfaces and natural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings should ideally extend from the sides symmetrically with a smooth surface and natural feathering or curvature. In Image B, both wings appear golden and extend outward. They should mirror each other in terms of size, direction, and curvature. The wings in Image B do seem to extend symmetrically, aligning well with the body. Their surfaces appear smooth and consistent.",

      "question": "Are the sand flows on the limbs continuous and gravity-consistent, without abrupt breaks or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Sand flows should adhere to gravity, flowing downward naturally from the limbs without any breaks or segments that appear to be floating incorrectly. In the edited image, the surfaces and limbs suggest continuous and natural flow that adheres to gravitational forces, without any disruptive or unnatural breaks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ankhs on the paws correctly shaped, properly scaled, and emitting a soft, localized glow without distorting adjacent textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Ankhs should be correctly shaped, resembling a cross with a loop at the top. They must be proportionate and positioned on the paws naturally. The glow should be subtle and localized so as not to distort or overly illuminate the textures nearby. In Image B, the ankhs seem well-shaped, and the glowing effect appears soft, ensuring no distortion of adjacent textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire edited figure exhibit consistent lighting and shading across all added elements, with no visible seams or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Consistency in lighting and shading across elements is assessed by examining how light interacts with each part, ensuring that added features do not appear out of place due to lighting discrepancies. All elements, including the sun disc and wings, appear harmonized in terms of illumination. There are no noticeable seams or mismatches, indicating smooth integration.",
