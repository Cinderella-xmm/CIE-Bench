      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brass finishes on the ship’s hull and superstructure smooth and consistent in texture, with no visible cracks, pixelation, or mismatched shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship inside the lantern has a brass finish that is visually consistent and well-rendered. The metallic surfaces appear smooth without any signs of pixelation or inconsistent shading, suggesting a digitized or artistically rendered scene made to appear polished. The detailing on the surface—including joints and edges—maintain a uniform texture without appearing cracked or mismatched, which indicates careful attention to maintaining a cohesive aesthetic as typically observed in paintings or digital artistry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metal automatons have five fingers per hand, properly articulated limbs, and clothing that conforms to the body shape without unnatural wrinkles or floating fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metal automatons visible in Image B are artistically depicted with certain stylistic features that do not adhere strictly to realistic human proportions. They seem to lack detailed fingers, instead having basic shapes that roughly suggest hands. Their limbs are depicted in a stylized manner that lacks articulated joints typical of human anatomy. Additionally, their clothing, although tailored to the figures, tends to be simplistic and does not conform precisely to realistic body shapes, showing a more artistic or whimsical design choice rather than a precise mechanical representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass lantern clearly defined around the scene, with transparent sides, visible metal framing, and no overlapping or missing sections that break the enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass lantern encasing the miniature steampunk ship is well-defined, with a clear indication of glass and metal framing that maintains the integrity of the enclosure. The frame elements are distinct and appear to follow the typical structure of a lantern, ensuring that all parts are connected without any sections overlapping or missing. This attention to detail ensures the scene inside is enclosed properly by the virtual glass structure, creating a cohesive miniature display.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the steam clouds rendered with smooth gradients and soft edges, appearing to float naturally within the lantern without jagged borders or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam clouds depicted within the lantern in Image B are crafted with a smooth, soft-edged appearance that mimics the natural behavior of clouds or steam. They exhibit gentle gradients and appear to hover naturally within the scene, enhancing the whimsical atmosphere without any abrupt edges or unexpected shifts in color. This artistic choice contributes to a cohesive, fluid look, reinforcing a dreamy or fantastical theme typical in this type of illustrative artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the compasses and flags placed in logical positions relative to the ship and dock, with proper orientation and size that does not distort the spatial relationships between objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flags and compass-like elements portrayed in Image B are positioned to blend seamlessly with the steampunk aesthetic of the miniature ship scene. Their placement is thoughtful relative to surrounding objects, such as ensuring that flags appear affixed to appropriate sections of the ship and compasses add to the theme without imposing on the balance of the environment. This ensures that spatial relationships are respected, maintaining a logical and aesthetic coherence typical of curated artistic displays.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the rotating gears and mechanical components attached to the ship’s structure with visible supports, and do they follow the contours of the hull and deck without floating or intersecting incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the steampunk assembly inside the lantern in Image B, the gears and mechanical elements are visually coalesced to align with the ship's body. They are depicted with apparent connections and supports, giving the impression of attachment to the hull and deck. These components follow the curves and angles of the ship's structure correctly without appearing to float aimlessly or intersect at impractical angles, indicating precise artistic intention to enhance the technological atmosphere inherent in steampunk designs.",
