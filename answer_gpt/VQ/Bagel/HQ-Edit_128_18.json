    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the green foliage motifs surrounding the giraffe composed of smooth, organically shaped leaves with consistent shading and no jagged edges or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts leaves with smooth contours and consistent shading, typical of stylized jungle-themed decorations. The absence of jagged edges or pixelation suggests well-rendered, digitally created shapes, fitting the common representation in marketing visuals.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the animal footprints on the floor follow a logical path from the giraffe toward the edge of the room, with consistent depth and spacing that matches typical animal gait patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the footprints appear more as decorative elements on the background rather than actual impressions on the floor. They are stylistically placed, which doesn't follow a realistic gait pattern or path one might expect from an animal moving across the floor.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the clear packaging around each plush toy transparent with visible surface highlights and subtle distortion of the toyâ€™s shape beneath, consistent with real plastic wrap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows plush toys encased in transparent packaging. Highlights and subtle distortions observed are consistent with realistic depictions of plastic wrap, which often bends light and slightly distorts the object within while maintaining transparency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the colorful letters on the wall aligned properly with the wall surface, showing no gaps, blurring, or inconsistent font scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colorful letters appear to be part of a planned and coherent design with consistent alignment and clear, crisp font presentation. This aligns with typical standards for well-rendered signages or posters.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the giraffe retain its original body proportions and soft fabric texture, with no stretching, flattening, or unnatural seams introduced during the transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The giraffe in Image B retains a consistent appearance with typical plush toy proportions and soft fabric texture, maintaining realistic details without any unnatural distortions that would indicate poor image editing or transformation from its original appearance.",
