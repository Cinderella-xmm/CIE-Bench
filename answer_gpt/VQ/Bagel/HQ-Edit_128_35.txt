    "Question": "Q1: Is the typewriter’s keyboard area preserved with correct key layout and spacing, and does the body maintain a coherent rectangular form without warped edges or missing parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the keyboard area consists of round keys with uniform spacing typical of classic typewriters. The body of the typewriter maintains straight lines and right angles, suggesting a coherent rectangular form without distortion. The familiarity of these shapes helps establish that the layout and structure appear consistent and intact.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the text 'Tales Untold' positioned above the keyboard area without covering any functional parts of the typewriter, and does it follow a horizontal baseline consistent with the notebook’s orientation?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the text 'Tales Untold' on the notebook cover, not above the typewriter's keyboard area. The text aligns horizontally with the notebook’s orientation, maintaining a consistent baseline, which is evident as it does not overlap with any functional typewriter components. The positioning and angle indicate that the display setup is logical for a notebook cover.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the ink splatters scattered irregularly across the surface, with varying sizes and soft edges, and do they not obscure important structural elements like the keys or paper?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, ink splatters are visible on the notebook cover. They appear irregular and vary in size with soft edges, consistent with natural ink behavior. Since Image B focuses on the notebook, and the ink splatters do not obscure the typewriter keys or paper, they do not affect functional structures as expected.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the marbled background continue evenly under the entire base of the notebook cover, with no visible gaps, clipping, or abrupt color shifts at the edges?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a notebook cover on a marbled surface. The marbled pattern runs consistently across the image and covers the base of the notebook without interruptions or visible disparities in color or pattern at the edges. This continuity suggests a well-integrated background design that avoids clipping.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the leather spine show a consistent texture with slight color variation, and are the embossed key icons evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and shaded to suggest depth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the notebook’s leather spine has a uniform texture, with slight variations in color typical of natural leather. The embossed key icons are evenly spaced and exhibit clear shapes with shading that creates the illusion of depth. These visual elements contribute to the perception of a well-crafted leather design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
