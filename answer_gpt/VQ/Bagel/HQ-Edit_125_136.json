      "question": "Are the shapes of the astronaut's helmet, suit segments, and life support pack simplified but still geometrically consistent with their original forms without jagged or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut's helmet and suit are depicted in a stylized, cartoon-like design. This involves a simplification where edges and outlines are smooth and round, typical for graphic illustrations rather than realistic renderings. By combining this visual information with world knowledge, we understand that such depiction often means the design is consistent geometrically but simplified. The image shows continuous outlines without jagged edges, adhering to a geometric but simplified form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the texture applied to the spacesuit appear uniformly distributed and physically plausible, without unnatural repetition or artificial pattern artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spacesuit texture is rendered as a smooth, featureless surface typical in simplistic design styles. This approach deliberately omits realistic details and textures seen in actual spacesuits, creating a stylized look without visible patterns. While lacking physical texture realism, this is characteristic of graphical art, which aims for visual clarity over realism. Therefore, there are no unnatural pattern artifacts or repetition since the surfaces are intentionally untextured.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the accent gold colors confined to specific design elements (such as patch borders or connectors) and do they blend naturally without color bleed into adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold colors are visibly placed on the astronaut's shoulder badge and other confined areas, which are typical features in illustrations to create emphasis while keeping color control tight. These accents are distinctly separated without any blending into surrounding areas, which is consistent with typical design practices where color bleed is avoided to maintain a clean aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the directional arrows show clear movement from the astronaut toward the ISS without overlapping or distorting the astronaut’s limbs or the station structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the directional arrows are clearly positioned around the astronaut, indicating movement directions. They are stylistically separated from the astronaut’s limbs and the ISS, suggesting paths without causing visual interference with those objects. In illustrations, it's crucial that movement indicators do not overlap with the main subjects to maintain clarity. The arrows are placed to suggest directional cues effectively.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text positioned at the bottom edge of the image without covering critical parts of the Moon or ISS, and is it clearly readable without distortion or shadow effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is prominently positioned at the bottom, separate from key visual elements like the Moon or ISS, which ensures these elements remain the focal point. The text is large and clearly legible, maintaining uniformity in font style with no signs of distortion or shadow effects that could hamper readability. Such placement is typical in design to allow both image elements and text to be appreciated together.",
