    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the spires and roof layers of the creature aligned with the original building's structure, showing no signs of bending, breaking, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature has spires and roof layers that resemble architectural elements. The alignment is consistent with an imaginary structure of this fantastical design, not showing any signs of bending or misalignment relative to its intended fantasy aesthetic. The comparison with Image A indicates that while both images feature intricate architecture, Image B transforms these elements into a creature for a fantasy context.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the orb at the creature’s feet feature pillars and arches that match the architectural style of the creature and have consistent texture and lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orb is adorned with architectural motifs that match the overall fantasy style of the creature. Pillars and arches are consistent with the fantasy architecture depicted in the creature, maintaining coherent texture and lighting. Comparing Image A and B, while Image A focuses on traditional architectural elements, Image B integrates them into both the creature and the orb, ensuring consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the invented name displayed near the creature legible, properly sized, and positioned without overlapping the creature or water reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a name 'Myrns' near the creature, which is legibly styled and appropriately sized, positioned without overlapping other elements in the image. The name does not interfere with the design of the creature or reflection. A comparison here relies solely on Image B as Image A does not bear textual elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the elemental type label (e.g., Mystic, Stone) visible near the creature and styled to match the overall fantasy aesthetic without appearing digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the word 'Myrns' which appears stylized to match the fantasy aesthetic of the image, integrated seamlessly rather than appearing digitally added. This contributes to a cohesive design wherein textual elements enhance the overall theme rather than detracting from it.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature’s surface display smooth shading and consistent texture across all architectural elements, with no visible pixelation, blurring, or unnatural color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's surface displays smooth shading and consistent texture across its architectural elements, fitting the fantasy theme. No pixelation or unnatural color patches are evident, which indicates careful consideration in the design process to maintain visual consistency, which is essential for fantasy illustrations.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the creature’s limbs proportionally sized and structurally connected to the main body in a way that suggests physical stability and logical weight distribution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the creature with limbs that are proportionately sized and logically connected to its main body, suggesting physical stability which is particularly vital in depicting fantastical creatures. The creature's design integrates architectural elements into a cohesive, stable structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks a water reflection as the creature is situated on steps rather than near a reflective surface, which differs from Image A. Therefore, there isn't a reflection in Image B to evaluate, and the comparison is not applicable here.",
