    "Question": "Q4: Do the darker and lighter wood tones create a clear distinction between the shoe's main body and highlights, such as the toe cap and midsole, without unnatural color shifts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the use of darker and lighter wood tones effectively distinguishes the shoe's main body from the highlights, like the toe cap and midsole. These tones are applied in a way consistent with wood grains and shades, without any unnatural color shifts. This gradation reflects the natural diversity seen in wooden textures, accentuating the shoe's features.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the brand names and logos (e.g., 'Salomon', 'Speedcross', 'Contagrip') clearly readable and accurately positioned on the shoe, with clean edges and no blurring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe seems to be a wooden-crafted interpretation and does not use traditional branding methods. Therefore, there are no visible brand names or logos that follow the positioning in Image A. This suggests that the focus in Image B is on the artistic wooden depiction rather than on showcasing brand logos.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q6: Does the outsole feature deep, well-defined treads and a reinforced toe cap, with consistent depth and spacing that matches the original shoeâ€™s geometry?",
    "explanation": "The wooden shoe in Image B has a detailed wooden carving for the outsole, which creatively interprets the tread design. While it appears well-defined and resembles the original concept, the nature of the material means that it may not perfectly mimic the rubber tread depth and spacing of the original shoe in terms of practical use. However, for a decorative wooden design, the representation is consistent in maintaining the essence of tread designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
