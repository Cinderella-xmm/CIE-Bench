      "question": "Are the clothing and hairstyle features of the players accurately represented in chibi form without artificial or distorted textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters have clothing and hairstyles that are simplified versions of real life features typically associated with such animated depictions. The visual cues like the hair ponytail and tennis outfits are simplified and stylized in a manner akin to the chibi art style. There is no indication of distorted textures typical of poor image editing, and the features align with chibi representations, which tend to be exaggerated for effect rather than distorted.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the players' hands in the handshake pose appear natural and anatomically correct, with no missing or extra fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it is clear that the chibi characters exhibit hands with anatomically correct details. The fingers are visible, proportionate, and the handshake pose looks natural within the context of chibi art, which sometimes exaggerates features but still respects basic anatomical accuracy. There are no missing or extra fingers.",

      "question": "Does the semi-transparent tennis court logo integrate smoothly into the background without creating distracting artifacts or distorting the tennis court?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The semi-transparent tennis court logo in Image B is designed to act as a backdrop that does not intrude on the main subjectsâ€”the chibi characters. It is placed in a way that complements the overall composition without causing visual distortion or artifacts. Chibi art typically allows for stylized backdrops, which can include logos or patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tennis rackets proportionally appropriate for the chibi characters and clearly identifiable as tennis rackets without any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tennis rackets in Image B are identifiable despite their stylized proportions, which is typical for chibi characters. The rackets have shape and detailing consistent with known racket designs, keeping in line with the artistic license of the chibi style. There are no unnatural distortions, and they are proportionately appropriate within the chibi form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details like facial expressions and clothing patterns on the chibi characters been preserved without significant loss or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In chibi art, facial expressions and clothing details are often simplified for stylistic purposes rather than detailed realism. Image B maintains the essence of expressions and clothing through its simplified depiction, which aligns with the expected chibi representation. No significant loss or unnatural smoothing is evident, considering this art style's characteristics.",
