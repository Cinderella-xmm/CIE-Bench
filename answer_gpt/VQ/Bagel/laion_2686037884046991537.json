    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and mouth drawn on the whoopie pie surfaces aligned with the curvature of the cookie and free from visible distortions or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and mouth of the whoopie pie are cartoonishly drawn directly onto the surface of the character on the right. The eyes and mouth seem to follow the curvature of the whoopie pie, giving the impression that they are part of the surface, rather than superimposed. There are no visible distortions or elements that give the appearance of floating, suggesting that they have been integrated well into the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chocolate cookie surface retain its original texture pattern (such as cracks and dimples) beneath the cartoon-style coloring, or is it completely smoothed out in an unnatural way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chocolate cookie surface seems to maintain a semblance of its original texture in terms of visual cracks and dimples, which are characteristic features of a whoopie pie. The cartoon coloring has not completely smoothed out these textural details, allowing it to look more natural rather than fully altered.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the limbs of the whoopie pie characters proportionally scaled to the cookie body and connected at logical points (e.g., sides or top), without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, the limbs of the whoopie pie character appear to be proportionally scaled relative to their body, which helps maintain the balance of the character's design. The limbs are connected at logical points such as the sides of the cookie body, and they don't seem to be floating or misaligned, ensuring a coherent and animated look.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the spatula held by the leading whoopie pie character proportionally sized compared to the cookie body and oriented in a way that suggests natural grip and movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatula held by the right-hand whoopie pie character is proportionately sized and is held in a way that suggests a natural grip. It appears as though the character is actively holding it for a purpose, such as preparing or serving, which is supported by its orientation in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the two whoopie pie characters peering over the edge of the plate positioned so that their lower halves remain below the plate’s edge, with no unnatural floating or cut-off limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the whoopie pie character on the right peering over the edge of the plate is drawn with its lower half below the plate's edge, while the left character is fully visible but does not appear to be floating or cut-off awkwardly. This positioning helps them maintain a sense of balance and correct interaction with the spatial environment in the cartoon.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the text bubble containing “I heard today’s flavor is mint! Let’s find it!” placed adjacent to the speaking character without overlapping critical features like eyes or limbs, and is the handwritten font clear and unblurred?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, text bubbles accompany the dialogue of the character, and despite a slight placement posture, there are Russian influences in the dialogue, indicating humor in the text rather than a direct quote of the question. The text bubbles in the image are placed next to the speaker and do not overlap with important parts like eyes or limbs. However, the handwritten text appears somewhat scribbled and may not be entirely clear, indicating a playful rather than a serious approach.",
