      "question": "Does the transition from the soil environment to the metallic climate-controlled cultivation chamber appear seamless and maintain the structural coherence of the carrot stem and leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot seamlessly transitions from the outdoor soil environment to the climate-controlled cultivation chamber without any visible disruption at the soil level. The carrot stem and leaves maintain their structural coherence, appearing healthy and intact amidst the synthetic substrate. The continuity of the carrot’s structure from the root to the stem suggests that the transition functionally works in the new setting without visual incongruities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the materials in the metallic climate-controlled cultivation chamber visually consistent with a realistic space greenhouse environment, avoiding unnatural texture or lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a metallic environment which is consistent with common depictions of space or controlled greenhouse environments. The lighting and textures within the chamber are appropriate and avoid creating an unnatural or artificial effect that would disrupt the realism of a space greenhouse setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the carrot retain its authentic orange color and smooth surface texture when placed in the synthetic substrate of the cultivation chamber?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot's vibrant orange color and smooth surface texture remain consistent with what is typically expected from a healthy carrot. Despite the synthetic substrate, these characteristics are preserved faithfully, indicating that the substrate does not distract from the carrot's natural appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the soil clumps around the carrot and the green leaves accurately reflected in the revised image without any noticeable loss of detail or presence of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The soil clumps in Image B exhibit detailed texture resembling real soil, with visible granularity and varied size characteristic of natural earth. Similarly, the carrot’s green leaves retain their sharpness and defined shape, allowing recognition of real plant leaves. The details are maintained without loss or unnatural textures compared to Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the scale and placement of the carrot within the cultivation chamber align naturally with the expected proportions in a space greenhouse setting, avoiding any distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the carrot placed centrally within the cultivation chamber, maintaining a natural size that aligns with realistic space greenhouse proportions. The carrot does not appear distorted and its dimensions are consistent with the expected size relative to the chamber parameters, ensuring no geometric distortion.",
