    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass display case appear transparent and free of unnatural textures or distortions that would make it look artificial?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the display case housing the dog statue appears transparent, as the edges are clearly visible and consistent in shape without any distortion. The glass exhibits natural reflections and refractions, indicating good transparency typical of real-life glass enclosures commonly used in museums. This assessment is based on the natural integration of the case's appearance driven by the visual cues of light interaction with glass surfaces, which is known to preserve transparency in real-world settings.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the light focused on the dogâ€™s face well-integrated with the environment, without introducing noticeable shadows or highlights that disrupt the scene?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is concentrated on the dog's face, achieving a well-balanced effect that harmonizes with the surroundings inside the display case. The light neither produces stark shadows nor overly harsh highlights, suggesting well-considered integration with the environment. Typically, museum display lighting aims to emphasize the object without diminishing other elements, a characteristic affirmed by the consistency of light and shadow distribution present here. Such lighting ensures visibility without disruption.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the dog remain proportionally consistent within the new museum exhibit setup, avoiding any distortion or deformation in its physical structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's proportions appear consistent and structurally sound, as indicated by the visible head, ears, and body shape fitting naturally within the display area. There are no evident signs of distortion or deformation, maintaining realistic dimensions. This adherence to proportionally accurate representation is crucial to ensuring objects retain their natural form when integrated into exhibits, a standard practice in preserving authenticity in such installations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the informational label about the breed and story appear naturally placed, with no jagged edges or abrupt transitions that suggest poor integration?",
    "explanation": "The label next to the glass case in Image B is well-integrated with the environment and appears naturally placed. The edges are smooth, and there are no abrupt transitions that suggest inconsistency or poor editing. This is crucial for maintaining a professional and polished appearance in museum settings, where labels need to be both informative and visually seamless.",
    "answer": "Yes"
