      "question": "Do the proportions of the shirt and tie appear natural and appropriate for the baby's body size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt and tie fit the baby in a way that visually suggests they are tailored for its size, which is uncommon for a baby but not impossible given tailored baby clothing exists. The shirt and tie's proportions seem exaggerated for dramatic effect but are in line with common styles when dressing babies in adult-like attire for humorous effect. Thus, the proportions appear appropriate relative to this style.",

      "question": "Are the textures of the shirt and tie smooth and consistent with typical fabric materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shirt and tie in Image B exhibit texture details such as natural creases and light reflections, common in smooth, fabric materials like cotton or polyester. The tie is smooth with a slight sheen, consistent with silk or satin ties. Thus, these characteristics are indicative of typical fabric materials used in clothing.",

      "question": "Do the baby's hands holding the glasses appear anatomically correct and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baby's hands grasping the glasses show natural, realistic positioning, resembling normal hand anatomy with correctly proportioned fingers and a plausible grip on the glasses. This indicates the hands are anatomically correct and free from noticeable distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the baby's posture and the way the clothes drape over the body look natural and believable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the baby seated with clothing draped in a way that conforms to its natural body shape, matching common postures for infants who are dressed in slightly oversized or adult-styled clothing. The folds and fall of the clothes suggest gravity and natural body structure influence them. Hence, the draping of clothes appears natural and believable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt, tie, and suit jacket show consistent seams and edges with no apparent signs of digital manipulation to suggest they are artificially placed on the baby. The rendered fabrics blend well with the body contours, and attention to detail minimizes any edit artifacts.",
