      "question": "Does the bowl maintain a clean, semi-transparent appearance without any unnatural textures or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bowl appears to have a glowing edge which gives it a semi-transparent appearance. The geometric shape of the bowl is maintained consistently without any breaks or unnatural textures. Such a glowing effect may not be entirely consistent with natural appearances but does not introduce broken shapes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the carrots and cauliflower looks smooth and somewhat glossy, as if fresh and slightly damp. The details like the texture of the cauliflower florets and the edges of the carrot slices are well-defined, indicating no loss of fine details.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the reflections and soft shadows on the vegetables and bowl accurately depicted without causing any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflections on the bowl and shading on the vegetables in Image B seem to be stylized with a soft glow effect. While this effect adds a unique visual appeal, it somewhat deviates from natural reflection and shadow patterns. However, the transitions are smooth and do not cause any distortions, just adding a slightly surreal effect.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carrots and cauliflower in Image B have rich colors; the orange of the carrots and the white of the cauliflower are vibrant but not excessively so. They retain their natural appearance without appearing overly saturated or washed out.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a smooth, neutral gray which provides a simple contrast to the vibrant colors of the vegetables. It does not include any patterns or distractions, allowing the focus to remain on the bowl.",
