      "question": "Are the branches of the tree composed of clean, angular geometric lines consistent with Art Deco style, without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree branches exhibit clean and angular geometric lines typical of the Art Deco style. The lines are straight or gently curved, meeting at precise angles, which is characteristic of this artistic movement. There are no visible jagged edges or unnatural breaks in these lines, indicating a consistent geometric approach to the tree design. This contrasts with Image A, where the tree's branches are depicted more naturally, with organic curves and irregularities. The transformation in Image B utilizes geometric abstraction typical in visual art reflecting Art Deco's influence.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the grass in the foreground display muted, uniform coloration with preserved textural details such as individual blades or soft gradients, rather than appearing uniformly flat or artificially colored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area that would correspond to the grass is part of a stained glass style and, as such, does not depict individual blades or detailed texture. Instead, it consists of large, uniform segments typical of stained glass art. The coloration appears flat and is limited to broad areas filled with specific colors, without nuanced textural detail. This is a significant departure from Image A, where the grass shows natural texture and gradient colors indicating the presence of individual blades. Therefore, the grass does not display preserved textural details but rather an artistically simplified version.",

      "question": "Are the mountain silhouettes composed of defined angular planes in bronze and teal tones, maintaining layered depth and spatial consistency without overlapping or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain silhouettes are represented using clear, angular planes typical of a stained glass design. The colors used are bronze and teal tones, which help create an illusion of depth through color contrast and distinct shapes. These components maintain spatial consistency and do not show any overlapping or disjointed floating sections, aligning seamlessly within the stained glass framework. This contrasts with Image A, where the mountains are depicted with more natural contours and shading, creating a realistic landscape depth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the sky feature a smooth gradient from dark at the top to lighter near the horizon, with thin, evenly spaced accent lines that follow the curvature of the scene without intersecting or distorting the starfield?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky does not feature a gradient or accent lines as described. Instead, it maintains a characteristic style of stained glass, where large sections are uniformly colored rather than featuring gradual gradients. The design does not visually indicate thin or evenly spaced accent lines; instead, it exhibits partitions relevant to stained glass art. This is distinct from Image A, where the sky likely features a natural gradient from dark to light, typical of a natural horizon effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all elements—tree, mountains, and sky—rendered with consistent stained glass-style outlines and fills, lacking transparent patches, misaligned edges, or inconsistent shading within the same layer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all components—the tree, mountains, and sky—are rendered with the uniformity characteristic of stained glass style. The outlines are thick and consistent, and the fills are solid with no transparent patches, ensuring no misalignment among parts. The colors are consistent within each segment or panel, and the defined partitions yield uniform shading across the respective elements. This uniformity is characteristic of stained glass design and contrasts strongly with the realistic texture and shading in Image A.",
