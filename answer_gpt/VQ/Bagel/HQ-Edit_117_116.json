    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the wings display a smooth, translucent gradient resembling flowing water without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural banding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings of the creature in Image B exhibit smooth gradients that transition seamlessly between colors, primarily in shades of blue and green. The edges are soft, without pixelation or jagged lines, and the colors blend naturally, creating the appearance of flowing water. This suggests that the wings were designed with careful attention to color transitions and edge quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scales on the dragonfly’s body evenly distributed, aligned with its natural segmentation, and do they exhibit smooth color transitions without abrupt edges or repetitive patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an entirely different creature, as opposed to a dragonfly seen in Image A. The blue creature has a textured body with patterns resembling scales, which are evenly distributed and appear consistent with the segmentation of the creature’s body. The colors transition smoothly across the body without abrupt edges or repetitive patterns, reflecting a careful design intended to mimic organic scaling.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the eyes retain their spherical shape and contain layered, dark blue internal structures that suggest depth, without appearing flattened or unnaturally textured?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's eyes are prominently spherical and feature layered dark blue patterns. These dimensions and texturing create a sense of depth, as if staring into a complex internal structure. The careful rendering avoids a flat appearance and highlights a focus on realism within the fantastical design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the aquatic vines wrapped around the dragonfly’s legs in a continuous, non-intersecting manner, with a soft glowing edge that does not bleed into surrounding areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image focuses on a creature surrounded by curving aquatic vines, but they do not wrap around its appendages or resemble the dragonfly’s natural environment. The vines exhibit a glowing quality but remain distinct from the creature without intersecting or continuous wrapping. The glow is controlled without spilling excessively into adjacent areas.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mist evenly diffused around the dragonfly, fading gradually into the air without sharp edges, clumping, or unnatural brightness spikes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no dragonfly, and the environment features an underwater scene with soft lighting. This ambiance does not include mist but exhibits evenly diffused light enhancing the underwater effect. Since mist is not part of Image B’s features, this question’s criteria cannot be assessed directly relative to any mist in the environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the reflection in the water accurately depict the edited dragonfly’s features, including wings, body patterns, and vines, with appropriate distortion and reduced brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any dragonfly reflection because it depicts an underwater creature rather than a dragonfly above water. There is no water surface or reflection present, so the criteria regarding water reflection applied here are unrelated to the image content. Therefore, the question does not correspond with the features visible in Image B.",
