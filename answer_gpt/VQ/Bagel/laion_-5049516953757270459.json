    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the LEGO representation of the avocado half retain a smooth, curved appearance with consistent brick alignment along its edge, avoiding jagged or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the avocado half is represented using LEGO bricks, which are inherently blocky and cannot achieve a perfectly smooth or curved edge. The bricks create a more angular and fragmented look, departing from the smooth consistency seen in a real avocado. This is contrasted with Image A, where the avocado half has naturally smooth and curved edges. Therefore, the avocado's representation in LEGO does not maintain a smooth appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blueberries and raspberries represented with uniformly sized round LEGO bricks that maintain their individual spherical form without flattening or merging into irregular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO representation of blueberries and raspberries using variously colored bricks. Instead of spherical forms, they appear blocky, which results in a loss of the individual spherical appearance, contrasting with Image A's display of natural, rounded berries. The use of rectangular LEGO bricks makes it challenging to replicate spherical forms accurately.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the LEGO broccoli maintain a layered, tree-like branching structure with distinct florets, avoiding overly simplified or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli is depicted using LEGO bricks, which, due to their blocky nature, simplify the structure substantially. The tree-like branching and distinct florets evident in natural broccoli, as seen in Image A, are reduced with LEGO bricks into a more simplified geometry without distinct layering and branching.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the surface of the LEGO red bell pepper smoothly curved with tightly fitted bricks, showing no visible gaps or abrupt angular transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO representation in Image B is composed of interlocked bricks, which introduces angular transitions and visible separations between elements. Real bell peppers in Image A are naturally smooth and curved, which the LEGO version cannot replicate due to its geometric limitations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the outer edge of the LEGO heart-shaped board follow the exact contour of the original wooden board without deviations, breaks, or irregularities in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The heart-shaped board in Image B uses LEGO and cannot match the smooth contour of the original wooden board seen in Image A. The LEGO composition results in slight deviations and an irregular shape due to the angular nature of bricks versus the smooth curves of wood.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the LEGO asparagus stalks aligned in parallel and bound together by a LEGO representation of twine, preserving the original bundle's structure and proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses LEGO blocks, which makes replicating thin and parallel asparagus stalks challenging. The alignment and proportion of the original in Image A are hard to preserve due to the blocky constraints. Also, creating twine-like structures with LEGO doesn't offer the same binding detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the LEGO heart-shaped board placed on a uniform gray base with no visible shadows, highlights, or texture inconsistencies that suggest mismatched lighting or depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO heart-shaped board is set against a gray background that appears uniform, with no obvious shadows or lighting inconsistencies notable in the image. This maintains a flat and homogeneous look, contrasting with potential variations seen in Image A's wooden surface.",
