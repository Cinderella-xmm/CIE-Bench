      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the long flowing robe have natural fabric draping and folds that follow the contours of the body without unnatural stretching or clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe worn by the character has gentle folds and drapes naturally over the seated figure, forming realistic contours without appearing stretched or clumped in any area. This observation aligns with common knowledge of how fabric typically behaves when draped over a body in a seated position, showcasing a natural flow thanks to the way the fabricâ€™s texture interacts with gravity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the limbs and joints of the seated figure anatomically correct, with no distorted angles or disproportionate lengths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seated figure in Image B shows limbs and joints that are smoothly integrated into the character's overall pose. The arms rest naturally on the lap, and the legs are positioned in a seated stance, indicating proportions and angles that are consistent with chibi-style illustrations where anatomical precision is expressed through simplified features.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes significantly larger than normal but still proportionally integrated into the face without distorting surrounding facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a character with disproportionately large eyes, characteristic of chibi-style art, yet they fit within the proportions of the face well. The eyes are drawn in a way that highlights expressiveness but does not interfere with the structure of other facial features, a common stylistic choice in cartoon art forms prioritizing cuteness and expression.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the mountain and lake reflections exhibit soft, blended watercolor transitions without sharp edges or artificial-looking brush strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of mountains and their reflections in the lake uses a watercolor technique, characterized by soft transitions and gentle blending, instead of harsh lines or overly defined brush strokes. This technique provides a serene and picturesque backdrop, typical in stylized art where realism is conveyed through color and form harmony.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lilac-edged border uniformly applied around the image without overlapping or obscuring any part of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lilac-edged border surrounding Image B is applied consistently and uniformly, maintaining a safe distance from the main illustration. It frames the artwork effectively without interfering with or covering any part of the scene, emphasizing the inside content while maintaining a distinct boundary.",
