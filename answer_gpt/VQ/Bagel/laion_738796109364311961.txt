    "Question": "Q1: Are the muscle proportions of the player in red (player #24) exaggerated but still anatomically plausible without visible distortion or unnatural bulging?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the muscle proportions of the player in red are exaggerated in a stylized manner typical of cartoon or caricature illustration styles. The muscles are represented with bold outlines and shading, giving them a more rounded and prominent appearance. However, they maintain plausible anatomy with no visible distortions or unnatural bulging that break the typical human muscle structure. The illustration presents a stylized form that remains within the bounds of anatomical possibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the uniform colors of both players retain natural color gradients and material textures despite increased vibrancy, without appearing oversaturated or flat?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the uniform colors of both players appear more vibrant and saturated compared to Image A. Despite this increase in vibrancy, the colors do not appear oversaturated or flat. The illustration uses bold colors typical of cartoon art and manages to maintain a level of shading and gradient that reflects the natural material textures. While the depiction is abstract, the color contrast and shading give the uniforms a convincing appearance rather than a flat or overly simplified look.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the team logos on both players' helmets and jerseys accurately rendered and properly aligned without deformation or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the team logos on the players' helmets and jerseys are simplified as part of the illustration style but retain enough detail to be recognizable. The positioning of the logos on the helmets and jerseys is consistent with the natural alignment in sports uniforms, without visible deformation or pixelation. This adherence to correct positioning and clarity even in a stylized form ensures the logos remain identifiable and aligned correctly.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the background behind the players stylistically enhanced but still coherent with the foreground, without sudden distortions or loss of detail in the crowd or field markings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is rendered in a simplified illustrative style typical of situations where the focus is on the central characters. While stylized, it maintains coherence with the foreground, showing an audience and environmental markings that match the sporting context. There is no sudden distortion or loss of detail that distracts from the main action, allowing the viewer to infer a sports setting while remaining focused on the players.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the limbs and body postures of both players maintain structural consistency with real-world biomechanics, even with exaggerated motion, without broken joints or floating limbs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs and body postures of both players are exaggerated in motion for the purpose of the cartoon illustration. Despite this exaggeration, the body structures remain consistent with real-world biomechanics, with no evidence of broken joints or floating limbs. The limbs are appropriately connected to the body in anatomically plausible positions that convey action and movement effectively.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the matte black collector's box with transparent lid visually consistent in material, lighting, and perspective, and does it surround the cards without introducing edge artifacts or lighting mismatches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the matte black collector's box with a transparent lid is depicted clearly and consistently in terms of material and lighting. The illustration shows a coherent perspective that aligns with the enclosed cards, and the edges are clean without visible artifacts. The lighting is consistent with how the transparent lid and black box should appear, maintaining the overall visual harmony and avoiding mismatches.",
    "answer": "Yes"
