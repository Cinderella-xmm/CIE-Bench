      "question": "Does the gold wavy hair enamel pin on the head have smooth, continuous curves without jagged edges or distorted proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the enamel pin representing gold wavy hair is designed to have smooth, flowing lines to replicate the softness of hair in an artistic form. This design is common in enamel pins as they often aim to replicate an idealized version of their subject. By observing the pin's curves and their fluidity, it can be determined if they are smooth and continuous, which they appear to be. This suggests well-crafted artwork, common in well-made enamel pins.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the pink fur-textured enamel pin on the shoulder rendered with a consistent glossy finish and no visible fibrous or organic texture that contradicts its intended material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an enamel pin posed as if representing a pink fur texture. Enamel pins are typically designed to have smooth, glossy surfaces due to the nature of the materials used (enamel over metal). If the pin exhibits a consistent glossy finish without the fibrous details typically associated with actual fur, it aligns with what is expected from an enamel product. The pin's smooth surface indicates a uniform glossy finish that matches this expectation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lines of the minimalist outline enamel pin complete, evenly spaced, and free from broken segments or irregular curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the minimalist outline enamel pin depicts hair in stylized form. Such pins commonly feature outlines that are uniform and continuous to maintain an overall polished look. By examining the pin, its lines seem evenly spaced and without breaks or irregular features, maintaining an aesthetically clean appearance and indicative of quality craftsmanship in enamel work.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all three enamel pins exhibit consistent glossiness and color intensity without visible noise, halos, or uneven shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, all three enamel pins — representing gold, pink, and minimalist outlined hair — visually maintain a consistent gloss and vibrant color. This homogeneity is typical of enamel pins which use baked enamel for uniform color application. If there is no visual distortion like noise, halos, or shading irregularities, they fulfill the standard expectations of enamel craftsmanship.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the three enamel pins positioned such that they appear to rest on the subject’s head and shoulder without intersecting through skin or appearing detached from the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, three enamel pins seem to be designed to rest naturally on the subject's head and shoulder areas. Proper placement would mean the pins align logically with the subject’s body contours without floating inconsistently or seeming to pierce the skin, which they appear to do well. This suggests an intent to mimic actual placement and integration with character features in a realistic manner.",
