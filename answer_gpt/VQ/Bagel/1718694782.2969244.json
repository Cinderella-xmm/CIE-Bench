      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the motion lines surrounding the character in Panel 1 smoothly aligned with the direction of motion and free from jagged edges or inconsistent spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motion lines in a comic or animated panel are typically drawn to emphasize the movement of the character. In Panel 1 of Image B, these lines should appear naturally aligned with the character's trajectory as they leap off the ledge. Upon examining the image, the lines are smoothly integrated, following the angle of the character's movement towards the right and downward. The lines are evenly spaced and free from abrupt breaks or jagged edges, which ensures the fluid representation of motion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the internal monologue bubble positioned close to the character’s head without overlapping facial features or distorting the character’s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comics, speech or thought bubbles are placed strategically to avoid interference with the character's facial features or overall outline, ensuring the narrative remains clear. In Panel 1 of Image B, the internal monologue bubble is located above and slightly to the left of the character's head. It does not overlap with the character's body or distort their outline, maintaining a clear separation between the character and the text.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sky background in Panel 1 display a smooth gradient from warm to cool tones without visible color bands or unnatural transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A smooth gradient in artwork usually involves a seamless transition from one color to another without distinct lines or bands of color differences. In Panel 1 of Image B, the sky background transitions from warmer colors (like oranges and pinks) near the horizon to cooler tones (like blues) higher in the sky. This transition appears smooth, with no discernible bands or abrupt color changes, which effectively mimics a natural sky at sunset.",

      "question": "Is the parachute in Panel 2 correctly shaped, proportionally sized relative to the character, and connected by visible cords that extend logically from the character’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parachute's depiction in animation should maintain realistic proportions and show a logical connection to the character to reflect functionality. In Panel 2 of Image B, the parachute is ballooned open with a shape consistent with a typical parachute design. It appears proportionally larger than the character, as it should be, and the cords are clearly drawn, visually extending from the character's backpack, indicating proper attachment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the animated clouds in both panels appear as distinct volumetric forms with soft edges and no clipping into the character or mountain silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Clouds in animated graphics should appear as cohesive, round-edged forms to convey volume without overlapping or 'clipping' through other foreground elements like characters or mountains. In both panels of Image B, the clouds are depicted with rounded, soft edges, suggesting volume and depth. They maintain a clear separation from the character and mountain silhouettes, ensuring the scene remains visually coherent and uncluttered.",
