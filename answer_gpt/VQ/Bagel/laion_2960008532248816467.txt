    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes and smile drawn on the yellow surface of the front tart smooth, consistent in color with the surrounding custard, and free from jagged edges or unnatural texture disruptions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and smile are clearly drawn on the yellow surface of the tart. The design includes facial features with smooth outlines and colors that match the yellow of the custard, indicating a consistent integration. There are no visible jagged edges or texture disruptions, implying a smooth and playful design, consistent with cartoon style. Common cartoon design ensures that features such as eyes and smile are smooth and match the aesthetics of the surrounding elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the forest creatures on the crust rim appear proportionally small, properly aligned with the curve of the crust, and have soft, coherent textures without visible pixelation or clipping artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The forest creatures in Image B are placed on the crust rim and appear proportionally small in comparison to the tart. They are depicted in a cartoon style with features properly aligned to the crust’s curve. Their textures appear smooth and coherent, fitting the soft illustrative style of the image without any visible pixelation or clipping artifacts. Cartoon illustrations often prioritize smoothness and consistency in character design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the swirling path extend smoothly from the base of the front tart into the background, with consistent shading and perspective, and without sharp edges or floating segments?",
    "explanation": "The pathway in Image B transitions from the front tart into the backdrop smoothly. It has consistent shading and maintains perspective coherence, which gives the image depth and realism despite its cartoon style. There are no visible sharp edges or floating parts, ensuring that the path appears naturally integrated into the scene. Such smooth integration is typical in carefully composed illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the green foliage and pastel flowers positioned around the tart at a realistic distance, with proper shadowing and no overlapping or clipping onto the tart’s body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the foliage and flowers are positioned around the tart, distributed at a visually pleasing distance that feels natural within the cartoon landscape. The cartoon aesthetic doesn’t require realistic shadowing but maintains a harmonious distribution of elements without overlapping or clipping onto the tart’s body. These elements are playing well within the artistic style, maintaining clear separations between them and the tart.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the two tarts retain their original shape, size, and layered structure (crust, custard, top glaze), with only non-destructive additions applied, and are there no distortions such as warped edges or missing layers?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tarts are stylized and depicted in a cartoon form, which differs visually from Image A. However, they retain their conceptual structure including crust and custard. The cartoon interpretation includes artistic liberties but ensures a recognizable shape of a tart. The adaptations are illustrative, with non-destructive changes consistent with the cartoon theme of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
