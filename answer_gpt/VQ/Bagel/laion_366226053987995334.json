      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) on the feather earrings proportionally sized and seamlessly integrated into the feather surface without distorting the engraved lines or creating unnatural texture contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features such as eyes and mouth are part of an anthropomorphized character drawn onto a feather-like shape, resembling a cartoon. The engraved lines typical of a feather are not present, as the drawing style does not aim to replicate a real feather but instead presents a whimsical, cartoonish design with bold outlines and exaggerated expressions. Thus, the facial features do not integrate into a feather surface in a realistic way, and there aren't typical engraved lines to distort.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central black oval stone on each feather preserved and unobscured by the added facial features, and do the engraved lines of the feather remain symmetrical and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a cartoon-like character with a facial expression incorporated into the design. The design doesn't showcase a central oval stone as seen in Image A, but rather uses the cartoon's eyes as a focal point. The concept of an oval stone surrounded by engraved feather lines is replaced by a stylized character aesthetics. Therefore, the stone is not preserved or unobscured as it is nonexistent in this depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a visible and logically connected arm-like extension from one earring to the other, suggesting motion, and are both earrings still properly attached to their hooks without floating or detachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a drawn connection between two anthropomorphic entities mimicking earrings, with one character extending its tongue towards the other, adding a sense of playful interaction. This is not an arm-like extension between two earrings in the usual sense but a part of the character design. There are no indications of hooks or attachment mechanisms akin to typical earrings, as the concept is entirely abstract and cartoon-based.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text bubble positioned near the head of the anthropomorphic earring, clearly legible, and free from overlapping or covering essential details of the earrings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cartoon representation of Image B, a text bubble appears close to one character's head, written in a comic style. However, due to its stylistic font, the text is not fully legible ('LET'S SOOR NEW NEW HDETOA!!'), and while it does not obscure critical character details, it reflects the overall abstract and humorous theme rather than focusing on legibility or maintenance of earring details.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bold outlines follow the exact contours of the earrings without gaps or misalignment, and are the vibrant colors applied consistently without pixelation, blurring, or loss of fine engraved details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of bold outlines is more towards a cartoon character depiction than following the actual contour of earrings from Image A. The outlines and colors fit the cartoon style, focusing on character exaggeration rather than fine detailing or realistic representation. The colors are applied consistently as per the theme, but the detailed engraved characteristics of earrings are not retained in this cartoon style where pixelation or blurring would typically appear. The character depiction does not necessitate exact adherence to contour or engraved detail preservation.",
