    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features on the frame near the handlebars seamlessly integrated with the red surface, showing no visible seams, texture mismatch, or color artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are added onto the frame near the handlebars as part of a cartoon design. The integration of these features seems well executed; they appear to be part of the frame's surface, with cohesive color and texture that matches the rest of the bike. There are no visible seams or texture mismatches evident in the edited image. Common knowledge of cartoon illustrations suggests that successful integration would avoid jagged edges or color mismatches.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the cartoon limbs extend from the hub centers without distorting the wheel rims, spokes, or hub components?",
    "explanation": "The cartoon limbs in Image B extend from around the hub area, but upon closer observation, they appear to be positioned without causing distortion to the wheel rims, spokes, or hub components. Cartoon-style illustrations typically allow for additional creative elements without interfering with structural integrity. Analysis shows that the limbs are drawn to coexist with the existing bike elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the motion lines positioned along the sides of the bike and angled forward, without crossing over the chain, derailleur, or “DUCATI” logo?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes motion lines that suggest speed and movement, a common technique in comic illustrations to imply action. These lines are positioned to the sides and above the bike, angled forward in a way that does not interfere with the chain, derailleur, or any branding such as the 'DUCATI' logo. There is no overlap with these components, adhering to a clean composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the frame retain its original tubular structure and dimensional consistency despite the added hero suit design, with no bulges, collapses, or incorrect curvature?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bike frame incorporates a hero suit design which alters its appearance to include cartoon elements. Despite these additions, the fundamental tubular structure of the bike frame appears to be preserved. There are no visible bulges, collapses, or incorrect curvature in the frame's design - the edited design manages to maintain structural coherence expected in bike frames.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the sound effect texts positioned outside the main structural components of the bike and oriented in a way that suggests movement, without obscuring the “DUCATI” branding or control levers?",
    "explanation": "Sound effect texts in Image B like 'VPON!', 'YROON!', and 'ZOON!' are positioned around the bike, typical of comic art to express dynamic action. They are placed outside the structural components of the bike such as frame and wheels, not interfering with any branding like 'DUCATI' or control levers. Placement and orientation effectively suggest movement while preserving visibility of key bike elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
