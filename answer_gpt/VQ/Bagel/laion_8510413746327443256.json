    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the holographic dragon eye on the watch face exhibit smooth gradients and consistent lighting without pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural glow artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic dragon eye on the watch face in Image B is characterized by smooth gradients and consistent lighting, particularly evident in the glow effect surrounding the eye and the detailed iris design. The transitions between colors are seamless, and there are no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or abnormalities in the glow. This suggests the image was rendered or edited with high attention to detail, ensuring a natural and polished appearance based on typical digital art standards.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the silver scales on the band evenly aligned, properly shaded, and free from gaps or overlapping segments that break geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silver scales on the dragon depicted in Image B are visually evenly aligned and consistently shaded, which contributes to a cohesive and smooth geometric continuity. The sculpted texture maintains alignment without noticeable gaps or overlaps, giving it a harmonious appearance which aligns with typical well-executed digital illustrations of mechanical or biomechanical designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glowing neural node on the side of the watch case properly integrated with the casing, showing consistent illumination and no unnatural light leakage or distortion in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a dragon design where elements like the glowing eye can be considered analogous to a neural node. The integration of such glowing elements with the surrounding structure shows consistent illumination, and the glow effect does not exhibit unnatural light leakage or distortion in shape. This implies that the digital rendering considers both lighting and structural integration thoroughly, adhering to common practices in creating visually appealing lighting effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the luminescent control sigils on the watch face maintain clear boundaries and consistent brightness levels without blurring or ghosting around their edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while it doesn't directly depict control sigils as seen on a watch, the luminescent effect around the dragon's eye serves a similar function of maintaining visual clarity. The glow maintains clear boundaries and consistent brightness without any signs of blurring or ghosting, suggesting a high level of precision in lighting adjustment typically achieved in digital artwork.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all components of the watch—case, band, crown, and side button—proportionally aligned and structurally coherent without visible warping, stretching, or misplacement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, the dragon in Image B represents a conceptual transition from the original watch. The dragon's body and features like its scales are proportionally aligned and give a sense of structural coherence, free from visible warping, stretching, or misplacement. This reflects similar digital design principles where artwork components are crafted to fit proportionally within the imagined context.",
