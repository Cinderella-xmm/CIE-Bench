    "Question": "Q1: Does the metallic statue have five fingers on each hand, with natural joint angles and smooth surface transitions, and no visible seams or distorted geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic part that could be considered as fingers on the statue does not clearly display five distinct fingers due to the design. The structure appears metaphorical rather than anatomically accurate. Therefore, we cannot confirm five fingers with natural joint angles.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the leaves of the miniature trees semi-transparent, allowing light to pass through them, and positioned at a distance from the statue that matches their reduced scale without overlapping the figure unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays miniature tree models within the glass dome, which appear to be constructed from a woven or mesh material. This gives them a semi-transparent look, and they are arranged within the dome to showcase a scale that suits their environment without overlapping with other elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the engraved plaques flush with the base surface, with readable text and consistent depth, and do they follow the contour of the pedestal without appearing detached or warped?",
    "explanation": "The plaques in Image B are detailed enough to show engraving, but due to the angle and lighting, it is challenging to determine their depth and flushness with precision. However, they do not appear detached or warped, maintaining consistency with the pedestal's contour.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the glass dome fully transparent with smooth, continuous curvature, showing accurate reflections of nearby objects and sky, and free from jagged edges or internal distortions?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears highly transparent, allowing a clear view of the contents inside. Its curvature is smooth, and it does not show any noticeable jagged edges or distortions, reflecting an environment and objects around it realistically.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the dome stand feature a polished stone surface with subtle texture variation, and are the vine patterns clearly defined, following natural growth patterns without breaking or repeating unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dome stand shows a polished stone surface with some texture variations. The vine patterns are artistically drawn, following a naturalistic pattern without noticeable breaks or repetition, enhancing the aesthetic of the stand.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the glass dome positioned above the statue and base without clipping through any part of the figure or pedestal, and does it rest securely on the dome stand without floating or tilting?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B is positioned directly above the base, fitting appropriately without any overlap or clipping through the pedestal or figure. It rests securely on the stand, maintaining a balanced and steady appearance without any sign of floating or tilting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
