      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the kernel wearing autumn attire maintain consistent size and texture with real corn kernels, and does the clothing appear seamlessly integrated without visible edges or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kernel is depicted with cartoonish attributes, specifically wearing autumn attire, like a hat and coat. Compared to real corn kernels, which are small and have a consistent texture and shape, the kernel character in Image B is stylized and larger. This character does not maintain the consistent size and texture with real corn kernels as its design is more playful and exaggerated. The clothing of the kernel appears well-integrated into the cartoonish design, which matches the overall theme but not the real corn characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the energy lines emanating from the popcorn pieces smooth and consistent with the direction of motion, and do they avoid intersecting or distorting the popcorn shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the energy lines are depicted surrounding a cartoon poppin' pumpkin illustration. These energy lines provide a dynamic effect consistent with cartoon animation styles. The lines appear smooth and enhance the motion effect without intersecting or distorting the popcorn shapes, contributing to the visual dynamic of the illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the popcorn piece with the explorer hat properly scaled and textured, and do the spices and pumpkin elements adjacent to it appear naturally positioned without overlapping distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The popcorn piece depicted with an explorer hat in Image B is appropriately scaled to fit within the cartoonish context. The overall texture matches the style seen throughout the edited image. There are adjacent spices and pumpkin elements depicted with faces that appear naturally positioned in the context of the playful design, and these elements do not overlap or distort each other visually.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the popcorn pieces entering the ceramic bowls follow a downward trajectory consistent with gravity, and do they remain within the bowl boundaries without appearing to float above or clip through the rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon bowls receiving popcorn show that the popcorn is depicted in a way that simulates a pouring action or movement towards the bowls. The pieces appear to follow a consistent trajectory with the placement within the visual style, appearing as if they are placed inside the bowls without obvious clipping or floating effects relative to bowl boundaries.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the added elements (such as hats, energy lines, and spices) consistent with the original orange-brown theme, and do they lack over-saturation or color bleeding at edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hats, energy lines, and spice elements follow a consistent color scheme within the illustrationâ€™s theme. The orange and brown colors maintain a cohesive pallet without appearing overstated or bleeding past the edges that define cartoon features. It aligns well with the intended playful and autumn-themed color scheme.",
