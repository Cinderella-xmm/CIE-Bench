      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of all four figures covered in soft-looking fabric with consistent, non-repeating bold patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow, and do they lack visible seams, pixelation, or artificial textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the items displayed are plush toy fish, which are indeed covered in soft-looking fabric. They have bold and colorful patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow with non-repeating designs. The fabric appears seamless and free from pixelation or artificial textures, which is typical for plush toys designed for visual appeal and tactile interaction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the legs and arms of all four figures morph into exaggerated fins and tails in a way that maintains their original dynamic poses without broken geometry or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects are designed as fish plush toys and naturally have fins and tails, as opposed to legs and arms. The form of plush toys inherently does not have human-like limbs to morph or pose dynamically, but rather are artistically crafted to resemble fish with realistic proportions for a soft toy. Therefore, they maintain their aesthetic design as fish without the need for dynamic poses like the figures in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the weapons of each figure been reimagined as integrated fish-like features (such as fins or tail extensions) without floating or misaligned components that break physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects are purely fish plush toys without any weaponry incorporated. The design logic of these toys does not align with the concept of weapons being reimagined as part of a fish anatomy. They are straightforwardly designed to look like colorful fish without elements from the figures in Image A being transformed into fish-like features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a textured sandy fabric surface with subtle shading and depth, and are all four figures positioned naturally on it without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B indeed resembles a textured fabric that appears sandy in color, providing a suitable base for displaying items like the plush toys. The toys are positioned naturally on this surface without any indication of floating or clipping, offering a cohesive presentation. The shading and fabric details add to the perceived depth, enhancing the visual presentation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands of each figure retain a natural number of fingers (no more than five), maintain ergonomic grip positions, and show no signs of deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents fish plush toys, which by design do not possess hands or fingers, therefore the condition of the hands with a natural number of fingers or ergonomic grip positions is not applicable. This contrasts with Image A, where the figures have discernable hand-like structures.",
