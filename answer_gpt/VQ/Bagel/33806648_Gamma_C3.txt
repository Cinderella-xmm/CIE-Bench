    "Question": "Q1: Do the skeletal wing-like extensions emerge naturally from the rock arch's edges without gaps, floating sections, or unnatural angles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the additions of the skeletal wing-like extensions are intended to appear integrated into the rock arch structure. By scrutinizing the proximity of these extensions to the rock and considering their angles, they appear as deliberate design features on the added creature rather than extensions of the rock itself. Instead of emerging organically from the arch, they seem to be components of an otherworldly entity inserted into the scene. These extensions are attached to the creature and do not emerge directly from the rock's edges naturally, highlighting gaps and unnatural angles.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the crystalline growths along the arch’s curve textured and colored to blend with the surrounding rock, avoiding excessive gloss or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B for crystalline growth along the arch, we notice bright blue glowing veins and runic-like symbols on the creature. These elements stand out starkly from their surroundings due to their bright glow and contrasting color, which distinctly separate them from the surrounding rock textures. The absence of crystalline features blending naturally indicates these are deliberately highlighted features on the creature rather than textural modifications of the arch.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the glowing veins across the surface follow natural mineral-like patterns and have soft, continuous light emission without jagged edges or blocky artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Observing the glowing veins in Image B reveals a design that simulates a smooth and continuous light emission. These glowing patterns on the creature’s form are intricate, with a steady illumination that mimics organic glowing mineral veins. They lack any jagged edges or unnatural blocky artifacts, implying a thoughtful integration and design intended to mimic continuous organic patterns.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the runic symbols on the inner surface of the arch carved into the rock with consistent depth and shadow, matching the texture of natural erosion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, runic symbols are prominently featured as a part of the creature's body and are glowing with a bright blue light. These symbols are not etched into the rock arch or its surface. Instead, they are stylistically integrated on the creature itself and not related to the rock's texture or properties, meaning there is no depth or shadow corresponding with natural erosion.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the radiant orb emit light that matches the ambient lighting direction and creates realistic soft shadows and reflections on adjacent rock surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the radiant orb located in the center of the creature emits a bright light distinct from the natural ambient lighting. The contrasting blue glow does cast some light on nearby parts of the creature; however, it does not match the direction or nature of the natural light present in the original setting. This light source is distinctively separate from any lighting effects brought by sunlight or ambient light, failing to produce realistic shadows that align with the natural scene.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the ground textures, cracks, and soil near the base of the arch preserved and not obscured or distorted by the added elements?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, we see that the base of the arch and the ground textures are largely preserved despite the added elements. Although the creature is placed within the scene, its lower portion, which interacts with the ground, is carefully integrated, preserving the textural fidelity of the surface. The original ground textures, cracks, and natural soil features remain visible and unobstructed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
