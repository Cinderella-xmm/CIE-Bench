    "Question": "Q1: Does the text 'Catch the Wave' appear to blend naturally with the sky without introducing any unnatural textures or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Catch the Wave' is placed against the sky at the top of the image. Analyzing the image, the text is bold and distinct, with a shadow that creates a 3D effect. This effect is commonly used for adding visual interest. Since there are no visible artifacts such as pixelation or color distortion around the text, and it doesn't disrupt the sky's natural gradient, it can be concluded that the text does blend naturally.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the placement of 'Catch the Wave' maintain the structural integrity of the horizon and waves, avoiding any visual distortion?",
    "explanation": "The 'Catch the Wave' text is placed in the sky area above the horizon line. Analyzing Image B, the horizon and waves remain undistorted, with clear delineation between the text and the background image elements. The placement of the text does not interfere with the natural lines of the landscape, so the structural integrity is maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the 'Summer Adventures – 2025' note clearly legible and aligned naturally within the bottom-left sand area, without disrupting the beach's texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Summer Adventures – 2025' text is visible in the lower-left corner against the sand. The text has a shadow effect and is placed on a subtle background that aids its visibility while blending with the sand. The sand texture is not disrupted; thus, the text is legible, and its integration appears natural within the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do both the 'Catch the Wave' text and 'Summer Adventures – 2025' note seem logically placed and contextually appropriate within the beach scene, contributing positively to the overall visual narrative?",
    "explanation": "Both text elements in Image B are contextually appropriate. 'Catch the Wave' being large and prominent at the top aligns with promotional or thematic expressions often used for surfing or beach adventures. 'Summer Adventures – 2025' at the bottom, correlating with the scene of two people ready to surf, reinforces the beach and adventure theme. These placements logically relate to typical poster or promotional content for outdoor activities and enhance storytelling.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the shadows and light effects around the 'Catch the Wave' text and 'Summer Adventures – 2025' note consistent with the lighting in the rest of the image, preserving the natural appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both text elements use shadow effects to create a 3D and slightly elevated appearance. The overall lighting in the image shows a sunny beach scene, with shadows falling consistent with a light source from the upper right. The effects around the texts, with shadows and contrast, match the light and shadow work in the whole scene, avoiding any inconsistencies with the light direction of the beach environment, thus preserving the natural look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
