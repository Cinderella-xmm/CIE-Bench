      "question": "Does the velvet and brocade material on the garment display realistic fabric texture with appropriate highlights and shadows, and no repeating or pixelated patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the garment worn by the subject is depicted with a richly detailed design reminiscent of velvet and brocade materials. This is identified by observing the elaborate gold embroidery and smooth texture that suggests the plush, rich quality of these fabrics. Highlights and shadows appear to be appropriately placed along the contours of the fabric, giving it a realistic three-dimensional look without visible pixellation or repetitive patterns. World knowledge of how light interacts with such materials supports this interpretation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ruffled collar properly attached to the neckline, showing natural fold patterns, and does the gold embroidery follow continuous, coherent lines without broken or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ruffled collar in Image B is shown attached seamlessly to the neckline of the garment. It displays natural fold patterns, which typically occur due to gathering of fabric, and conforms to the expected appearance of such a design. The gold embroidery is rendered with precision, showing a continuous pattern and coherent lines typical of intricate embroidery work, and lacks broken or jagged edges. This reflects a realistic and meticulous approach consistent with historical garments of this style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hand gripping the sword hilt have exactly five fingers with natural joint bends and skin texture, and is the sword hilt positioned realistically within the grasp without clipping or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the sword hilt is depicted with five fingers, each exhibiting natural joint bends typical of a relaxed yet firm grasp. The texture of the skin appears smooth and realistic, reflecting normal skin characteristics. The sword hilt is positioned naturally within the hand's grip, without any apparent clipping or misalignment, implying that it properly conforms to the hand's shape and position. This accurate representation suggests a careful attention to anatomical and positional detail.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features books and drapery rendered in muted earth tones which complement the subject's attire.
