    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the enchanted vines covering the Eiffel Tower's lattice continuous and aligned with its original structural lines, without jagged edges or inconsistent thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the enchanted vines envelop the Eiffel Tower, tracing its iconic lattice structure. The vines follow the lines and contours with precision, maintaining consistency in thickness and smooth flow along the structure, without jagged edges or disruptions. This reflects an understanding of botanical growth patterns and design alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glowing floral motifs emit light uniformly and cast soft glows that match the ambient lighting from the sunset, without abrupt brightness spikes or disconnected highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays floral motifs that emit light with a gentle and consistent glow, harmonizing with the ambient lighting inspired by sunset hues. The illumination of these motifs is soft, avoiding abrupt changes in brightness or isolated highlights, correlating with principles of ambient light matching and smooth transitions.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ancient stone platform at the base of the tower proportionally scaled to the tower's legs and positioned symmetrically, without visible warping or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stone platform in Image B is proportionally scaled relative to the tower's legs, evident in its symmetrical placement and balanced dimensions. There is no apparent warping or misalignment, suggesting that proportional scaling and geometric placement considerations were made during the design process.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the arcane symbols on the stone platform evenly spaced, properly oriented, and rendered with depth and shadowing that suggest they are carved into the stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features arcane symbols that appear evenly spaced and oriented correctly on the stone platform. They are rendered with depth and shadowing that convincingly indicate the carvings are part of the stone itself, adhering to natural principles of carving and spatial arrangement.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the swirling nebulae in the sky flow smoothly from the towerâ€™s base upward, blending with the orange gradient without sharp edges or disconnected patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The celestial background in Image B flows smoothly from the tower's base upward, blending seamlessly into the orange-hued sky. The transition is fluid, with no sharp edges or disjointed patches, demonstrating a coherent integration with the surrounding ambiance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the crystal pinnacle at the top of the tower have distinct, reflective facets that catch the sunlight and show subtle refractions, without appearing blurry or geometrically distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal pinnacle in Image B is depicted with distinct reflective facets, catching sunlight and displaying subtle refractions. The execution is clear and precise, avoiding blurriness or geometric distortion, embracing principles of light reflection and refraction in crystalline structures.",
