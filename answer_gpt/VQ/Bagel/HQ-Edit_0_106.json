    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the lion’s silhouette maintain correct anatomical proportions and smooth edge definition without visible pixelation or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette represents a lion and should maintain anatomical proportions typical of a lion’s figure. The outline should be smooth, with no visible pixelation or distortion that would suggest a change in shape or proportions that are not characteristic of a lion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the color transitions in the abstract gradient backdrop smooth and free from visible banding or unnatural color boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a gradient backdrop that transitions from dark to light. If these transitions are smooth, there should be no visible lines or steps dividing the colors, suggesting a smooth gradient rather than abrupt changes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the grass textures in the foreground appear naturally lit and spatially coherent with the rest of the scene, without repeating patterns or artificial sharpness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass texture and lighting need to be naturally integrated with the scene's lighting conditions. This means the grass should not show repetitive patterns that suggest artificiality or sharp transitions that disrupt its coherence with the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the angular acacia tree silhouettes structurally plausible and visually balanced within the composition, without broken branches or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouettes of acacia trees in Image B should mirror the known structure of these trees, featuring balanced and plausible branching patterns consistent with typical acacia forms without unnatural breaks or atypical angles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title text positioned above the lion without overlapping its head or body, and does it maintain legible contrast without introducing visual noise or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'KING OF THE WILD' should be positioned to avoid overlapping with the lion's silhouette, ensuring clear legibility and avoiding visual clutter or distortion that would reduce its readability or introduce unwanted noise.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    }
