        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the melted cheese has a smooth, uniform texture that resembles typical melted cheese when hot, with color gradients reflecting the light naturally.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fried onions are placed on top of the melted cheese and sausage, showing a typical arrangement seen in food presentations.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheese appears to melt over the sausage and buns naturally, and the fried onions rest comfortably on the cheese. There is no apparent disruption to the shapes or coherence of the buns, sausages, cheese, and onions. This indicates a seamless integration with the hot dog, reflecting common culinary presentations.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the cheese and fried onions are depicted with sharpness and clear textures. The cheese melts smoothly with defined edges and natural highlights, and the onions maintain their individual shapes and crispy appearance.
