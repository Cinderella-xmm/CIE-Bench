      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the person retain a natural jumping pose that aligns with typical human biomechanics, avoiding any distortion or unnatural posturing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person appears in a dynamic, action-oriented pose indicative of skating or sports activity, which aligns with typical human biomechanics related to jumping. The limbs are positioned naturally to suggest movement and balance, without any apparent distortion or unnatural posture.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bold outlines applied to the person and surrounding elements smooth and continuous, without any jagged edges or breaks that would disrupt the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines surrounding the person and the skateboard feature smooth and continuous lines that help define shapes and contribute to the dynamic, graphic style typical of graffiti artwork. The outlines effectively avoid jagged edges or breaks, maintaining visual flow.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the background blend the graffiti and concrete texture effectively, creating an authentic look without overlapping issues or blending that obscures either element's distinct characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background incorporates both graffiti and a concrete texture in a manner that separates the two. The graffiti artwork is distinct with vibrant colors and bold lettering, while the concrete texture serves as a muted background, allowing both elements to coexist without obscuring individual characteristics.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the individual's face been preserved authentically within the new artistic style, retaining identifiable features like the eyes, nose, and mouth without distortion or excessive simplification?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering Image B, the artistic representation does not preserve the facial features authentically within the graffiti style as the face is obscured rather than retaining clear identifiable features like eyes, nose, and mouth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the details and patterns on the suit, tie, and shirt remain discernible within the hand-drawn style, avoiding any unnatural smudging or loss of defining characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit and tie have been adapted dramatically into the artistic style, primarily focusing on bold colors and shapes that replace typical fabric patterns. This transformation results in a loss of discernible details that would define these clothing items as seen in a realistic version.",
