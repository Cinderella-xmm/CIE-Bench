      "question": "Do the simplified versions of the red motorcycle and blue truck maintain their key features without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red motorcycle and blue truck are rendered in a stylized, cartoonish manner. Despite the simplification, the key features such as the color, basic shape, and identifiable components like wheels and handlebars of the motorcycle, as well as the cab shape and basic features of the truck, are maintained. There are no visible unnatural textures or distortions that detract from their recognizability. This design choice aims to emphasize straightforwardness and attractiveness. Comparing with Image A, the realistic details have been stripped away to focus on form, color, and essential outlines, while ensuring the design remains coherent and recognizable.",

      "question": "Does the rider's black gear retain its essential characteristics without unnatural alterations or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rider's gear is presented in a simplified, cartoon style, preserving essential characteristics like the solid black color and the helmet, which are symbolic of motorcycle riding gear. The stylization does not introduce any unnatural alterations; the gear remains identifiable and representative of motorcycle attire. When compared to Image A, the details are minimized to favor a more playful design without compromising recognizability. The representation remains clear and effective.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the playful touches such as exaggerated proportions or expressive characteristics added without breaking the visual credibility or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features playful elements typical of cartoon designs, such as exaggerated proportions (e.g., larger helmet and simplified bike structure) and expressive characteristics (smiling rider face) that enhance charm without sacrificing overall visual balance. These touches are harmonized within the design, avoiding credibility or artifact issues. Comparison with Image A shows that although realistic proportions have been altered for stylization, visual integrity is preserved through consistent design language and coherent illustration techniques.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the thick white outline applied consistently around the sticker design without interfering with the clarity of the elements within?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thick white outline encircles the sticker design encompassing all elementsâ€”the motorcycle, rider, and the truck. This outline serves to define the boundaries clearly while separating the sticker from the background. It is applied consistently, ensuring it does not obscure or disrupt the internal elements' clarity, allowing each component of the design to remain visible and distinct. Comparison with Image A shows focus on simplified, enhanced clarity through use of bold borders, a common technique in creating sticker designs.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the use of a solid flat color for the circular base, with the motorcycle or truck extending beyond it, achieve a dynamic effect without causing visual inconsistencies or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular base of the sticker serves as a backdrop that anchors the design, while allowing the motorcycle and truck to extend beyond it, contributing to a dynamic, engaging design. This approach visually emphasizes the motion and interaction between objects without causing inconsistencies or loss of critical details. Compared to Image A, the effect is achieved using simple outlines and colors, creating movement and interaction synonymous with cartoon stickers.",
