      "question": "Does the fur of the plush dog appear uniformly soft and textile-like with no visible pixelation or unnatural texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plush dog's fur in Image B appears soft and consistent with a textile-like quality, characteristic of plush toys. The visual cues indicate a uniform, smooth texture without any visible pixelation or unnatural texture artifacts. This analysis is based on common knowledge of how plush toys typically appear and feel, lacking any roughness or pixelation that would suggest lower quality or digital manipulation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the crystal-studded corset properly aligned with the dog's torso and does it display consistent, physically plausible reflections and sparkle without distorted shapes or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal-studded corset in Image B is neatly aligned with the plush dog's torso. The reflections and sparkle appear consistent and realistic, suggesting accurate rendering of light interaction with the crystals. There are no distorted shapes or misplaced elements, which is typical for well-crafted plush toys with attached accessories. This conclusion is drawn from the visual harmony and realism observed in the alignment and sparkle effect.",

      "question": "Are the dog’s paws positioned correctly so that they slightly dangle over the edge of the shelf without intersecting or floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paws of the plush dog are positioned correctly, hanging just over the edge of the shelf, which is typical for an object resting naturally. There is no indication of intersection or floating above the surface, which would be inconsistent with typical physics and gravity effects. This accurate positioning is observed from the image's visual cues and understanding of how objects behave in a real-world setting.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sandy-colored spots on the plush dog’s ears and face maintain their original placement and shape as seen in the original image, without bleeding or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandy-colored spots on the plush dog's ears and face in Image B are observed to maintain their original placement and shape. They do not show any signs of bleeding into the surrounding areas or distortion, which would suggest alterations. This observation is made by noting the consistency in how these spots are presented in relation to the rest of the plush dog, reflecting typical designs seen in plush toys.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features of the plush dog, including the snout, mouth, and nose, proportionally accurate and structurally coherent with the rest of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush dog's facial features, including the snout, mouth, and nose, appear proportionally accurate and structurally coherent with the head. These features are aligned in a manner consistent with manufactured plush toys, showing no disproportion or structural anomalies. The coherence of these features is judged based on their relative positioning and size, which are typical for toys of this kind, ensuring functional and aesthetic integrity.",
