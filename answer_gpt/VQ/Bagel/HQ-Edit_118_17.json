      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the stave church have clear, smooth surfaces with realistic reflections and no visible distortion or warping of the church beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass case has smooth and clear surfaces that encase the model stave church. There are no distortions or warping visible on the church beneath, which is typical of display cases intended to provide unobstructed viewing of the enclosed object. Such cases are designed to showcase the object with minimal interference, suggesting that this case maintains transparency and quality. Therefore, based on the visual cues and common characteristics of high-quality display cases, it is reasonable to conclude it has smooth surfaces without distortion.",

      "question": "Are the layered clouds in the background panel translucent and softly blended, showing depth without blocking or distorting the mountain range behind them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are part of the background panel inside the glass case. They are designed to be solid elements rather than translucent ones, as indicated by their distinct outline and solid color. Hence, they do not show depth or any soft blending, nor do they block or distort any mountains â€“ mainly because Image B does not feature a mountain range but rather a diorama setting inside a glass case. The clouds' placement is independent of any external landscape, confirming their non-translucent and stylized nature.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the small coniferous trees near the base of the church properly scaled, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the larger trees in the surrounding forest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a miniature model inside a glass case, where small coniferous trees are positioned around the stave church. They are properly scaled relative to the overall model, ensuring consistency and proportionality within the context of the diorama. However, the design deviates stylistically from the natural forest composition and size seen in larger scaled environments or real surrounding forests depicted in Image A, as they are artificial features of a diorama rather than consistent with naturally occurring tree formations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the mountains and sky in the background use a consistent muted palette that complements the dark wood tones of the church without creating jarring color transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a diorama with the sky and clouds as part of the background, while realistic mountains are absent. The color palette within the case, such as the light blue background, complements the church's wood tones, but the scheme is stylized rather than naturally muted. It reflects an artistic interpretation appropriate for models, with no abrupt transitions, color clashes, or inconsistency. This differs from Image A, where real mountainous landscapes demonstrate muted transitions, confirming that Image B follows a different palette suited for diorama aesthetics.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the footprints on the snowy path subtle, evenly spaced, and aligned toward the entrance of the church, without appearing artificial or overly pronounced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the footprints leading towards the church are clearly visible and intentionally pronounced, as they are part of the crafted details within the diorama. These footprints are evenly spaced and aligned toward the church's entrance, providing an intentional path in a miniature setting meant to suggest activity or movement. Despite their prominence, in the context of diorama models, such footprints are typically stylized to enhance readability and scale. Therefore, while they may not be subtle in execution, they effectively convey the intended path without excessive artificiality.",
