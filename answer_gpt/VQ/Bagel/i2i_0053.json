    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the bananas retain a natural curvature and texture, avoiding any obvious distortion or unnatural shapes after being redrawn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the bananas with exaggerated smooth surfaces and a simplified shape typical of cartoon styling. The natural curvature is captured without unnatural distortion, focusing on recognizable shapes and maintaining the expected curvature found in real bananas, even when stylized.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the wooden base and metal stand preserve their material properties and structural coherence, without introducing unnatural textures or breaking geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base and stand in Image B are simplified yet maintain their structural integrity. The stand retains its metal-look, presented in a cartoon format, while the base illustrates a wood-like color with simplified design elements, preserving geometric shapes without any unnatural distortions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bold outlines around the bananas and stand clear and consistent, contributing to the chibi-style aesthetic without being overly thick or uneven?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outlines in Image B are consistent and clear, typical of chibi-style drawings, where thicker lines are used for emphasis and aesthetic appeal. They are well applied without excessive thickness or unevenness, enhancing the cartoonish appearance in a balanced manner.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the green hill background integrate seamlessly with the foreground elements, maintaining proportional logic and visual coherence without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green hill background complements the foreground elements, maintaining a cohesive and proportional logic that suits the cartoon environment. The simplified contour and bright color scheme integrate well, creating an overall visually harmonious scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details on the bananas, such as the tips and edges, been preserved in the cartoon redraw, avoiding any loss or distortion that affects the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas are stylized, resulting in a loss of some finer details like precise edges and textural features. The cartoon style inherently simplifies these elements, focusing on the overall recognizable shape rather than intricate detailing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
