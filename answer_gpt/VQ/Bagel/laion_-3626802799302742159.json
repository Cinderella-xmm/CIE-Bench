        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Does the floral pattern on the transformed plate appear continuous, evenly distributed, and consistent with fabric texture, without visible seams or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral pattern on the plate is vivid and evenly distributed, resembling a crafted illustration rather than a fabric texture.

      "question": "Are the added miniature chairs and tea table positioned within the cup and around it in a way that respects physical proportions and does not cause overlapping or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the positioning of the miniature chairs and tea table is logical and respects the physical proportions. The chairs are positioned on the plate around the cup, and the tea table is not inside the cup, which indicates that the design avoids overlapping or floating elements. These objects are strategically placed for adorable scene-setting, maintaining a realistic interaction with the surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the facial expressions on the cookies (grinning, pouting, winking) show clear differentiation in mouth and eye shapes while maintaining symmetry and natural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial expressions on the cookies are distinct and provide varied emotions through different eye and mouth shapes. These features maintain symmetry and natural curvature consistent with cartoon aesthetics, highlighting the playful and expressive nature of each cookie. This differentiation adds character and liveliness to the scene without distorting the overall shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the positions of the cookie characters, chairs, and tea table arranged in a way that suggests stable contact with surfaces and realistic depth, without floating or misplaced objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the cookie characters, chairs, and tea table arranged thoughtfully. The cookies are seen interacting with the cup and seemingly resting on the plate, suggesting stable contact. Similarly, the chairs and tea table are grounded on the plate, reinforcing a sense of depth and stability in the scene setup, ensuring no elements appear floating or misplaced.",
