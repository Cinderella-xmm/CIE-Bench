        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keys feature intricate designs typical of Chinese symbolism, which have been transformed into a 3D cartoon-style chibi rendition. The geometric shapes, like circles around Chinese characters and the complex shapes in key handles, are artistically translated but are recognizably consistent with traditional forms. This demonstrates that the geometric shapes are preserved without notable distortion.",
