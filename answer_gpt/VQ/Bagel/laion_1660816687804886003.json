      "question": "Does the navy blue mesh pattern on the can maintain consistent texture density and alignment without visible warping or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a shoe with a navy blue mesh pattern. The mesh seems to have consistent density and alignment, indicating careful editing. In shoes, mesh patterns are typically uniform and aligned properly to maintain aesthetics and function. Here, there is no visible warping or unnatural stretching observed; the mesh lines are straight and evenly spread across the shoe.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a logo that looks like the letter 'C' mounted on the side of the shoe is visible. It's well-proportioned and clear, with no signs of blurring or deformation, suggesting precision in the editing process to replicate or modify brand logos correctly, akin to actual product marketing.",

      "question": "Are the embossed lace textures evenly spaced and aligned around the can, without jagged edges or inconsistent depth that suggests digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The laces on Image B appear neatly organized, with even spacing and alignment around the shoe, as expected from a well-maintained pair of sneakers. Such precision suggests that there are no digital artifacts observed, as mishandling during editing could lead to jagged or inconsistent lace appearances.",

      "question": "Do the sole stripes wrap seamlessly around the lower half of the can, maintaining their shape and spacing without tearing or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sole stripes appear well-aligned and wrap seamlessly around the lower half of the shoe. They maintain an even spacing and shape, ensuring that they enhance the visual design of the shoe without any tearing or misalignment. Proper design editing keeps these elements uniform.",

      "question": "Is the red \"Kickstart\" text clearly readable, properly centered on the white area, and free from shadowing or blurring that would suggest poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the text on a red label that is still readable, albeit changed in wording. It remains centered on the shoe's tongue area with clear demarcation, which suggests that the editing maintained a high quality of rendering without introducing shadowing or blurring.",
