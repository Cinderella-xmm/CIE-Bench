      "question": "Does the character seamlessly integrate into the tablet screen without any visible gaps or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character Pikachu is depicted without any visible interactions with a tablet screen. The character stands alone against a white background with no indication that it is placed within or on a tablet screen. There are no visible integration details such as reflections, borders, or shadows that suggest seamless integration into a screen. Without these elements, it doesn't appear that Pikachu is integrated into a tablet screen.",

      "question": "Are the character's arms positioned naturally as if reaching out, without any distortion or unusual angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu's arms are raised and bent slightly outward, typical of a joyful or excited pose. The arms are proportionate and follow natural anatomical angles for a cartoon character. There are no visible distortions or unnatural angles in the positioning of the arms, suggesting a deliberate and natural pose.",

      "question": "Do the character's legs extend naturally from the tablet, maintaining proper proportions and avoiding any broken or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu's legs are depicted standing on a flat surface, but there is no implication or visual cue that they are extending from a tablet. The character appears complete with naturally extending legs, which maintain proper proportions without any signs of distortion. The lack of a visible tablet supports the interpretation that the legs are naturally portrayed without any disruption in form.",

    {

      "question": "Has the character's facial expression remained consistent, without any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu's facial expression is cheerful and consistent with traditional depictions of the character, featuring smiling eyes and an open mouth. There are no noticeable differences in texture or detail when compared with typical illustrations of Pikachu. The expression appears consistent, and the clarity and detail of the textures align well with expectations for animated artwork.",

      "question": "Does the tablet fit naturally within the composition of the image, contributing to a coherent and authentic interactive entertainment effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a tablet present around the character. Pikachu is displayed against a plain background without any additional contextual objects like a tablet. Lacking a visual representation of a tablet means that it doesn't contribute to any composition regarding interactive entertainment. Thus, the question of natural fit does not apply here.",
