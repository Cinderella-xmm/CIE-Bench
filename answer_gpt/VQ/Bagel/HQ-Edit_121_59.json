      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the golden wand have smooth, reflective surfaces with consistent lighting and shadows that match the surrounding environment, and is it properly connected to the reel and the fisherman’s hand without gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden wand is observed to be consistently illuminated, reflecting light similar to a shiny metallic object. The wand appears to be firmly gripped by the fisherman with no visible gaps or distortions between the wand and his hand. The lighting and shadows on the wand align with the overall scene, indicating proper integration into the environment. There is no indication of connection to a reel in Image B, it appears as a standalone item being held.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the hat and plaid shirt visibly enhanced but still consistent with real fabric appearance, with no pixelation, stretching, or broken patterns in the weave or seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and plaid shirt are depicted with detailed textures that emulate real fabric. The plaid pattern is consistent and follows a regular grid without any visible stretching or pixelation. The hat appears smooth and natural for the material it is simulating. The pattern and colors also maintain a realistic appearance, with no broken seams or misalignments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the magical ripples originate from the tip of the wand and spread outward in continuous, concentric patterns that interact naturally with the water surface and reflections, without floating or disconnected wave segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the magical ripples are originating from the general area of the wand and seem to spread outward across the water surface. The ripples appear to be continuous and concentric, interacting naturally with the reflection and water surface. There are no floating or disconnected segments visible, indicating a seamless integration of the ripple effect into the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden frame positioned around the image with correct perspective, consistent texture, and shadows that align with the scene’s lighting, and do the embossed pine tree details appear three-dimensional without distortion or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden frame in Image B is positioned surrounding each image with correct perspective, showing consistent wooden texture throughout. The embossed pine tree details are three-dimensional and appear to be well-integrated without clipping or distortion. The shadows from the frame align with the scene’s lighting, enhancing the scene's realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the fisherman’s hands show five fingers each with natural joint positioning and skin texture, and is his facial structure preserved without distortion in both the original and reflected image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fisherman’s hands are depicted with detailed textures that mimic natural skin, showing five fingers on each hand with realistic joint positioning. Although the face is blurred, the general structure of the fisherman’s body, including hands and clothing, is accurately reflected in the water without distortion.",
