      "question": "Are the metallic scales along the transformed body of the saxophone uniformly textured and seamlessly integrated without visible artifacts or breaks in continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the saxophone is transformed into a serpentine form with metallic scales. The scales appear uniformly textured and continuous. There are no visible artifacts or breaks, suggesting the transformation was executed smoothly. The continuity of texture aligns well with real-world expectations of a high-quality CGI or modified image, where seamless integration is crucial.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gemstone replacements for the saxophone keys exhibit natural reflective qualities and geometric precision matching their original positions without deformation or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows gems placed where saxophone keys typically would be. These gemstones possess a reflective quality characteristic of polished gems, and they appear to be geometrically precise without evident deformation or misalignment. Their positioning is consistent with their original positions, accurately retaining the structural positions found in musical instruments.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transformation of the saxophone bell into an open maw with fangs structurally coherent, with no distorted edges or unnatural curvature in the jawline or teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the saxophone bell is transformed into a creature's maw, complete with fangs. The structure appears coherent, with the jawline and teeth depicted clearly and without distortion. The curvature of the jaw is natural, fitting well into the transformed artwork, emphasizing a sound design in the transition from the original saxophone structure to its new form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the coiled body extension of the saxophone follow a logical spiral path with consistent thickness and detailed filigree patterns that appear continuous and non-repetitive?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The coiled extensions resemble a serpent's body, following a logical spiral path with consistent thickness. The detailed patterns on the coil are intricate and do not repeat identically, showcasing a realistic design consideration. Such detailing reflects a high level of uniformity and coherence expected in detailed transformative illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the barbed tongue emerging from the modified reed positioned correctly within the maw and does it have a consistent, realistic texture and shape without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image features a tongue extending from the maw which is modified from the saxophone reed. The tongue appears correctly positioned within the maw, maintaining a consistent texture and realistic shape that matches perceptions of a barbed tongue. It does not seem detached or misaligned, indicating careful consideration in transformation design to preserve natural positioning and alignment.",
