      "question": "Has the removal of the second zebra and grassland resulted in a clean transition without visible artifacts or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual analysis of Image B, the transition where the second zebra and grassland have been removed appears clean. The focus is solely on the remaining zebra with no visible artifacts or unnatural edges where other elements might have been. There are no abrupt or jagged lines that would suggest a poor editing job. Therefore, the removal was executed well.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the green gradient plane replacing the grass blend seamlessly with the zebra and ground, maintaining natural gradients and avoiding sharp contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green background is consistent and smooth, without abrupt contrasts. The shared area between the zebra's feet and the green plane is blended without sharp edges or potentially distracting gradients. This transition suggests a seamless blending, as if the zebra is naturally on the green plane.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the zebra on the left intact and proportionally correct, with no signs of distortion or unnatural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a zebra with well-defined stripes, consistent proportions, and no indication of distortion or texture abnormalities. The zebra maintains its natural proportions with the typical patterns, which provide confidence in its accurate representation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the details of the zebra's stripes and the ground's texture well-preserved, ensuring high-quality representation without loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, close examination shows that the zebra's stripes are sharp and well-preserved, maintaining a high level of detail. The simplicity of the green background aids in highlighting the zebraâ€™s stripes without causing any detriment to the quality of its features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the singular presence of the zebra against a plain green background successfully evokes a serene and solitary environment. There are no extraneous elements or disruptions that could interfere with the minimalistic and focused portrayal of the zebra, allowing for a harmonious composition.",
