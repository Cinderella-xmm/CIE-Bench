      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse robot maintain the same posture and appear structurally consistent with the cow's original position and stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the biomechanical horse robot is positioned on the road, moving in a similar direction as the cow in Image A. The posture of the robot aligns with the general walking posture of the cow, indicating an attempt to maintain structural consistency. The robot mimics the cow's walking gait albeit in a more robotic form, suggesting intentional effort to retain the original stance and position in context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the materials of the biomechanical horse robot, specifically the silver-white metallic shell and exposed joint mechanisms, seamlessly integrated into the rural setting without looking out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the biomechanical horse robot is composed of shiny metallic materials which contrast sharply with the natural greenery and rural setting. The high-tech appearance does not blend seamlessly with the rustic and natural backdrop, which consists of grass, trees, and an outdoor path typical of rural landscapes. Therefore, the robot appears out of place within this context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the textures of the biomechanical horse robot, including the metallic shell and joints, appear natural and detailed without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The biomechanical horse robot in Image B exhibits clear, smooth, and detailed textures on its metallic shell and joints. The robot does not show signs of pixelation or artificial artifacts in its texture, suggesting a well-rendered design. The appearance is polished and natural for a metallic entity, but there is a clear distinction from natural elements surrounding it.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical characteristics of the biomechanical horse robot, like its size relative to the road and grass, realistic and logically consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The biomechanical horse robot in Image B occupies similar spatial proportions on the road as the cow does in Image A, with its size appearing appropriate relative to the road and surrounding grassland. This suggests an intentional design to match the scale, maintaining logical consistency in its positioning and proportions within the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the addition of the biomechanical horse robot preserve the visual plausibility of the scene, meaning does it not disrupt the natural appearance and flow of the road, grass, and trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The introduction of the biomechanical horse robot adds an element that visually contrasts the natural and serene rural scene in Image B. While the robot maintains structural proportion, its futuristic appearance inherently disrupts the integrated natural flow of the landscape. The stark difference in material and styling between the robot and its environment affects the visual plausibility of the setting.",
