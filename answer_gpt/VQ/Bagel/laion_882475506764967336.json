      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the table and chairs composed of uniformly sized brown and amber LEGO bricks with clean, interlocking edges and no visible breaks or misalignments in their surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table and chairs are portrayed as being constructed from LEGO bricks. By examining the visual details, the table and chairs consist of uniformly sized LEGO bricks in shades of brown and amber. The bricks exhibit clean, interlocking edges, which is characteristic of LEGO construction, and there are no visible breaks or misalignments on their surfaces. This assembly style reflects the typical precision of LEGO designs, ensuring that all edges fit together snugly and uniformly without gaps or misalignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the tabletop and chair seats display a consistent LEGO brick texture with repeating stud patterns and no unnatural stretching or distortion of individual bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a table and chairs with a LEGO brick texture. LEGO bricks have a specific stud pattern, which is consistent and evenly spaced across the surface. Upon close inspection of Image B, the tabletop and chair seats maintain a texture consistent with LEGO bricks, featuring repeating stud patterns without exhibiting any unnatural stretching or distortion. These evenly spaced studs are typical of LEGO construction, ensuring that the appearance remains natural and realistic to LEGO designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the central element on the table a LEGO-style plant made of green bricks with recognizable leaf shapes, and is it positioned centrally without overlapping or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central element on the table is portrayed as a structure made from green LEGO bricks, suggestive of a plant. By analyzing the arrangement of bricks, they resemble the recognizable shapes indicative of leaf structures. The central positioning of this LEGO plant does not show any signs of overlapping or floating above the surface, reinforcing the realistic portrayal of the LEGO design where each brick fits neatly onto the studs of the surface below.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the furniture placed on a flat, gray LEGO baseplate that fits snugly beneath the table and chairs, with no overhang beyond the furniture edges and no visible seam between the baseplate and the real ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Referring to Image B, the furniture appears to be set atop a gray LEGO baseplate. Carefully observing the surroundings of the table and chairs, the baseplate aligns closely to the furniture's dimensions without any noticeable overhang beyond the edges. Additionally, the baseplate fits neatly, leaving no visible seam between it and the real concrete ground, which implies a seamless transition between LEGO construction and the actual surface below.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged edges, pixelation, or unnatural lighting shadows around the LEGO furniture that suggest incomplete rendering or poor integration with the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the LEGO furniture within a realistic outdoor setting. A close inspection reveals no apparent artifacts like jagged edges, pixelation, or unnatural lighting shadows around the LEGO furniture. The integration appears smoothly executed, without signs of incomplete rendering or poor cohesion with the background. The shadows and lighting compatibility mirror that of the real environment, suggesting a strong integration effort.",
