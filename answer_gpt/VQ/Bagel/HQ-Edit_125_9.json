      "question": "Does the textured grain overlay appear uniformly distributed across the entire image without causing visible distortion or obscuring fine details such as the soccer ballâ€™s pentagons or facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture does appear uniformly distributed and does not distort the image. The soccer ball's pentagons are visible, indicating that the overlay doesn't obscure critical details. The surface texture adds a vintage magazine look but fine details like the soccer ball's pentagons remain legible and clear.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Are the houses and trees in the background reduced to simplified silhouettes without losing their basic structural form or introducing broken edges or floating shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees and houses are simplified compared to Image A, which gives them a silhouette effect, but they retain their basic structural forms. There is no indication of broken edges or floating shapes, which maintain the integrity of the background.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text \"Footy Legends\" placed across the bottom of the image in a way that does not block essential foreground elements like the soccer ball or the player's foot, and does it blend cohesively with the background without sharp edges or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Footy Legends' is positioned at the bottom, not obstructing the soccer ball or the player's foot. The placement appears cohesive with the background, as the text integrates well visually without sharp, misaligned edges.",
