      "question": "Does the soccer ball retain its natural hexagonal pattern and smooth texture after being transformed into a halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball visibly retains the hexagonal pattern typical of a classic soccer ball, which indicates the patternâ€™s preservation. The texture appears smooth when rendered in the pop-art style due to the continuous contouring of the images, rather than introducing disruptive textural changes. The conclusion is drawn from identifying the distinct pattern, knowledge of soccer ball design, and assessing the transformation into a graphic style without compromising the pattern detail.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glittering effects on the goalpost converted into the halftone pop-art style without creating unnatural textures or losing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the goalpost no longer shows any glittering effects. Instead, it has been rendered in a bold, black outline against a dotted, halftone background, characteristic of pop-art style. Although the style provides a clean line representation, it replaces the glitter with a textured halftone in the outer regions, inherently losing the detailed sparkling texture observable in Image A. This transformation does not capture the original sparkle effects, which points to a forced texture removal rather than an unnatural one.",

      "question": "Do the proportions of the soccer ball and the goalpost remain consistent and physically plausible after applying the halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions between the soccer ball and the goalpost appear consistent and remain so despite being rendered in a pop-art style. The relative sizes are the same in both images, indicating a faithful representation of scale. Knowledge of typical soccer ball and goalpost dimensions assists in determining that these proportions remain unchanged in terms of perceived size and spatial relationship.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the soccer ball and the netting of the goalpost preserved without distortion in the halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hexagonal shapes on the soccer ball are preserved accurately, as are the rectangular patterns of the netting on the goalpost. There are no apparent distortions in these geometric shapes when moving from the real-life texture to the stylized pop-art form, as the essence of these shapes is maintained through precise lines and placements. Hence, it retains the graphical integrity as seen in the original reference.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the soccer ball and goalpost maintain visual credibility without introducing obvious artifacts in the halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the overall composition and layout seen in Image A despite the conversion to a halftone pop-art style. The soccer ball and goalpost placement reflect a natural scene reminiscent of a typical soccer setup. No unintended visual artifacts have been introduced beyond the expected design changes due to stylistic transformation. This preservation reflects knowledge of maintaining artwork composition even when transforming its medium, ensuring both elements are credibly depicted without spatial anomalies.",
