    "Question": "Q1: Do the crystal wands have smooth, continuous surfaces with consistent refraction and no visible digital artifacts or irregularities in shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal wands appear visually smooth and uniform in their surfaces. The refraction through the wands is consistent with what is typically seen in crystal objects, which usually have predictable light interactions without distortions. Looking at the overall presentation, there are no obvious digital artifacts or abnormalities in the shape of the wands, indicating a high-quality rendering or genuine image capture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the etched floral patterns on the crystal vase evenly distributed, continuous, and visually integrated into the surface without breaking lines or inconsistent shading?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing the etched floral patterns on Image B, they appear evenly distributed around the vase, maintaining a seamless continuity. There are no visible breaks in the lines or shading that would imply a mismatch or editing error. The patterns are well integrated, enhancing the overall aesthetic of the vase.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the carved crystal ribbon fully formed with intact floral motifs and no visible breaks, overlaps, or flattened areas that suggest a 2D-to-3D conversion error?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the carved crystal ribbon shows intact floral motifs, indicating quality craftsmanship or high-quality image capture. There are no noticeable breaks, overlaps, or flattened areas. This suggests a consistent and accurate depiction without errors typically associated with digital conversion from 2D to 3D.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the reflection on the mirrored surface show a clear, undistorted image of the crystal vase and its contents, with proper symmetry and matching lighting?",
    "explanation": "The reflection in Image B is subjected to visual analysis, showing symmetry and lighting consistency. There appears to be no distortion in the reflection, which accurately represents the shape and contents of the vase. These reflections are consistent with expectations of mirrored surfaces showing clarity and proper light distribution.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the pearls uniformly sized, evenly spaced, and free from warping or blurring that suggests compression or incorrect rendering due to the crystal vase?",
    "explanation": "Image B is assessed for the presence of pearls. However, the image primarily features crystal items, not pearls. As there are no pearls visible within or around the vase, this question is based on incorrect assumptions related to the contents of the image. The pearls are not present in this image.",
    "answer": "No"
