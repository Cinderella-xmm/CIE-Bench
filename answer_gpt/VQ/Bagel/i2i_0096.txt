    "Question": "Q1: Does the sofa maintain its structural integrity and proportions from both the front and side views, avoiding any unusual geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa, when viewed from the front, appears accurately proportioned with no significant distortions in its shape or geometry. The armrests, backrest, and overall form of the sofa correspond to the expected appearance of a standard cushioned sofa. They maintain symmetry and balance, typical of furniture design. There are no visible signs of stretching, skewing, or distortion that would indicate a lack of structural integrity. Additionally, the back and arm sections align properly with each other, retaining the sofa's characteristic shape when seen from this angle.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the fabric textures and details of the sofa consistent and clear in both the front and side views, without any visible loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "The fabric texture, as depicted in Image B, exhibits a consistent appearance with visible details across the cushion surfaces. The texture is uniform and does not show signs of blurring or pixelation that would suggest editing artifacts or loss of detail. This clarity is important for maintaining the overall realism of the material, which in this case, looks like a standard choice for upholstery that combines both practicality and aesthetics. The visible stitching and fabric grain are appropriate for the material and indicate a consistent and clear presentation of the sofa's texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the cushions and legs of the sofa align naturally between the front and side views, maintaining visual plausibility and coherence?",
    "explanation": "The arrangement of the cushions in Image B appear to be symmetrical and evenly distributed across the sofa. The cushions maintain their plausible alignment, characteristic of a well-organized seating area. The legs of the sofa are also positioned in a manner consistent with supporting the structure evenly, following logical placement based on the sofa’s design. The alignment between these elements—cushions and legs—demonstrates coherence and adherence to expected sofa proportions, thereby achieving visual harmony.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the light and shadow effects on the sofa and surrounding area remain consistent and natural when transitioning from the front to the side view?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the light source is depicted as natural sunlight coming from the left, casting consistent and plausible shadows while illuminating the sofa. The shadow cast by the sofa is sharp yet appropriately softened, suggesting a nearby light source like a window. The way these shadows fall, along with the sofa's highlights, suggests no abrupt or unnatural changes, which convey coherence in lighting conditions across perspectives. This realistic portrayal of lighting ensures the scene remains visually believable.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the artwork on the wall and the wall itself retain their natural appearance and realism when viewed from both the front and side perspectives?",
    "explanation": "The artwork in Image B is displayed clearly, showing consistent color gradients and retaining its central circular motif without any visible distortion or color shifts. Similarly, the wall provides a seamless background with uniform color and no patchiness. The resolution and texture of the wall are consistent, adding to the realism of the flat surface without signs of any alteration. The overall balance of the artwork within its frame and its placement on the wall appear natural, suggesting an undisturbed and coherent scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
