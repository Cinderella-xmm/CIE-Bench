      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the chibi version of the woman have a proportionally enlarged head relative to the body, with limbs and torso scaled down appropriately without deformed joints or elongated limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi version of the woman features a notably larger head compared to the body, which is a common trait in chibi-style character designs. The limbs and torso are appropriately scaled down, maintaining a coherent proportion without any indications of deformed joints or elongated limbs, which are typical of the desired aesthetic in chibi models.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the oversized frills on the gown rendered with curved, layered shapes that suggest fabric volume, and do they avoid flat, rigid edges or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gown in Image B includes oversized frills that are depicted with curved and layered shapes. These shapes effectively suggest the volume typical of fabric, avoiding flat, rigid edges or unnatural stretching which would detract from the gown's realistic portrayal in this stylized chibi format.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the jewelry show consistent metallic highlights and soft shadows that align with the lighting direction in the scene, without harsh glints or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold accents in the jewelry of Image B reflect consistent metallic highlights and soft shadows, harmonizing with the lighting direction in the scene. They lack harsh glints or texture artifacts, which ensures a smooth and realistic depiction of the metallic surface.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the modified chair still identifiable as a chair with four legs and backrest, scaled down proportionally and colored vividly without broken geometry or missing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the modified chair is not present, as the chibi character is designed more as a standalone figure. This leads to the omission of furniture or additional objects that might have been included in the original context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the pearl border surround the image edge evenly, with uniformly sized spheres and consistent spacing, without overlapping the subject or showing jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a pearl border that evenly surrounds the edge. The spheres appear uniformly sized with consistent spacing, maintaining an aesthetically pleasing and consistent outline without overlapping the subject or exhibiting jagged edges, which would disrupt the design.",
