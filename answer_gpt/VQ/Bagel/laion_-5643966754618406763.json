    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the tread patterns on the tire surfaces preserved and reinterpreted as armored segments with no visible texture repetition or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tread patterns from Image A have been transformed into a mechanical, armored texture on the body of what appears to be a mechanized armadillo-like creature. This transformation maintains the original pattern's intricate detail without visible repetition or texture loss. The segments are distinctly detailed and positioned to mimic an armadillo's armor plating effectively, demonstrating a reinterpretation that maintains high detail fidelity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic joints within the wheel openings align properly with the original rim shape and appear physically connected without gaps or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rim-like features have been incorporated into the creature's legs, representing joints and other mechanical segments. These parts are well-integrated into the design, aligning appropriately without visible gaps or deformation, suggesting a cohesive, mechanical design completion that matches the rim's original shape and function.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glowing mechanical eyes centered within the hub openings, emitting light consistently without haloing, pixelation, or unnatural brightness spillage onto adjacent surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical eyes depicted in Image B are designed as glowing elements embedded within the face of the creature. They emit a consistent blue light that is crisp and well-centered, showing no signs of haloing, pixelation, or overly harsh lighting that affects nearby areas. This suggests deliberate control over the lighting effects to maintain visual quality and realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the antennae attached to the upper portion of the tire stack with continuous, smooth geometry and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The antennae in Image B are designed to extend smoothly from the creature's head, demonstrating integrated geometry with no apparent floating or disconnection issues. They maintain a continuous, curved structure which seamlessly emerges from the body's top, indicating precise attachment and design continuity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire structure composed of the tires forming a unified, balanced creature shape with no missing, duplicated, or incorrectly scaled parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a fully realized mechanized creature, adapted from the tire stack of Image A. The transformation is done with apparent precision, resulting in a cohesive and balanced design that does not exhibit missing, duplicated, or improperly scaled parts. This adherence to structural balance and unity supports the creature's mechanically plausible and aesthetically consistent appearance.",
