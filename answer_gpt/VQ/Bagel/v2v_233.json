      "question": "Does the leaf inside the snow globe maintain its natural shape and texture without any visible distortions or unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf inside the snow globe appears to maintain its natural shape and texture. The vein patterns and edges are clear and consistent with a realistic depiction of a leaf. Without visible distortions or artifacts, the leaf looks authentic and maintains its integrity within the snow globe environment.",

      "question": "Are the snowflakes around the leaf inside the snow globe visually plausible and do they enhance the scene without introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowflakes encircling the leaf in Image B appear as small, delicate patterns typical of snowflakes, which are consistent with a natural depiction. They provide additional visual interest and context to the winter-themed snow globe without introducing any unusual or distracting textures, hence they enhance the visual appeal of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the gentle ripples in the water around the leaf inside the snow globe look natural and do they maintain the structural integrity of the leaf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible water ripples around the leaf as it is placed inside a snow globe. The absence of water and ripples in this context means that the concern for ripples and their effect on the leaf's integrity is not applicable. Instead, the leaf remains visually intact and undisturbed within the snow globe.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the snow globe rest naturally on the tabletop with realistic reflections and refractions, contributing to the overall visual credibility of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B is positioned on a tabletop with realistic lighting and shadow play, which contribute to its natural appearance. The overall reflections and refractions look plausible, considering the lighting source and angles. These elements collectively enhance the believability of the snow globe's presence in the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the softly blurred background with warm tones free of any unnatural artifacts and does it harmoniously blend with the snow globe scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is deliberately blurred with warm tones, providing a soft, inviting atmosphere that complements the snow globe setting. The absence of any jarring or unnatural artifacts ensures that the background harmoniously integrates with the snow globe's theme, enhancing the overall aesthetic.",
