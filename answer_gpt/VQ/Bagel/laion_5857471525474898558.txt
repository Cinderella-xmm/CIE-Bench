    "Question": "Q1: Are the LEGO-style bricks on the building facade uniformly sized, aligned in rows, and free from visible texture repetition or blurring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the building has been transformed into a structure that mimics LEGO bricks. Each brick appears to be uniformly sized, perfectly aligned in rows, and maintains a consistent brick pattern without any visible texture repetition or blurring. This reflects a consistent application of the LEGO aesthetic, with each brick maintaining its defined edges and uniformity in size.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the window frames appear as solid, blocky LEGO elements with consistent thickness and alignment, matching the original window positions and sizes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the window frames are transformed into blocky LEGO elements. They maintain a consistent thickness and alignment that matches the original window positions and sizes observed in Image A. The transformation keeps the proportions and maintains the same structural layout, honoring the original architectural design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Do the green LEGO vines grow along the same vertical paths as the original plants, maintaining segmented, blocky forms without stretching or breaking continuity?",
    "explanation": "The green LEGO vines in Image B follow the same vertical paths as the original plants seen in Image A. They maintain a segmented, blocky form that resembles LEGO pieces, without any noticeable stretching or breaking in continuity. This transformation effectively captures the original plant structure using LEGO-like aesthetics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Are the gray LEGO railings on each balcony evenly spaced, horizontally aligned, and securely connected to the balcony base without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gray LEGO railings are present on each balcony. They appear evenly spaced and horizontally aligned, maintaining a secure connection to the balcony base, without visible floating or incorrect overlapping. This suggests a thoughtful adaptation of balcony elements into LEGO-style design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a flat, level platform extending beneath the entire building base, positioned consistently with the sidewalk and not overlapping with parked vehicles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the view shows the base of the building where it meets the sidewalk. There is no distinct flat, level platform resembling LEGO pieces beneath the building base. The parked vehicles appear appropriately positioned without overlap, suggesting that the base coordination with the sidewalk remains unchanged from the original.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do all architectural elements—including windows, doors, balconies, and rooflines—remain in their original positions and maintain proper alignment and spacing relative to one another?",
    "explanation": "Image B retains all architectural elements such as windows, doors, balconies, and rooflines in their original positions, maintaining proper alignment and spacing as seen in Image A. The LEGO transformation respects the original layout and distribution, ensuring structural coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there any visible seams, color bleeding, or sharp edges at the borders between the LEGO building and the sky, trees, or parked cars?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation into a LEGO structure is clean and well integrated, with no visible seams, color bleeding, or sharp edges at the borders with the sky, trees, or parked cars. The transition between the LEGO elements and the surroundings is smooth, indicating a high-quality edit.",
    "answer": "No"
