        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi zebra character features clear and consistent zebra stripes typical of a zebra's black and white pattern.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi zebra is shown with a miniature striped cake that mirrors the real zebra's interaction with the cake in Image A.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design elements including 'ZebraLover' username and social media icons are integrated into the frame in Image B. They are positioned logically and align with common modern social media layouts, maintaining the coherence of the frame's appearance and not overpowering the focal elementsâ€”the chibi zebra and the cake.",

      "question": "Are the materials used for the chibi zebra and the cake natural in appearance, without any obvious unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi zebra and its accompanying cake in Image B have a stylized appearance typical of chibi art. The textures are smooth and crafted to mimic the cute, non-detailed look often associated with stylized models like toys or illustrations. While not fully mimicking reality, there are no unnatural textures that stand out as erroneous given the art style.",
