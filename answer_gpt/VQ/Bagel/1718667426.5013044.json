      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre is designed as a chibi or cartoon-style character, which traditionally has simplified yet balanced proportions to create an exaggerated cute effect.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of both the ogre's body and clothing, including its cape and belt, appears matte, matching a typical cartoonish representation.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the club held by the ogre has soft, rounded edges, consistent with cartoon design aesthetics for safety and simplicity, enhancing the perception of a foam-like material.
