      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the gown worn by the central figure have natural fabric folds and realistic embroidery patterns that follow the contours of her body without visible distortion or floating textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gown of the central figure in Image B is detailed with embroidery, but upon close inspection, the embroidery patterns and fabric folds do not visually adhere to the natural contours of the body as one would expect. The patterns appear somewhat flat and unnaturally textured, suggesting a lack of realistic fabric flow, which results in visible distortion in the presentation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hair of the central figure styled in a manner consistent with Renaissance fashion, with smooth transitions, no unnatural clumping, and realistic flow under gravity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hair of the central figure seems to mimic the intricate Renaissance style with curls and ornaments typical of that era. However, upon examination, the transitions between strands appear unnatural, and there is clumping that doesn't flow realistically under gravity as one would expect with natural hair. These issues suggest a lack of consistency in styling and realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the figures in the background dressed in Elizabethan-style garments with correctly proportioned sleeves, collars, and body shapes, and do they maintain anatomical alignment without limbs appearing distorted or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in the background wear garments that resemble Elizabethan style with elaborate collars and sleeves. However, there are noticeable issues with the proportion and alignment of these elements, including sleeves and collars that do not align correctly with the proportions of the figures' bodies. Additionally, some limbs appear distorted, suggesting a misalignment of anatomy.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background feature a cobblestone ground with consistent stone size and spacing, and does it include architectural elements like arches or columns that align properly with perspective and scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cobblestone ground in Image B is depicted with stones of varying sizes and inconsistent spacing, which detracts from the authenticity and uniformity expected from such a surface. Additionally, the architectural elements like arches and columns, if present, do not follow a cohesive alignment with the scene's perspective and scale, leading to a disjoined representation.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the oil paint texture applied consistently across all surfaces, preserving fine details such as fabric weave, facial features, and architectural lines without visible smudging or over-smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the overall texture in Image B attempts to replicate an oil painting style, there are evident inconsistencies. Some areas such as fabric and architectural details lack the necessary fine detail, and the texture in certain places appears smudged or overly smoothened, losing the distinctiveness of lines and features. These inconsistencies compromise the maintenance of intricate details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the hands of the central figure show five fingers per hand with natural knuckle definition, skin texture, and positioning consistent with human anatomy, without extra digits or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central figure's hands are positioned prominently, showing five fingers on each. However, upon analysis, there is a lack of natural knuckle definition and skin texture that one would expect to see. The fingers also seem incorrectly positioned or unnaturally bent, which suggests anatomical inconsistencies.",
