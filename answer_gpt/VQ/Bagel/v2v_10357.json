      "question": "Are the shapes of the teddy bear and motorcycle still recognizable after being converted to a low-poly 3-D render style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The low-poly 3-D style simplifies shapes into geometric forms, but the overall contours and key structural elements of both the teddy bear and motorcycle are preserved. The bear retains its seated posture and identifiable features such as a helmet and cape, while the motorcycle maintains its distinguishable form with visible parts like the handlebars, wheel, and general body structure. Given this analysis, both the teddy bear and motorcycle remain recognizable in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the teddy bear and motorcycle retain their texture details without appearing overly simplified or losing important features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the low-poly 3-D render style, textures are typically simplified to emphasize geometric shapes rather than intricate surface details. The teddy bear's fuzzy texture and the motorcycle's metallic sheen are not detailed in Image B, instead replaced by solid colors and smooth surfaces, which are characteristic of this style. Therefore, the texture details are indeed simplified compared to the original image.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the teddy bear and motorcycle consistent with their real-world counterparts, avoiding any distortion or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions in Image B appear consistent with real-world counterparts. The teddy bear's size relative to the motorcycle is coherent, maintaining plausible dimensions and scaling. This preserves the sense of realism in proportion and size, avoiding overt distortions or unrealistic scaling.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the teddy bear appear naturally seated on the motorcycle, maintaining a believable posture and interaction with the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite being in a low-poly 3-D style, the teddy bear's posture matches that of a seated position on a motorcycle. The bear has its arms positioned towards the handlebars and legs in placement consistent with sitting, maintaining a believable interaction with the vehicle. The pose contributes to the natural look of the seating despite the stylistic changes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the scenic background seamlessly integrated with the low-poly 3-D rendered teddy bear and motorcycle, without any visible artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the scenic background with a depiction of the landscape that complements the low-poly style. The integration looks natural without noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies. The simplicity of the background meshes well with the low-poly foreground elements, achieving a seamless integration of environment and subject.",
