      "question": "Does the area around the apples show any unnatural textures or artifacts after adding the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the addition of the text 'Fresh' at the bottom left and 'Sweet' at the top right does not introduce any visible artifacts or unusual textures around the apples. The background and surface upon which the apples sit look smooth and consistent, without any pixelation or disruption that would suggest editing artifacts. This indicates that the image's texture has been preserved accurately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the fonts for \"Fresh\" and \"Sweet\" appear visually consistent with the background image, avoiding any visual disruption or inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' in Image B is presented in a clear, bold font against a plain background. The use of black color for the text contrasts well with the background, ensuring that the text is readable. However, there is no additional stylistic integration with the overall image, such as color matching with the apples or shadow effects that would blend the text more seamlessly. Despite this, the text works well with the overall composition without causing visual disruption.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the shapes of the apples preserved without distortion after incorporating the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apples are intact and maintain their original, natural shapes after the addition of the text. Their rounded form and proportions are consistent with real apples, and the text does not interfere with their appearance. The placement of the text is sufficiently distant from the apples, preventing any overlap or distortion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the alignment of the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right properly aligned so that it doesn't alter the apples' structure or visual balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Fresh' is positioned at the bottom left while the text 'Sweet' is at the top right. The alignment of 'Fresh' is adequate, and the text does not encroach upon the apples, preserving the visual balance of the image. The text 'Sweet' is absent in this image therefore cannot affect any visual balance.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the apples, including their speckles and light reflections, remained clear and undamaged after adding the text “Fresh” and “Sweet”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speckles, light reflections, and other fine details of the apples remain sharp and undistorted, demonstrating a clear representation of the apples. None of the added text impacts these areas, allowing the fruit to preserve its original detailed appearance. The natural texture and coloration of the apples remain intact.",
