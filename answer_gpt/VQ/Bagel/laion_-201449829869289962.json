      "question": "Does the dome glass case show smooth transparency with realistic light interaction and no visible stitching or warping around the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dome glass case visually appears to have a smooth and clear surface. The lighting is consistent with real glass as it gently reflects light, suggesting realistic light interaction. There are no visual artifacts such as stitching or warping found along its edges, indicating that the case is designed with proficient detail. World knowledge of glass properties such as transparency and light refraction helps confirm its realism.",

      "question": "Are the dimensions of the church tower, roof, and adjacent buildings proportionally consistent with one another as if reduced uniformly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church tower and the adjacent buildings are proportionally coherent within the diorama setting. Their sizes relative to one another are uniform, suggesting a consistent reduction in scale from real-world proportions. This observation is supported by common architectural design principles where proportionality is maintained to ensure balance in smaller-scale models.",

      "question": "Are the newly added small houses aligned with the original architectural style and do they have correctly shaped roofs, windows, and textures without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small houses added to the landscape are consistent with the architectural style visible in the church and surrounding buildings. They feature correctly shaped roofs and windows that match the regional design seen in the original structures. The textures appear smooth and appropriately detailed for a miniaturized diorama without signs of deformation. The consistency in architecture and texture suggests a logical construction within the model.",

      "question": "Does the copper roof on the church tower display realistic texture variations, oxidation effects, and lighting response consistent with real copper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The copper roof in Image B presents a smooth color gradient and light reflection typical of a copper surface. While detailed texture variations and oxidation effects are not overtly discernible, the lighting response, including subtle highlights and shading, aligns with the expected appearance of copper. Real-world knowledge suggests copper surfaces have distinct aging and light-reflective qualities, which are mirrored in this model.",

      "question": "Is the mist along the distant mountains smoothly diffused with gradual opacity changes and no abrupt edges or blocky patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B demonstrates a smoothly diffused mist across the mountain range. The transition of opacity is gradual, allowing for a natural progression from the foreground to the misty background without any sudden or blocky interruptions. This mirrors realistic atmospheric conditions, where mist usually forms with subtle gradient changes.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the gold pedestal positioned directly under the base of the diorama and does it have a solid, grounded appearance with no floating or misaligned parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold pedestal is positioned as the foundation under the diorama. It appears solid and grounded, supporting the diorama with no evidence of floating or misalignment. The placement is consistent with typical diorama stands designed to uphold the model securely, using general knowledge of bases and stands for miniature displays.",

      "question": "Do the terraced vineyards show consistent spacing and natural curvature without visible grid lines or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The terraced vineyards in Image B exhibit even spacing and a flowing natural curvature, which is a characteristic feature of real vineyard setups in mountainous terrains. There is no indication of grid lines or pixelation, suggesting smooth transitions and precise modeling in the diorama. Observing real-world vineyard designs helps understand the spatial arrangements and aesthetic flow.",
