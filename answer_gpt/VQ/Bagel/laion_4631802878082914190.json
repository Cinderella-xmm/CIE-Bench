      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the animal characters positioned directly over the original locations of the process boxes without shifting or overlapping neighboring elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal characters are placed in different parts of the image, each correlating to a segment in the original diagram in Image A that had process boxes. The characters do not seem to precisely overlay the positions of the original boxes in Image A, suggesting some level of repositioning or creative liberty. For instance, the fox with a clipboard collectively replaces the business and data understanding areas. The owl and raccoon appear connected to the 'Data Preparation' and 'Modeling' regions. The placements are approximate, not exact overlays, hence overlapping with or shifting from where the precise locations would be.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the playful paths between characters form a continuous, unbroken winding route that follows the circular structure of the original diagram without abrupt turns or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Assessing Image B, the paths seem to mimic a playful interpretation of pathways but do not strictly adhere to the continuous unbroken path in Image A. The route around Image B does possess playful dots and dashed routes between animals, yet these do not form a single coherent path as the original circular process diagram meant to. The dotted trails symbolize movement or actions but not a continuous route.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the central cluster of glowing data crystals positioned at the center of the diagram and scaled appropriately so it does not dominate or shrink the surrounding characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing data crystals are placed towards the center of the pathway intersection; however, they are not exactly central considering the path layout. They are scaled to appear significant but not overwhelmingly large compared to the animal characters. There is balance regarding scale, as characters have enough space around them, and the crystals do not shrink the view on them.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the speech bubbles placed near each character without overlapping them or other elements, and do they contain legible text that is consistent in font and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubbles in Image B are close to each character they represent. Each bubble is distinct, with no overlapping on other elements or characters, ensuring clarity. The text within the bubbles is clear and maintains a relatively uniform font size and style, contributing to consistent readability throughout the illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the animal characters display realistic limb positions and interactions with props (e.g., magnifying glass, laptop, clipboard) that conform to known anatomy and ergonomics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the animal characters with anthropomorphic features, holding and interacting with objects like a magnifying glass, clipboard, and laptop in a manner typical of human gestures. The anatomy follows a cartoon style, where the props are held convincingly based on known ergonomic placements for these kinds of illustrations, therefore consistent within the fantasy setting's pretend anatomy rules.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all elements (characters, paths, background, text) rendered with consistent line art, shading, and color saturation, avoiding mismatched textures or sudden changes in style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is consistent in its art style, using uniform line art, shading, and a harmonious color palette throughout. Characters, pathways, background, and text exhibit a coherent artistic style typical of a cartoon nature illustration, without sudden textual changes or textural discrepancies.",

      "question": "Is the title banner located at the top edge of the image, fully visible, and not overlapping any part of the diagram or characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title banner in Image B is located at the top of the image. It is distinctly positioned, fully visible and does not obstruct any part of the diagram or character. The placement adheres to a topmost, standalone spot, serving as an introductory element to the scene beneath.",
