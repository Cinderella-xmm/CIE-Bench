      "question": "Does the addition of the \"Clean First\" slogan in the top left corner maintain the natural appearance and does not introduce any obvious artifacts like blurry edges or inconsistent lighting?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Clean First' slogan appears in the top left corner. Analyzing this area, it appears that the added text blends relatively well with the tiled background. The lighting on the text appears consistent with the image's overall lighting, and no obvious artifacts such as blurry edges or lighting inconsistencies are present in this region.",

      "question": "Is the \"Comfort Always\" slogan added in the bottom right corner visually credible, maintaining structural consistency and not causing any distortion or degradation of the surrounding tiles' texture and details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'Comfort Always' slogan in Image B is placed on the bottom right corner. By analyzing this region, the added text seems to integrate with the tile background without overly distorting or degrading the tile texture. The tiles' lines around the text appear intact and do not show significant signs of disruption or lack of alignment.",

      "question": "Do the fonts and styles of both slogans blend naturally with the background, avoiding any unnatural textures or interruptions in the tile patterns behind them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both slogans 'Clean First' and 'Comfort Always' have been added. The fonts used are bold and black, ensuring they are distinguishable against the tiled wall background. However, there might be some contrast between the modern bold font style and the neutral, textured bathroom tiles, which could make the text stand out slightly, but no obvious unnatural textures or interruptions in the tile patterns are noted around the text.",

      "question": "Do the sizes and placements of the \"Clean First\" and \"Comfort Always\" slogans create a balanced composition that complements the image without overwhelming the toilet and its setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Clean First' and 'Comfort Always' are positioned at the top left and bottom right corners respectively. Their placements ensure that they do not overshadow or overwhelm the central object, the toilet. The size of the text is large enough to be readable yet does not detract from the main focus, maintaining compositional balance. The layout contributes to a balanced visual flow surrounding the central toilet image.",

      "question": "Are the slogans aligned in a way that respects the geometric shapes of the tiled walls and floor, ensuring the structural and visual coherence of the entire image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The placement of the 'Clean First' and 'Comfort Always' slogans in Image B respects the geometric shapes of the tiled background. Each text block is placed in a straightforward manner, likely aligned to the natural grid created by the tiled walls, maintaining the structural coherence without awkward positioning or angles.",
