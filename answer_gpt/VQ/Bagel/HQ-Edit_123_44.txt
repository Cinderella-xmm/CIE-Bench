    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass display case surrounding the aircraft have smooth, clear surfaces without visible distortion, scratches, or unnatural reflections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass case surrounding the aircraft appears to be clear and smooth. There are no visible distortions, scratches, or reflections that mar the surface of the glass. The clarity allows for the contents inside, including the model aircraft and clouds, to be seen distinctly, which indicates that both lighting and material rendering have been managed well to avoid any visual imperfections.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the leather accents and brass corners attached to the display case with accurate material textures, proper lighting response, and no visible seams or floating effects?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a display case with leather accents and brass corners. The textures of the leather appear realistic, showcasing a slightly pebbled texture typical of such material. The brass corners reflect light accurately, consistent with metallic surfaces. Upon observation, there are no visible seams or floating effects that would suggest improper attachment or rendering. The elements appear firmly positioned and integrated into the design of the case.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the engraved emblem on the front of the display case clearly defined with appropriate depth and shadowing, and does it blend naturally into the glass surface?",
    "explanation": "The engraved emblem on the display case in Image B appears clearly defined with visible depth. The emblem has shadows that provide a sense of dimensionality. However, it should be noted that the emblem is not blended into the glass surface but rather attached to the leather aspect of the case, which aligns with correct material attachment rather than blending into glass.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the miniature clouds positioned inside the glass case, visually separated from the aircraft, and rendered with soft, volumetric textures without clipping or unnatural transparency?",
    "explanation": "Inside the glass display case of Image B, the miniature clouds are distinct from the aircraft, with separation providing a clear view of each element. They are rendered with soft, volumetric textures that successfully simulate clouds, without any clipping issues or unnatural transparency. This suggests attentive modeling and rendering to achieve a realistic miniature scene inside the case.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the propellers depicted with rotational motion blur and properly aligned with the engine nacelles, without deformation or clipping against the display case?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the propellers on the aircraft model are not depicted with rotational motion blur, as they appear static without signs of dynamic motion. The alignment appears correct relative to the engine nacelles, with no deformation or clipping against the display case. Hence, the static representation respects spatial requirements while the lack of motion blur contrasts the expectation of depicting motion.",
    "answer": "No"
