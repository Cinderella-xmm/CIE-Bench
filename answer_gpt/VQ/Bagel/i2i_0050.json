      "question": "If motion trajectory lines were added around the horse, would they appear naturally integrated with the environment without disrupting the image's authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see motion trajectory lines added to a silhouetted figure in three phases of motion. These lines emphasize the dynamic motion of the figure and do not clash with the minimalist, stylistic design. However, in the context of Image A, where a real-life horse is set against a realistic beach and ocean background, adding motion trajectory lines could appear unnatural and disrupt the authenticity of the scene. Horses in reality don't naturally come with visual motion lines; therefore, any additional graphic element like motion lines might compromise the natural appearance of Image A.",

      "question": "If a skater was added near the house in the background, would the scale and perspective match the existing scene correctly, maintaining structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is presented in silhouette style, without detailing or perspective. If this stylized skater were inserted into the realistic background of Image A, matching the scale and perspective would be challenging due to the significant stylistic differences. In Image A, objects have depth and scale consistent with real-world measurements. A stylized figure might look out of scale or mismatched in perspective when added to a realistic scene, because the silhouette style lacks three-dimensional cues.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "If the skater's three motion phases were imposed over the sea and land, would the transitions between these phases look smooth without introducing artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts clean, crisp silhouettes outlining a series of motion phases, ensuring a smooth, uninterrupted depiction of movement. However, placing these within the realistic textures of sea and land in Image A could present challenges. Sea and land have varied textures and complexities, and introducing stark silhouettes could disrupt these natural patterns and textures, possibly introducing visual artifacts that seem unnatural in a realistic setting.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Would the details of the horse's fur texture and the surrounding grass remain visually coherent and undistorted after adding the skater's motion trajectory?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows strong, clear silhouetted forms that don't depict fine textures like fur or grass. Adding motion trajectory lines in Image A, which has detailed textures of the horse's fur and surrounding grass, could introduce visual noise, compromising the coherence and clarity of these intricate textures. The addition of graphic elements typical in stylized images could clash with these realistic details and distort the natural appearance of the scene.",

      "question": "If the skater's starting motion frames were placed in this scenic setting, would the composition maintain balance and coherence without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B's stylized silhouettes to Image A’s realistic setting highlights a potential mismatch in stylistic coherence. Image B is entirely stylized, emphasizing motion without environmental context, whereas Image A is naturalistic. Superimposing stylized motion frames onto Image A’s detailed setting could disturb the composition’s balance and cause the skater to seem mismatched and out of place amidst the natural environment, due to differences in artistic style and realism.",
