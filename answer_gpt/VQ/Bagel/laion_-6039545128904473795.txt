    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features on the central body aligned with the original angular design and free from visible texture artifacts or shape distortions?",
    "explanation": "The central body in Image B has facial features with pronounced angular lines that reflect a robotic design, aligning with a stylized look. There are no visible texture artifacts or shape distortions on the face, maintaining the integrity of the design. Angular designs typically exhibit sharp, clean geometry, and this balance is maintained in the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the arms formed from rotor blades have consistent proportions and smooth joints that suggest functional rotation without visible warping or breakage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arms extending from the body mimic rotor blades that are intended to rotate. They maintain consistent proportions in relation to the body and appear constructed with smooth joints. This design suggests functionality, and there is no noticeable warping or breakage that would hinder rotational movement. This is consistent with the expectation for operational mechanical limbs.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the spider-like legs connected at the original landing gear locations and do they display coherent joint structures without gaps or floating segments?",
    "explanation": "The spider-like legs in Image B emerge from where landing gear would typically be on a drone. They display coherent joint structures, which implies a logical attachment point, mimicking biological form. These joints appear continuous, and there are no visible gaps or floating segments that would disrupt the structural continuity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the lighting on the drone consistent with the futuristic cityscape background, showing appropriate metallic reflections and no harsh transitions between the drone and environment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the drone is consistent with the ambient lighting of the futuristic cityscape. The drone exhibits metallic reflections that match the light source and intensity observed in the environment. There are no harsh transitions; the integration between the drone and the background is seamless, reflecting a coherent scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the speech bubble positioned near the robotic face with clear, legible text and no overlap with drone components or background elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubble is strategically placed near the robotic face, ensuring the viewer easily associates it with the robot. The text inside is clear and legible, providing an immediate reading without confusion. There is no interference from the drone components or background elements, maintaining text clarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
