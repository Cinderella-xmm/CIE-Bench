        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the guitar with consistent proportions and structure. The guitar neck and body maintain their original forms, indicating no distortion or deformation even with the style transformation. This can be analyzed by observing the continuity of the guitar neck and body aligned with the image’s design elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B preserves the fine details of the guitar, such as the strings and pickups. These features are intact, and their details are clearly visible. The artistic transformation focuses on the background rather than altering these features. Thus, the guitar remains detailed without introduction of any unnatural textures.",
