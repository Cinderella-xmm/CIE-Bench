      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the color blocks on the comforter smoothly blended and textured to resemble natural fur, with no visible stitching artifacts or abrupt edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the comforter is designed to have a patchwork of color blocks that appear fluffy, resembling fur. However, upon close observation, there are visible stitching artifacts and abrupt edges outlining each block, which is typical of craft or artificial patchwork rather than natural fur without seams.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ear-shaped pillows have a natural, upright shape with soft leaf trims that appear securely and organically attached without floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ear-shaped pillows in Image B attempt to resemble large ears with leaf trims. However, they do not appear entirely natural; the leaf trims and edges are pronounced, showing misalignment with visible floating areas rather than an organic attachment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the branch-like legs thin, curved, and textured like natural wood, and do they connect correctly to the bed base without appearing broken or disconnected?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branch-like legs are intended to resemble wooden limbs. They are thin and curved, but they do not connect correctly to the bed base, appearing broken or disconnected, as if they were superimposed rather than naturally extending from the bed frame.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the red tail extend from the comforter with a rounded, fluffy shape and soft texture, and does it not intersect or clip through the fabric beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red tail in Image B is designed to extend from the comforter. It has a fluffy and rounded shape but upon closer inspection seems to clip through or intersect the fabric beneath it, disrupting the soft flow of the tail's texture.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows and lighting on the ears, tail, and branch legs consistent with the ambient light source in the room and do they align with the original bed's position and surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows and lighting in Image B on the added elements such as ears, tail, and legs do not align with the ambient light source evident in the room. They appear inconsistent with the shadows on other objects like the lamp and furniture, indicating a mismatch with the original ambient lighting.",
