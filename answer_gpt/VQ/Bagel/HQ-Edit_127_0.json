    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the textures of the owl’s feathers and the tree bark rendered with realistic detail and variation, without unnatural repetition or synthetic-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The owl's feathers in Image B are intricately detailed with varying shades and patterns, reflecting a natural and realistic appearance. The tree bark is depicted with complex textures and grooves. These details suggest a high level of realism without signs of artificial repetition or synthetic patterns typical of low-quality edits.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the moon depicted as a circular dotted diagram with evenly spaced dots and clear, legible labels indicating lunar phases, without jagged edges or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moon in Image B is represented by a circular dotted diagram. However, the labels around the diagram appear to lack clarity, with text that is not fully legible and might imply fictional or pseudo text rather than standard lunar phase indicators. The overall alignment and spacing appear intentional but not sufficiently informative for lunar phases.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the labels pointing to the owl’s talons and feathers placed without overlapping vital features, and do they use consistent line styles and text formatting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the labels around the owl seem to point towards features like the talons and feathers. The lines used are consistent, but the placement of the labels nearly interacts with the owl's detailed features, which could potentially cause overlap issues in intricate illustrations, though not immediately evident in this image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text box located at the bottom of the image, sized appropriately, and styled with earthy tones and readable typography that matches the botanical illustration theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text box at the bottom of Image B uses earthy colors and integrates with the botanical theme. However, the typography involves fictional or pseudo-latin text that doesn't provide meaningful information. Despite this, the style and integration appear visually cohesive with the rest of the illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the owl sit naturally on the tree branch with correct posture and claw positioning, and is the tree trunk and branch structure continuous and anatomically plausible without breaks or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is perched naturally on the tree branch, with claws wrapped around as expected, mimicking a realistic posture. The tree structure shows no evident breaks or warping, maintaining a plausible anatomy for both the owl and the tree branches.",
