    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the red helmet and blue cap on the paddles maintain proportional size relative to the paddle heads and avoid stretching or warping the underlying rubber surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paddles are illustrated with faces and accessories like helmets and caps. These adornments appear to be suitably proportioned in relation to the paddle heads, considering their cartoonish design. The cartoon style supports exaggerated features without implying any literal distortion of the physical form, therefore there's no sign of stretching or warping of the underlying rubber surface since it's an artistic representation rather than a realistic depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cartoon facial features and accessories on the paddles seamlessly integrated with no visible stitching, sharp edges, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases cartoon facial features and accessories that are smoothly drawn, with rounded edges typical of cartoon illustrations. The shading is consistent across the features and accessories, which suggests a cohesive design without visible outlining glitches, sharp edges, or inconsistent shading that may disrupt visual harmony.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the golden edges confined to the perimeter of the box lid and base, without extending into the interior or forming disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the golden edges are distinctly positioned along the perimeter of the treasure chest's lid and base. The interior of the chest showcases different designs but does not contain the golden edging. There are no signs of the edges extending inwards or breaking into disconnected segments, maintaining a coherent boundary.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the speech bubbles have pointed tails directed toward the paddles and avoid overlapping with the box or paddle handles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubbles above the cartoon paddles feature tails that point directly toward the paddle heads and not the handles or box itself. This directionality is typical for establishing a conversational link between the speech and the character (or object) depicted, avoiding any overlap that could visually misrepresent the speech source.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the treasure map background composed of uniformly drawn lines with no pixelation, aliasing, or irregular stroke widths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The treasure map seen in Image B is stylized with intentionally non-uniform hand-drawn lines typical in cartoon graphics. Despite its whimsical style, it maintains clean edges without pixelation or aliasing, which is consistent in appearance and suitable for printed media in such artistic depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the paddles tilted upward from the box but still supported by the handle slots, maintaining structural plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paddles are drawn as part of a cartoon scenario, where they are elevated above a treasure chest that loosely mimics structural dimensions similar to a box. In terms of cartoon design, they'd conceptually maintain their positioning due to the illustration style intended to showcase expression rather than adhere to physical structural plausibility seen in real-world engineering contexts.",
