      "question": "Does the outdoor camping scene seamlessly integrate with the toasters, maintaining consistent lighting and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters are positioned outdoors in a campsite. The lighting suggests bright sunlight which typically casts distinct shadows and highlights. Observing the toasters, they appear well lit, but the integration is flawed as the shadows and highlights on the toasters donâ€™t match the direction and intensity of the surrounding light, often causing the objects to appear disconnected from the environment.",

      "question": "Are the toasters placed naturally on the folding table without any visible distortion in the table's texture or structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters are sitting on a folding camping table. The table seems stable and correctly proportioned, with no visible warping or distortion in the structure or surface texture beneath the weight of the toasters, suggesting a natural placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the sunlight effects on the toast create realistic highlights and shadows on both the toast and surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunlight in Image B affects both the toast and toasters. However, the lighting on the toast does not seem to be deeply integrated with its surroundings, as the highlights and shadows lack the gradation and subtlety typical of real sunlight interaction, indicating unrealistic lighting effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the outdoor camping background and the foreground elements smooth, without any noticeable artifacts or missing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there appears to be a visible cut-out effect between the foreground of the toasters and the outdoor camping background. The transition is not smooth, and the difference in lighting and detail strongly indicates a lack of integration that draws attention to the edits.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the proportions and shapes of the toasters remained intact and physically plausible in the new outdoor camping scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The toasters in Image B maintain their proportions and shapes without distortion. The geometric and physical characteristics appear consistent and plausible compared to how they would look indoors, indicating successful preservation of their structure.",
