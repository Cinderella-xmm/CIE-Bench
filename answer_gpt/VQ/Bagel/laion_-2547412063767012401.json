      "question": "Do the armor elements on the central figure's torso and arms follow natural human body contours without causing distorted shapes or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central figure's armor in Image B consists of design elements such as plate armor that should naturally conform to the human body. By examining the figure, the armor does appear to follow the contours of the body, with no visible distortion or broken geometry. The plates align with expected anatomical lines, ensuring a complete and coherent appearance.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering the sun's position behind the figures, logical reasoning would suggest shadows should fall forward onto the rocks. In the scene depicted in Image B, the alignment of shadows seems consistent with this lighting condition. The silhouettes of the figures appear sharp and continuous, indicating accurate shadow positioning.",
