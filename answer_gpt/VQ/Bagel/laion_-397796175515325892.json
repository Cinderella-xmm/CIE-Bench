    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the church’s spire and rooflines smooth and continuous without jagged breaks or warped segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church's spire and rooflines are depicted with smooth, continuous lines typical of stylized art. This stylization smooths out any natural irregularities present in a real structure, like those that may be observed in Image A, where actual architectural features might show slight imperfections. Here, the spire and rooflines in Image B are purposefully designed to be smooth, which reflects a deliberate artistic choice to simplify and stylize the building's form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the left and right halves of the church’s façade mirror each other exactly, causing any misalignment in window positions or wall contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates an idealized version of the church, where symmetrical design principles are often employed for balance and aesthetic appeal. The left and right halves mirror each other, creating a perfect symmetry not governed by real-world construction constraints. Unlike Image A, where real architectural elements may cause natural asymmetry, the artistic depiction intentionally emphasizes symmetry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the metallic gold accent on the spire have a uniform, reflective appearance without clashing textures or unnatural glow spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic gold accents are designed to appear uniformly reflective, consistent with the stylized and simplified drawing approach. There are no varying textures or glow spots that would disrupt the consistent appearance of the material. The depiction avoids real-world material inconsistencies seen in Image A, where lighting and surface imperfections could create variations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the height of the spire proportionally balanced with the width and height of the church’s main body, avoiding extreme vertical stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, proportions are carefully controlled for visual harmony due to its artistic representation. The spire is drawn in balance with the main body, reflecting an ideal proportion that avoids any unrealistic vertical stretching. Unlike Image A, where real-world constraints could affect proportions, Image B adjusts them for aesthetic balance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the celestial background blend seamlessly with the top edge of the church and surrounding sky, without abrupt color shifts or floating objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stylized background where the celestial scene and the church's top edge are designed to integrate smoothly. The gradient of the sky colors progresses naturally, and celestial elements like stars and crescent moons are distributed harmoniously. This avoids the abrupt color changes or misplaced elements that may be present in a non-artistic representation like Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the window frames, arch designs, and roof tile patterns still visible and clearly defined in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows, arches, and roof tiles are simplified and stylized, meaning they lack the intricate detail that might be present in a photographic representation like Image A. The artistic depiction sacrifices detailed patterns for clarity and style, focusing on clear and bold lines to represent these elements instead.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is the artwork fully contained within the matte black frame, with no visible clipping or stretching at the borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the artwork within a matte black frame in a triptych setup. The church and celestial elements are all well-contained within the confines of the frames, with no evidence of clipping or stretching beyond the borders. This clear framing is a deliberate artistic presentation choice that contrasts with Image A, where no such framing is present.",
