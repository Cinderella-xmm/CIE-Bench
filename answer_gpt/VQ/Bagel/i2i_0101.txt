This integration is subtle, maintaining the natural look of Image B as a coherent piece of decor. The placement and font style blend well with the wood texture, avoiding any notable disruption to the overall authenticity of the scene. In comparison, Image A, which lacks the text, retains a very similar aesthetic ambiance, suggesting that the presence of the text does not disrupt the image's authenticity.",
