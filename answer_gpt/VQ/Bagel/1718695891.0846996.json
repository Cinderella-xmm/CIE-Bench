    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the fabric folds of the woman's dress clearly defined and consistent with natural draping behavior, without unnatural smoothing or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the woman's dress lacks the detailed representation of fabric folds as observed in natural draping. The design is simplified and stylized, consistent with an illustrative art style, such as that of a pin or charm, where features are often flattened and less detailed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the floral and curvilinear motifs in the background remain continuous and symmetrical, with no visible breaks or misalignments in the decorative framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background motifs are part of a stylized and simplified representation. The motifs appear continuous and symmetrical within this context, aligning with the design aesthetic typical of enamel pins or similar items, where motifs are intentionally simplified.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold trim along the perimeter of the image evenly applied, with consistent thickness and reflective properties that match the surrounding lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold trim is evenly applied around the perimeter, consistent with a uniform design typically found in metallic outline pins. The trim’s thickness is consistent, and though its reflective properties are highlighted by the uniform lighting of the depiction, it does not mimic natural lighting but rather a stylized representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the woman’s right hand maintain a natural position with five fingers properly aligned and no deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the woman's hand is abstract and lacks detailed features such as individual fingers. The design is stylized and simplified, so the hand does not maintain a natural position as would be expected in a realistic depiction, but this is consistent with the artistic style chosen.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors throughout the image uniformly balanced, with no sudden transitions or patches of unnatural saturation that suggest layering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are uniformly applied and balanced across the image. The color palette is consistent with what is expected in illustrative designs, without any sudden transitions or unnatural saturation, indicating a cohesive and error-free design layering.",
