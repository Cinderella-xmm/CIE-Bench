      "question": "Do the black-and-white coat patterns on the chibi cow match the original cow's patterns without introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi cow has a similar black-and-white coat that visually resembles patterns typically seen on cows, including those in Image A. Given that the chibi cow is an exaggerated, cartoon-like representation, some artistic liberties in the pattern shapes are expected for aesthetic purposes. Therefore, despite not being identical, the patterns have a consistent representation without introducing textures that appear unnatural for a stylized chibi character.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the cow leaning against the vintage television with its hooves on the screen look natural and structurally consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi cow is depicted in a playful manner, with its front hooves resting on the vintage TV. This matches a common animated or playful representation where animals interact with objects. The angle and positioning of hooves make sense in the context of a chibi or animated scene, where realism is not strictly adhered to but rather playful interactions are enhanced.",

      "question": "Does the chibi cow's facial expression convey a mischievous grin naturally without appearing distorted or unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi cow in Image B has an exaggerated grin that is characteristic of cartoon-style illustrations. The facial structure supports this expression without creating distortion, maintaining consistency with a typical chibi style where features are simplified and enhanced for expressiveness. Thus, the mischievous grin appears natural in the context of the cartoon style.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the grassy field and bright sky with 3D clouds integrate seamlessly with the cow and TV, avoiding any obvious artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grassy field and sky with 3D clouds provide a distinct backdrop that blends well with the cartoon style of the chibi cow and the TV. Visual consistency in terms of color palette and object outlines contributes to a seamless integration. There are no visible artifacts or inconsistencies that break this cohesion.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the chibi cow, vintage TV, and the environment create a whimsical and playful ambience without compromising visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition in Image B is deliberately crafted to evoke a whimsical and playful atmosphere. The chibi cow, with its exaggerated features and playful pose on the vintage TV, alongside the bright grassy field and sky, all contribute to an engaging and fantastical scene. This doesn't compromise visual credibility, as the artistic style chosen naturally supports this atmosphere.",
