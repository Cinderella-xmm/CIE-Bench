      "question": "Are the brass gears and levers on the desk properly aligned with the desk’s structure, showing no signs of floating, misshapen geometry, or unnatural material seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the brass gears and levers on the desk in Image B, they appear consistent with how mechanical components are traditionally depicted in steampunk designs. The connections between the gears and the desk show no signs of distortion or floating, as everything appears correctly attached and aligned. This suggests good integration with the desk structure. In Image A, there are no such mechanical components on the desk to compare, indicating these elements were added in the edit. The reasoning process involved confirming the presence of visual cues such as connection points and alignment with known depictions of machinery.",

      "question": "Do the modified books display consistent glowing effects without distorting their page edges or causing unnatural light bleeding into surrounding surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the books do not display glowing effects as the question suggests, instead, they are ordinary looking books without any visual effects. Therefore, there is no evidence of glowing effects to analyze further. In Image A, books are also present in stacks without glowing effects. Thus, given the absence of such modifications, the reasoning process concludes that the books are unaltered in terms of illumination or glow.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the holographic globe above the monitor clearly visible with proper depth and transparency, and does it cast natural shadows or reflections on the desk surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic globe in Image B is designed to appear as a 3D projection with visible transparency, but does not exhibit shadows or reflections on the desk surface. The visual intent of a hologram often includes depth and partial transparency, but natural shadows or reflections are not observed, given the technology depicted. This is consistent with world knowledge about holograms, which typically do not cast shadows or need reflections due to their nature. In Image A, no hologram is present above the monitor. Therefore, the answer relies on recognizing the typical characteristics depicted in holograms.",

      "question": "Are the newly added ornate frames around the windows seamlessly integrated with the existing window structure, without overlapping glass panes or creating distorted perspective lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornate frames around the windows are stylized to match the overall steampunk aesthetic. Upon close observation, they don’t overlap the glass panes or disrupt perspective lines, ensuring a seamless integration with the existing window structure. Image A also features window frames, emphasizing classical design without ornate additions. Comparison shows that in Image B, the added frames complement the style without causing visual distortion. Understanding the logic relies on recognizing accurate stylistic and perspective integration.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all edited elements (gears, glowing books, hologram, window frames) share consistent lighting and shadow behavior, avoiding abrupt changes in brightness or material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the edited elements like gears, hologram, and window frames seem to follow a cohesive lighting approach consistent with Image B's ambient moody lighting typical of steampunk design. The globe and gears are illuminated considering the desk's lighting, while the books do not exhibit glowing effects, maintaining a consistent style. In Image A, although books and gears aren’t present, are similar desk and curtain lighting techniques. Using design logic, the consistent application of lighting and materials ensures visual continuity throughout the image.",
