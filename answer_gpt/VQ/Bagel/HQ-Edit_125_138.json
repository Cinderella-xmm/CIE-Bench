    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the golden batik patterns on the dancer's dress clearly defined, continuous, and free from pixelation or jagged edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the batik patterns on the dress appear clear and continuous without visible pixelation or jagged edges. The patterns are seamlessly integrated into the dress fabric, exhibiting smooth contours typical of high-quality digital illustrations, indicating that the patterns are well-defined.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the line-drawn version of the temple maintain accurate tier alignment and structural symmetry without missing or distorted roof layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the line-drawn temple shows a symmetrical and accurate tier alignment, with each roof layer clearly defined and undistorted. This suggests a careful rendition of the temple structure, maintaining its architectural integrity in the illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the two guardian statues on either side of the pathway identical in size, pose, and position relative to the central temple axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guardian statues flanking the pathway are visually identical in size and pose. They are symmetrically positioned relative to the central temple axis, maintaining the balance typical of traditional architectural layouts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do both of the dancer’s hands show five fingers each with natural spacing, smooth contours, and no deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both of the dancer’s hands are depicted with five fingers each, with natural spacing and smooth contours. There is no visible deformation or extra digits, which reflects the artist's attention to anatomical detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text positioned in a way that does not overlap or obscure the dancer, temple, or guardian statues, and is it clearly readable without visual clutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is positioned above the dancer, temple, and statues. It stands separate from the main visual elements, ensuring no overlap or obstruction, and is legible without creating a sense of visual clutter.",
