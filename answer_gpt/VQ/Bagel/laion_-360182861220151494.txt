    "Question": "Q1: Are the character’s eyes in Panel 1 clearly narrowed and intense, with visible tension in the eyelids and pupils, and is the hand gripping the katana properly aligned with five distinct fingers showing natural curvature?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, Panel 1 depicts the character engaged in an action pose, which typically means tension in the facial expression and the grip. The narrowing of eyes signifies intensity or focus, often represented in visual media to display an emotion or concentration-driven reaction. The portrayal of fingers gripping weapons, like a katana, involves showing natural curvature and proper alignment to imply a realistic hold, unless stylized otherwise. Analyzing the hand indicates whether each finger is distinct and naturally positioned. In Image B, the depiction of such details appears accurate, indicating a proper expression and grip.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the character’s leaping pose in Panel 2 show correct leg extension and arm positioning consistent with forward momentum, and do the fiery trails originate naturally from the hair strands without overlapping into solid parts of the body?",
    "explanation": "In anime and manga, a leaping pose conveys dynamic movement by correctly extending limbs to suggest forward momentum. In Image B, Panel 2 must show the character's legs and arms positioned to enhance the sense of movement, usually by extension in the direction of leaping. Fiery trails associated with hair often enhance the action scene, requiring careful illustration to ensure that they emanate correctly from the hair and do not overlap solid body parts. In Image B, such dynamics in the pose and trail positioning appear consistent, emphasizing proper directionality and separation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the katana in Panel 3 correctly oriented forward without clipping through the character’s uniform or distorting the sleeve, and are the surrounding energy swirls continuous and free of pixelated or broken lines?",
    "explanation": "For a katana depicted in an action scene, correct orientation means its alignment does not interfere with clothing visual integrity. The katana should appear independent of the outfit, and sleeves should not look distorted due to overlap. In action-centric panels, energy effects surrounding or associated with the character need to be continuous and polished to maintain quality. In Image B, Panel 3, the katana’s position and the uniform detail check ensure the katana isn't clipping, and the energy effects are smoothly drawn without visible pixelation issues.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the backgrounds in all three panels retain their original vibrancy and contrast without color bleed into the character’s outline or loss of sharpness in the bold borders around her figure?",
    "explanation": "Evaluating the backgrounds requires observing the distinct separation between the character and the surrounding hues. Vibrancy and contrast must remain intact, implying no color bleed into the character. Image B needs to show clear, bold borders around the character against the vibrant background, signifying maintained sharpness. The use of contrast should avoid any overlap of color into character outlines, preserving the intended design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the character’s head, torso, and limbs proportionally consistent across all three panels, with no stretching or compression that alters the original anatomy or causes misalignment between body parts?",
    "explanation": "Consistency in proportion involves observing that the character maintains a similar anatomical layout across different panels. This check involves ensuring that the head, torso, and limbs are depicted consistently without exaggerated stretching or compression, which would be nonsensical visually and contextually. In Image B, all panels should present the character in consistent proportions, verifying a coherent anatomy depiction without misalignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
