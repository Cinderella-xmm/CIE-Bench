      "question": "Are the bold primary colors applied to the train's body consistent across all surfaces without visible color bleeding or mismatched tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is represented with bold primary colors as expected in a pop art style. Examining the train, the red and white colors applied to its body appear consistent across the visible surfaces. The colors are solid and evenly distributed, suggesting there is no color bleeding or mismatched tones. This consistency is a common characteristic of pop art imagery which relies on vibrant, solid colors to maintain clarity and impact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the halftone dot patterns on the train display consistent size, spacing, and alignment across all visible panels without distortion or clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The halftone dot patterns in Image B are a defining feature of the pop art style, meant to mimic the printing techniques of comic books. On the train, these patterns appear uniform across all visible panels, maintaining consistent size and spacing. There is no apparent distortion, clustering, or irregularity in alignment, which helps preserve the intended artistic style and ensures visual coherence across the train's panels.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes used to replace the barn’s wood texture aligned with the original architectural elements such as windows, doors, and roofline without breaking their structural boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the barn is depicted in a stylized manner with geometric shapes replacing the wood texture typical of such structures. The alignment of these shapes adheres closely to the architectural elements of the barn, such as windows, doors, and roofline. Examining these elements, they appear to fit within their original boundaries, suggesting that the integrity of the structure is preserved, even in this artistic representation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the graphic bursts representing foliage positioned in a way that respects the original spatial layout, with no overlapping or misplaced elements that contradict the scene’s depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the pop art version (Image B), the representation of foliage as graphic bursts should respect the spatial arrangement to maintain the scene's depth. The bursts are positioned in a manner that reflects their original locations relative to the tracks and buildings, avoiding contradictions in spatial depth. There is no overlapping or misplaced elements that would disrupt the perception of depth, indicating careful placement within the artistic constraints.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the black outlines around the train, barn, and foliage uniformly sharp, continuous, and free from gaps or misalignments at object edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering the style of Image B, strong black outlines are used to demarcate shapes and add distinctiveness in a pop art style. These outlines around the train, barn, and foliage appear uniformly sharp and continuous. The edges of objects are clearly articulated with no visible gaps or misalignments. This precision in outlining is crucial to retaining clarity and definition in the stylized image.",
