        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is depicted with consistent curl patterns and a volumetric continuity that aligns with typical stylized portrayals. The curls are uniformly spaced and maintain a smooth flow without any abrupt changes in thickness or volume, which would suggest a well-executed design coherent with common stylized figures.",
