      "question": "Do the edges and contours of the stapler maintain their smoothness without any jagged or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the edges and contours of both staplers appear smooth and well-defined. This is indicated by the consistent and uninterrupted flow of the lines, which align with the typical design of a stapler. No jagged edges or breaks are visible, suggesting that the rendering of the contours has been done properly without distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blue color and metallic finish of the stapler consistent across both the front and back views with no visible texture discrepancies or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue color of the staplers maintains a consistent saturation and tone across both views. The metallic parts, such as the staple head and plates, also show uniformity in texture and finish. There are no visible discrepancies or artifacts that disrupt the visual consistency, indicating that the finish remains even and coherent across both perspectives.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the mechanical components such as screws and hinges depicted accurately and consistently between the two views, avoiding any illogical positioning or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the mechanical components, including screws, depicted consistently between the side and front views. Their positioning is logical and aligns with typical stapler design, visible on both staplers in their respective views, without distortion or misalignment. This consistency ensures that the logical structure of the stapler is maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the stapler match the lighting conditions in both views, ensuring a believable three-dimensional effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B, the shadows and highlights on both staplers are coherent and align with the perceived lighting direction. The highlights are placed where the light would naturally hit, and shadows are consistent with areas likely to be less illuminated, providing a realistic three-dimensional appearance in both views.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the layout of the stapler's side-by-side views clear and uncluttered, with no distracting or misplaced elements disrupting the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side-by-side view of the staplers is straightforward and well-organized. There are no distracting elements or asymmetrically placed objects that could disrupt the clear visual flow. Both staplers are positioned to facilitate easy comparison, ensuring clarity in presentation.",
