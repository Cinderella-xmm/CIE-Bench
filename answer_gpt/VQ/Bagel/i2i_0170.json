      "question": "Are the clothing and bags of both women depicted with soft gradient blocks that retain their original shapes and proportions without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing and bags of the women are depicted with stylized, simple forms, using flat colors without gradients. While the shapes and proportions are maintained in a more abstract form, the style eschews the detail typical of soft gradient blocks. Given this stylized approach, no unnatural artifacts are introduced, and the integrity of the subjects is retained, accepting the stylistic choices.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the mannequins and their outfits inside the store window appear structurally coherent and visually plausible in terms of shape and material after the style conversion, without any noticeable distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents mannequins and their outfits in a simplistic, illustrative style rather than a realistic one. While their shapes and positions remain coherent in this abstract portrayal, there are deliberate deviations from realistic textures due to the editorial design. Hence, this choice maintains structural coherence without introducing distortion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the storefront maintain its original architectural details, such as the frame and tiles, without any visible distortion or introduction of non-natural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B stylistically transforms the storefront into a minimalistic background without distinct architectural features like the frame or tiles noted in Image A. This design choice does not introduce distortions but creates a new context and does not carry over architectural details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the texture of the cobblestone pavement represented naturally with soft gradients, maintaining the structural integrity and visual coherence without any loss of detail or unnatural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture of the cobblestone pavement in Image B is completely transformed into a minimalistic white background devoid of original detail. There is no representation of cobblestone texture, resulting in loss of structural integrity compared to Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the lighting effects and shadows in the image convincingly portrayed with soft gradient blocks, ensuring they contribute to the overall realism and natural appearance without breaking the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, lighting effects and shadows are abstracted to solid colors within the stylized illustration. This editorial choice lacks the gradients but maintains visual flow within this illustrative context. It does not contribute to realism as typically expected with soft gradient effects.",
