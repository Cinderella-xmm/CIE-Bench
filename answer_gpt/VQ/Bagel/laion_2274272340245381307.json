      "question": "Is the anthropomorphic teddy bear scientist fully integrated into the image with smooth contours, consistent line weight, and no visible seams or misaligned textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The anthropomorphic teddy bear scientist in image B appears to be well-drawn and integrated into the image with smooth contours and consistent line weight. The character does not exhibit visible seams or misaligned textures, which suggests that the character design is cohesive and professionally executed, matching the overall 2D chalkboard art style of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lab equipment illustrations (e.g., beakers, test tubes) proportionally accurate, geometrically intact, and aligned with the hand-drawn chalk style without jagged edges or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lab equipment illustrations in image B, such as beakers and test tubes, are proportionally accurate and geometrically intact, consistent with the intended hand-drawn chalk style. They are free from jagged edges or unnatural shading, maintaining a uniform and coherent visual theme throughout the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all scientific symbols and doodles (such as planets, rockets, and formulas) have intact geometric forms, proper alignment, and no overlapping artifacts or misplaced lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The doodles, including planets, rockets, and formulas, in image B exhibit intact geometric forms and are properly aligned. There are no overlapping artifacts or misplaced lines, ensuring that each element maintains visual integrity and fits seamlessly within the chalkboard theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the typography (e.g., \"JOYFUL\", \"CURIOSITY\") clearly legible, stylistically consistent with the doodles, and free from blurring, stretching, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the primary typography is not regarding 'JOYFUL' or 'CURIOSITY', but rather the other terms visible, which remain clearly legible and stylistically consistent with the surrounding doodles. While the playful style may intentionally mimic childlike writing, it maintains clarity and is free from blurring, stretching, or noticeable misalignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the animal characters (e.g., bear, rabbit) exhibit correct limb positioning, proportional body parts, and logical interaction with nearby objects without unnatural poses or deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The animal characters in image B, specifically the teddy bears, display correct limb positioning and proportional body parts. They logically interact with nearby objects, like the test tubes and flasks, without exhibiting unnatural poses or deformations, maintaining visual coherence and narrative logic in their depiction.",
