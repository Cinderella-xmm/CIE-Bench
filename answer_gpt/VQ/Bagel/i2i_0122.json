      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the outdoor café table appear to have a natural wood texture and color, consistent with the existing glass cups?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The café table in Image B appears to have a wooden texture, similar to a common outdoor furniture material. The color of the wood is a natural brown, which typically harmonizes with the warm tones of the liquid in the glass cups, suggesting a coherent design aesthetic that matches real-world settings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the snowy cabin in the background seamlessly integrated into the scene without noticeable edges or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cabin and snow in Image B appear well integrated into the background, with gradual transitions between the snow and cabin edges. The lighting on the cabin matches the scene, and there are no visible signs of artificial manipulation like unnatural lines or color mismatches.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the reflections and shadows on the glasses match the lighting conditions of the new snowy cabin background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the single glass on the outdoor table shows a shadow consistent with a light source that matches the snowy scene's lighting, suggesting accurate light interplay. The background’s ambient lighting does not contradict the reflections observed on the glass surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sizes and proportional relationships between the two glasses and the outdoor café table natural and physically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only one glass visible on the outdoor café table. The proportion of the glass relative to the table appears natural and plausible, as it fits common dimensions expected for a table used for outdoor dining settings with typical beverage glass sizes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the steam rising from the glasses look natural and consistent with the new outdoor café setting without any artificial interruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the single glass does not show steam rising, which is consistent with an outdoor cold setting shown by the snowy background. The absence of steam is logical, as colder outdoor temperatures would likely reduce visible steam production.",
