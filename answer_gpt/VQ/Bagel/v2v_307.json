      "question": "Does the chibi-style representation of the bandage inside the packaging maintain structural coherence without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style representation of the bandage character is designed to look like a miniature figurine enclosed in a box. The bandage character has been designed with exaggerated features and stitches similar to those seen on bandages, maintaining a cohesive theme with the realistic bandage shown outside the box. The texture and features of the chibi figure are consistent with the stylized design, avoiding unnatural distortions and integrating well with the packaging design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fabric texture and adhesive surface of the realistic bandage outside the packaging depicted with high detail and free from artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the realistic bandage outside the packaging appears to have a precise representation with visible fabric texture and adhesive surface. The details such as texture and shading are clear and realistic, showing no signs of digital artifacts or blurring that would detract from its quality. This high level of detail enhances its realistic appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the packaging design, including the isometric perspective and the label \"HEALING ESSENTIALS,\" integrate naturally into the scene without disrupting visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging design includes an isometric perspective that gives a three-dimensional appearance to the box, and the label 'HEALING ESSENTIALS' is prominently featured. The packaging is integrated well with the figurine, providing a seamless look that matches the theme of the bandage. The label and perspective align correctly with the rest of the packaging, maintaining visual credibility and coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and placement of the chibi-style bandage within the packaging logically consistent with the realistic bandage outside, avoiding any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style bandage character is placed inside the packaging, and its proportions relative to the box appear consistent and well-balanced. While the character has exaggerated features typical of a chibi-style, the scaling and placement are logical given the size of the packaging and corresponding to the realistic bandage outside the box. This consistency avoids any unrealistic distortions in the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the materials used for the packaging and the realistic bandage appear natural and consistent with their intended purpose, without any obvious unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the materials used for the packaging and the realistic bandage exhibit high detail and quality. The packaging looks like a typical box for collectible figures, complete with a window to display the object inside. Similarly, the realistic bandage has a textured fabric appearance indicative of its real-world counterpart. Both the packaging and the bandage features are depicted without unnatural artifacts, supporting their intended purpose and appearance.",
