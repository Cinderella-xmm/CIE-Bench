      "question": "Do the mechanical sentinels replacing the buses have intact geometric shapes, smooth surfaces, and consistent glowing blue underlights without visible rendering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical sentinels depicted in Image B have geometrically consistent shapes and smooth surfaces that maintain a high level of detail. The underlights are consistently glowing blue, creating a cohesive look without visible rendering artifacts. This showcases a stylized futuristic design. The visual design is distinct from conventional buses, suggesting a fictional or advanced technological theme.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the golden automaton version of Big Ben have uniform metallic texture, proper vertical alignment, and a centrally placed cosmic eye clockface without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of Big Ben features a golden automaton version with a uniform metallic texture that is visually consistent across the structure. The vertical alignment of the tower appears proper, maintaining a coherent architectural form. The clockface as a 'cosmic eye' is centrally placed, and does not exhibit distortion. The design appears fantastical and well-executed.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the energetic vines wrapped around the Houses of Parliament following plausible growth patterns, maintaining consistent glow, and not intersecting through solid architectural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vines in Image B demonstrate dynamic, spiral growth patterns that are plausible for the theme. There is a consistent glow emitted from the vines, contributing to the surreal atmosphere without breaking the laws of physics by passing through solid architectural elements like walls or towers, maintaining visual coherence.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the airships in the sky properly scaled, positioned at a reasonable altitude, and displaying iridescent surfaces without harsh edges or shadow mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The airships in Image B are scaled to fit the scene's proportions, positioned at an appropriate altitude for aerial vehicles within such an imaginary cityscape. Their surfaces appear iridescent without harsh edges, blending into the sky naturally. Shadow continuity is maintained, creating a harmonious visual effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements (underlights, cosmic eye, vines, airships) blend with the ambient lighting of the scene without creating overly bright spots or unnatural contrast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing elements such as the underlights, cosmic eye, vines, and airships are designed to seamlessly blend into the ambient lighting, maintaining a balanced illumination throughout the scene. The transitions between light sources and the environment are naturally integrated, avoiding overly bright spots or unnatural contrast.",
