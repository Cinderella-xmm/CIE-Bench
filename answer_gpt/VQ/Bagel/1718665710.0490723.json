      "question": "Is the head proportionally enlarged without distorting facial features or flattening the curls of the hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The head of the chibi character is proportionately large as is common in chibi art style, designed to accentuate cuteness. This enlargement does not distort facial features; in fact, it enhances them. The curls of the hair retain their rounded and voluminous texture, characteristic of cartoon designs.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, black outlines encapsulate the details clearly and are uniformly thick, which is typical for chibi style illustrations intended to create distinguished and bold separations between different elements such as the skin, hair, and armor. This helps in unnecessary blending and maintains sharpness.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor in the edited image has glossy reflections and smooth transition between shades, which is typical of vector or high-quality digital designs enhancing the appearance of metal surfaces. There is no visible pixelation or repeating patterns that would otherwise disrupt the armorâ€™s aesthetic appeal.",
