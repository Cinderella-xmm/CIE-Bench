      "question": "Are the facial features added over the star motif proportionally aligned and integrated without distorting the star’s shape or creating unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual integration of any additions over the star motif needs to be seamless to appear natural. Analyzing the star motif, there is no visible distortion, misalignment, or unnatural edging around it, indicating successful integration. This means the added elements over the star are proportionally aligned and do not compromise the motif's original shape.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the motion lines are analyzed for their consistency and smoothness. These lines match the jersey's design language and are free from visible pixelation or clipping artifacts. The smooth strokes complement the overall aesthetic, maintaining design integrity.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By analyzing Image B, it is clear that the newly added elements such as motion lines and text are designed consistently with the original color scheme. The use of blue, white, red, and gray is consistent throughout, and no additional unexpected colors are present, ensuring design coherency.",

      "question": "Does the fabric texture of the jersey, including the repeated \"DALLAS\" pattern and mesh-like sections, remain intact and undistorted even in areas near the added facial features and motion lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jersey's texture in Image B, including the 'DALLAS' pattern and mesh-like sections, retains its original intactness and clarity. There is no distortion or alteration evident, even near areas where additional features like motion lines have been added, ensuring the initial design elements remain preserved.",
