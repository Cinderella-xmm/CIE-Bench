      "question": "Does the keychain version of the character maintain the same proportions and colors as the original image, without any visible distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain features the character Psyduck with consistent proportions to its typical depiction in various media. The character has its iconic large, round eyes, a wide, flat duckbill, and an overall rounded body shape, similar to Image A. The colors appear vibrant and consistent with the original design of the character, showing no unnatural textures or distortions. Keychains often simplify or stylize the design for practical purposes, which might alter proportions slightly, but the essence of the character is maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the keychain appear naturally placed on the desk with appropriate shadows and reflections, indicating a realistic interaction with the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain of Psyduck is placed on a wooden desk. The shadows underneath the keychain are soft and consistent with where a light source might logically be positioned, providing depth and a sense of realism. There are no glaring inconsistencies suggesting it was unnaturally added to the scene. This attention to shadow and light interactions helps the object appear naturally integrated with its surroundings.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the books and glasses placed next to the keychain rendered with realistic textures and a consistent level of detail, without any obvious artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book has a textured fabric cover with detailed grain, and the glasses frame is shiny with a tortoiseshell pattern. These elements are presented with realistic textures and detail, capturing how such objects typically look. There are no visible artifacts or inconsistencies in the rendering of these items, suggesting they are realistically created or captured within the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the keychain and its neighboring objects (books, glasses, desk) crisp and well-defined, with no signs of blending or breaking apart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain, book, and glasses all feature distinct, clean edges. The lines around the keychain are smooth and well-defined, as are those around the book and glasses. There are no signs of edge blending, pixilation, or other distractions that could suggest a lack of sharpness or editing flaws. This clarity contributes to the overall quality and realism of the composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the books and glasses exhibit proper orientation and placement on the desk, reflecting typical real-world scenarios where they would be found?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the book, keychain, and glasses on the desk is logical and practical, reflecting common scenarios of everyday desk arrangements. The book is angled neatly, and the glasses are placed nearby as if they had been set down casually, consistent with how one might handle such objects. These considered placements enhance the realistic setup of the scene.",
