      "question": "Does the airplane maintain its structural consistency despite being transformed into a stylized 3D cartoon version with chibi features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane is presented in a chibi style, which is characterized by exaggerated and cute features: oversized eyes, a smiling face, and a simplified structure. Analyzing Image B, world knowledge about chibi attributes indicates a deliberate alteration for stylistic purposes, implying that structural consistency in terms of real-world accuracy is not the goal. The airplane looks intact in its cartoon form, maintaining a coherent design consistent with chibi art style.",
