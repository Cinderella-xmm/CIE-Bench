    "Question": "Q3: Does the medieval forest path background align naturally with the anthropomorphic bull in terms of lighting and perspective?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B, depicted as a medieval forest path, aligns well with the bull in terms of both lighting and perspective. The lighting on the bull matches the ambient lighting from the background, and the perspective allows the viewer to perceive depth, enhancing realism. Thus, the bull fits naturally into this environment.",
