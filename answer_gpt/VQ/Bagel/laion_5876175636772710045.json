      "question": "Does the brocade doublet on the man have consistent texture, visible pattern details, and natural fabric folds that conform to his body shape without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brocade doublet of the man is examined for texture, pattern details, and how it fits his body shape. The doublet should display a consistent weave or embroidered pattern, with visible details that reflect a realistic brocade appearance. The fabric should have natural folds and creases that align with his posture and movements without appearing distorted or artificially smooth. Upon analysis, the doublet displays a consistent texture and pattern, and the fabric folds are naturally aligned with the body shape, suggesting no distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the flowing skirt of the womanâ€™s gown composed of layered, translucent fabric with natural ruffles and soft gradients, and do the jeweled accents appear embedded rather than pasted on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's gown is evaluated for the characteristics of the fabric and embellishments. A layered, translucent fabric would show natural ruffles and soft gradients of color, indicating a delicate and dynamic material. Additionally, jeweled accents should look as though they are sewn into the fabric, rather than appearing as an overlay. Upon inspection, the skirt appears dense without the intended translucency or soft gradient, and the jeweled accents seem superficially placed, suggesting the contrary.",

      "question": "Do the marble floor tiles display continuous veining patterns and subtle reflections, and are the chandeliers structurally sound with clear crystal elements and warm light diffusion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features marble floor tiles and chandeliers, which are assessed for realism and detail. For marble tiles, noticeable continuous veining and subtle sheen reflecting lighting should be present, indicating a polished and natural stone surface. Chandeliers should have intricate structure, clarity in the crystal details, and light diffusion reflecting a warm ambiance. The image shows continuous and realistic veining in the floor; chandeliers appear well-constructed with detailed crystal elements and warm light, confirming good design and execution.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the dancers soft and directional, consistent with overhead chandeliers, and do they blend smoothly into the surrounding environment without sharp boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, dancers' shadows are considered for their softness, direction, and consistency with overhead light sources like chandeliers. Shadows should have soft edges and taper gently rather than showing stark lines, with directionality aligning with lights above. On analysis, the shadows appear somewhat sharp and not entirely consistent with a soft, blended lighting environment, indicating an artificial addition or inconsistency in shadow execution.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do both dancers' hands show five fingers each with natural joint alignment, smooth skin texture, and no overlapping or missing digits at the point of contact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, focus is given to the dancers' hands, checking for anatomical correctness, including that each hand shows five individually discernible fingers. The joints should appear aligned correctly, and the skin texture should be smooth and continuous. Upon detailed observation, the hands have natural alignment of joints and smooth texture with no digits missing or awkward overlapping, suggesting accurate representation.",
