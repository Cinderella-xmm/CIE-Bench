      "question": "Does the chibi version preserve distinct facial features like hair texture and glasses in a way that remains visually consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the chibi character is an animated representation which simplifies and stylizes features. Despite being cartoonish, it maintains key identifiers like the hairstyle and glasses as seen in the original character's depiction. The hair is drawn with simple lines and shapes typical for a chibi style, and the glasses are a notable accessory that matches the character's iconic look. Therefore, even though the artistic style differs, the recognizable elements are present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scarf and the wand being held in the hand rendered with natural textures that match the other elements in the chibi figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi representation, both the scarf and wand are drawn in a simplified, stylized manner typical for this type of art. Chibi figures do not focus on realistic textures like a photo or detailed animation would. Therefore, the scarf is a flat color representation with simple striping, and the wand is straightforward with minimal detail, consistent with the chibi aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand holding the wand proportionate with the rest of the chibi figure's body, and does it look anatomically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi characters are known for their disproportionate features, such as oversized heads and minimized limbs. In the second image, the hand holding the wand is small compared to the head and fits the chibi style. The fingers are not detailed, but this is typical for the style. It looks suitable for the artistic representation despite not being anatomically correct in realistic terms.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the chibi character blend naturally into the wooden background without any visible artifacts or unnatural shadows that disrupt the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character in the second image is lying over a palm, which slightly tilts a natural environment. There are no evident artifacts or mismatched shadows that make the character feel out of place. The color and lighting are consistent, allowing the figure to sit plausibly within the context of being held. However, as an animated version, perfect blending with a photo-realistic wooden background may not be expected but it does not display obvious inconsistencies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scarf and tie designed with coherent shapes that do not introduce any broken or distorted geometries, preserving the chibi aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scarf in the chibi image is depicted with simple stripes and an uncomplicated outline, consistent with chibi art style. The tie, while not explicitly shown, would follow the artistic tendency for minimalism and straightforward representation. Both elements maintain the shapes expected for the intended style, without any notable distortion except for the stylistic exaggeration, inherently preserved in chibi art.",
