      "question": "Does the transformed character have correctly proportioned limbs and head with no signs of unnatural stiffness or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character displays proportions that are consistent with typical doll design characteristics. The head, torso, and limbs appear proportioned similarly to traditional porcelain or decorative dolls. The limbs, although slightly rigid due to the style, do not exhibit unnatural distortions. Dolls, unlike animate figures, often are designed to showcase slight stiffness as a part of structural integrity.",

      "question": "Are the layers of the lace dress clearly defined with natural folds and shadows, and do they interact with light in a believable way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lace dress showcases multiple layers with detailed lacework. The dress is designed in a historically classic style, where each layer has visible folds and intricate lace patterns. The interaction with light is relatively believable, with shadows complementing the depth and texture, making the fabric appear genuine.",

      "question": "Does the wooden sewing kit have visible wood texture, appropriate internal components, and correct shadow alignment with the surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sewing kit in Image B portrays a wooden texture characteristic of fine crafted furniture. However, due to the blurring of this section, it is difficult to provide a detailed assessment of the internal components and shadow alignment. The texture and shadow alignment with the surrounding objects appears coherent as per the visible parts.",

      "question": "Is the porcelain figurine rendered with a smooth, reflective surface and accurate three-dimensional shape that matches the scale of the original cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no porcelain figurine depicted in Image B that mirrors the scale or placement equivalent to the original cat in Image A. Therefore, the element expected from the question is not visually present in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the oil lamp have a structurally sound design with visible glass and metal parts, and does it emit light that creates soft, realistic illumination and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict an oil lamp that matches the original's portrayal in Image A. The question refers to an element not evident in the edited version provided. Thus, no assessment can be made about its illumination or structural features.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rocking chair in Image B is uniformly structured, appropriately scaled beneath the character, in line with common dimensions found in rocking chairs. It is positioned stably with clear structural integrity, no bending of legs or missing joints noted.",
