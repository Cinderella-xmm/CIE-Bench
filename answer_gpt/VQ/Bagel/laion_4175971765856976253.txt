    "Question": "Q1: Does the isometric packaging box have consistent edges, proper depth cues, and accurate alignment with the toy figures without visible warping or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "From the visual cues in Image B, the packaging box seems to be aligned correctly, with straight edges and proper depth cues, suggesting an isometric perspective. The alignment of the figures within the box appears coherent without visible warping or misalignment. The perspective and depth in Image B seem consistent, offering a realistic box display without noticeable distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the chibi-style figures inside the box proportionally consistent with typical chibi design rules (e.g., large heads, short limbs) and do they retain identifiable features of the original car and robot?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figures within the box are not chibi-style. Instead, they have a realistic proportion with typical humanoid figure features, larger bodies, and normal-sized limbs, aligning with the robot design more than a typical chibi character. They do not follow the large head and short limb characteristic of chibi design, showing that the figures depicted aren't in chibi style.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the mini tool set, interchangeable helmets, and gear base clearly defined, properly scaled, and positioned without floating or clipping through other elements inside the box?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, no mini tool set, interchangeable helmets, or gear base is visible inside the box. The contents feature only the two robot figures and a small chibi character illustration outside the box. Since there are no floating tools or helmets, no inconsistencies in scaling or position within the box are observed, as these elements don't exist.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the external surfaces of the car and robot exhibit consistent metallic textures with natural highlights and reflections, without visible artifacts like blotches or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays two robot figures with metallic textures on their surfaces, showing consistent detailing on their armor but not featuring the car shown in Image A. The textures appear quite uniform with some natural highlights, but no obvious blotches or jagged edges are visible in this view. Instead, the figures maintain a consistent metallic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the reflections and lighting on the showcase surface consistent with the direction of light and the materials of the figures, without unnatural glare or shadow mismatches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to follow a consistent direction, as the metallic parts of the figures reflect light naturally, without unnatural glare or shadow mismatches. The positioning of figures within the box and the lighting seem coherent, with the highlights supporting an appropriate reflection corresponding to an assumed light source, maintaining a visually believable appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
