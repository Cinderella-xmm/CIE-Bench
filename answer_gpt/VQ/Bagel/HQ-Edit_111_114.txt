    "Question": "Q1: Are the limbs of the man and the components of the scooter proportionally coherent and free from geometric distortion such as elongated arms, bent knees, or misaligned wheels?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man's limbs and the scooter's components appear in proportion and free from visible distortion. The arms are correctly aligned with the scooter handles, and the wheels are aligned and proportional to the scooter body. Comparing with Image A, the proportions and alignment in Image B seem consistent, maintaining a natural and coherent appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the sepia tones cover all areas evenly without visible color banding, blotchy patches, or loss of detail in textures like fabric, stone, or foliage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sepia tone is applied uniformly across the entire image. The details in the man's clothing, the stone pavement, and the surrounding foliage are preserved without losing detail or showing any blotchy patches or color banding. This uniformity suggests an even application of sepia tones compared to Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the edges of the image softly degraded with a smooth transition into white, without abrupt lines or visible masking artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a smooth transition into a white border from the main image, without any harsh lines or visible artifacts. The degradation is consistent with what is usually seen in artwork designed to mimic parchment or aged materials. This smooth blending from the image into the border contrasts with the more detailed edges of Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the art-nouveau frame surround the image without overlapping or cutting through the man’s face, scooter, or any background structures?",
    "explanation": "The art-nouveau frame in Image B is correctly placed around the image, without overlapping or interrupting crucial elements such as the man, the scooter, or the background structures. It complements the image without interfering with its contents, which is not present in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the blank writing area located directly beneath the image, aligned horizontally, and free from warping or interference with the scooter’s base or ground line?",
    "explanation": "The blank writing area in Image B is positioned directly below the image and is horizontally aligned. There is no distortion such as warping, and it doesn't interfere with the scooter's base or the ground line, leaving ample space for writing. This feature is unique to Image B compared to the uninterrupted ground line in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the parchment texture appear uniformly across the image without causing blurring, ghosting, or obscuration of fine details like the man’s beard or window shutters?",
    "explanation": "The parchment texture in Image B is consistent, maintaining clarity in fine details like the fabric's texture, architectural elements, and other components. There is no evidence of blurring or ghosting that might obscure details, unlike Image A, which retains more naturalistic textural details.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the postcards arranged in a stack with realistic shadows, overlapping edges, and twine wrapped around them in a way that suggests physical binding?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no postage or postcard elements present within this particular image itself to analyze. Image A focuses solely on the scene with the man on the scooter. Therefore, this particular aspect is not applicable here.",
    "answer": "No"
