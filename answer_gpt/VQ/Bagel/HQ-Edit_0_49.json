      "question": "Is the teapot proportionally scaled down while maintaining its original shape, surface details, and structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot appears to be a miniature version but retains its original shape, intricate surface details, and overall structural coherence. This indicates careful proportional scaling. Despite being small, the teapot's ornate design and form, seen in the original, have been preserved, showing attention to detail in maintaining its appearance while adjusting the size.",

      "question": "Are the porcelain cups arranged around the base in a balanced, non-overlapping manner, and do they appear to be made of realistic ceramic material with appropriate reflections and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cups are arranged neatly around the teapot's base, without overlapping one another, creating a balanced composition. The cups show realistic ceramic properties, evidenced by the smooth surface, subtle reflections, and shadows consistent with typical ceramic material behavior in light.",

      "question": "Do the new engravings on the elevated surface match the existing decorative patterns in style and depth, without appearing pixelated, duplicated, or unnaturally enhanced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features engravings on the teapot that match the original decorative patterns in style and depth. They appear consistent with the ornate design and show no signs of pixelation, duplication, or any unnatural enhancement, maintaining a coherent and authentic look.",

      "question": "Do the steam spirals rise smoothly from the teapot’s spout and lid area, exhibiting soft edges, proper translucency, and consistent lighting interaction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steam spirals emanate smoothly from the teapot’s spout and lid area, exhibiting soft, well-defined edges. The spirals demonstrate proper translucency characteristic of steam, and they interact consistently with lighting, adding to the realism without any harsh or artificial appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the glass dome show accurate light refraction and surface reflections, allowing clear visibility of the teapot and surrounding elements without visual distortion or artificial glare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B exhibits accurate light refraction and reflections on its surface. It allows clear visibility of the teapot and the surrounding cups without introducing distortion or glare that would detract from the visual clarity. The glass appears realistic, enhancing the elegance of the setup without compromising visibility.",
