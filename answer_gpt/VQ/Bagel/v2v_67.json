      "question": "Are the sunglasses on the horse's face free of unnatural textures and artifacts, maintaining a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses on the horse's face are part of a cartoonish or chibi-style representation rather than a realistic one. This setting inherently alters the textures and artifacts to match the toy-like aesthetic rather than maintaining a natural or realistic appearance as seen in Image A. The toy horse in Image B does not present unnatural textures because its stylized design implies a different expectation. Therefore, within the context of Image Bâ€™s artistic style, the sunglasses are consistent and appear appropriate.",

      "question": "Does the horse's facial structure maintain structural consistency and visual credibility despite the addition of sunglasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's facial structure is simplified into a toy-like design, which fits the artistic choice of the edited image. This means structural consistency is achieved within the style of the image rather than matching natural anatomical detail. The sunglasses are part of this cartoonish style and do not disrupt the visual credibility of this toy aesthetic. As such, given the styling used, the horse's facial structure in Image B maintains its consistency and credibility.",

      "question": "Are the horse's fur texture and details preserved without any loss or unnatural artifacts introduced by the sunglasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a plastic-like toy model of a horse, which does not aim to capture fur texture realistically. The stylized effect means the horse has a smooth surface, typical of a toy, rather than detailed fur. Hence, there are no unnatural artifacts introduced by the sunglasses as the image is consistent with its own toy-like art style. Thus, given Image B's context, the absence of fur texture is not due to a loss but rather a deliberate aesthetic choice.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sunglasses' material and reflections appear realistic and consistent with the lighting conditions of the sunset scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses on the toy horse are stylized, and while reflections are implied through attentively designed shading, they are not meant to mimic realism but to complement the toy-like appearance. Compared to Image A, where reflections would need to be more realistic, Image B embraces an artistic liberty consistent with its design. Therefore, given this context, they appear consistent within the sunset scene backdrop.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the horse's eyes visible and undistorted under the sunglasses, preserving their natural shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toy horse's eyes are represented as stylized and cartoonish, consistent with its overall design, and they are positioned accurately under the sunglasses without distortion. The artistic style in this image means the sunglasses fit within this design, ensuring the eyes, despite being hidden, align correctly within the toy-like features. Compared to Image A, the reflection and visual integration are consistent with the overall theme.",
