    "Question": "Q1: Do the transformed wings retain smooth, continuous petal shapes that follow natural curvature and avoid jagged or fragmented edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wings have been transformed into leaf shapes. Upon examination, these leaves have smooth edges and follow natural contours typical of foliage, avoiding jagged or fragmented edges. The process involves visual assessment of the outlines and comparison to natural shapes known from world knowledge.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the leaf designs on the wings detailed, evenly distributed, and free from unnatural pixelation or repeating patterns that suggest digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wings' leaf designs show intricate detailing with distinct veins and shading that resembles natural leaves. There is no visible pixelation or repeating patterns that typically indicate digital artifacts. This analysis is based on the inspection of texture smoothness and natural color transitions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the tendrils extending from the antennae curve smoothly and taper gradually, resembling natural plant growth rather than sharp, mechanical lines?",
    "explanation": "The tendrils in Image B emanate from the antennae with a fluid and elegant curve, resembling botanical tendrils seen in vines or similar plants. They gradually taper and do not exhibit characteristics of mechanical or artificial lines, such as abrupt angles or isolated segments.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the small blossoms at the wing edges and foot similar in color, texture, and size to the surrounding flowers in the meadow, and do they attach seamlessly without floating or clipping issues?",
    "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the small blossoms incorporated at the wing edges and foot visually resemble the surrounding flowers in color and texture, displaying harmony within the meadow setting. Their attachment appears seamless without signs of floating or clipping, suggesting cohesive integration into the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the butterfly’s body transformed into a straight, slender stalk that connects naturally to the head and base, with no visible breaks or misaligned segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly’s body is modified into a plant stem-like structure, connecting the head and base without any breakage or misalignment. The visual check confirms a consistent, slender form typical of plant stalks, following natural continuity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
