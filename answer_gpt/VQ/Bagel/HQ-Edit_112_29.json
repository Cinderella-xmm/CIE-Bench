    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the ship retain its original structural shape and proportion when rendered as part of a spherical globe, without visible warping or stretching of the hull or sails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the ship in Image B, it is placed inside the glass dome and looks slightly distorted, typical of objects viewed through curved surfaces like a glass sphere. The visual effect exaggerates certain features due to the curvature, especially vertically. In Image A, the ship appears naturally proportioned without distortion. The spherical globe in Image B shows signs of warping, typical of objects enclosed in curved glass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass dome transparent with realistic reflections and refractions, and does the wooden base display natural wood grain and intricate compass engravings without pixelation or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome looks realistic in terms of transparency, showing reflections and refraction effects typical of glass. The wooden base displays intricate engravings and a natural wood grain, which appear well-rendered without pixelation or obvious texture repetition. This indicates attention to detail and realistic rendering of materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sea creatures clearly visible beneath the ship, properly scaled, and positioned in a manner consistent with underwater motion, without appearing floating unnaturally or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sea creatures under the ship are visually clear and scaled to fit the scene within the globe. They are positioned in a way that suggests underwater motion, surrounded by flowing water, consistent with the immersive environment presented in the glass dome. The overall composition maintains realism, without unnatural or distorted appearances.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sails exhibit fine fabric details such as wrinkles and weave patterns that align with the lighting direction and do not show unnatural seams or repeating patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sails show detailed fabric textures with visible wrinkles and patterns, which align with the lighting direction within the scene. The quality of the fabric depiction ensures an organic look, with no unnatural seams or repeating patterns visible, enhancing the realism of the sails.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the internal clouds smoothly shaped and distributed within the dome without clipping into the ship or glass surface, and do they have soft edges and luminous quality consistent with being lit from above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds within the dome are smoothly shaped and distributed, maintaining a comfortable distance from the ship and dome surfaces. Their edges appear soft and the luminous quality suggests they are lit from above, which aligns with typical cloud lighting effects. The clouds are well-integrated into the scene without visible clipping or inconsistencies.",
