    "Question": "Q1: Do the wave patterns along the shoreline consist of smooth, continuous geometric curves without jagged or disconnected segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wave patterns are depicted using stylized geometric shapes. The curves are smooth and continuous without any jagged or disconnected sections. The depiction is abstract, resembling art deco or retro travel posters which often feature fluid lines and shapes. This design choice eliminates any indication of irregularity or disruption in the wave patterns.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the palm trees along the right side of the beach represented as clean, straight vertical lines without irregular gaps or misplaced branches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the palms are illustrated using a graphic style that emphasizes vertical lines and silhouettes. These are rendered with clean, straight vertical lines with no evident gaps or misplaced branches, consistent with the outlined, abstract nature of the image. The depiction is uniform, reflecting a stylized interpretation typical of streamlined graphic representations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the clouds in the sky arranged in symmetrical, repeating patterns without visible distortion or mismatched edges between adjacent cloud shapes?",
    "explanation": "The clouds in Image B are not rendered in the literal sense; rather, they are interpreted through abstract geometry and shapes. Given this stylistic choice, the idea of symmetry and repetition is maintained, with no distortion or mismatched edges. The clouds form part of a cohesive design, leveraging repeated patterns typical of the artistic style applied throughout the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the rocks on the sandy shore appear proportionally consistent with the surrounding terrain, and are they positioned in a way that aligns with the slope and texture of the beach?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rocks are illustrated using abstract angular shapes, characteristic of the overall design style. They are proportionally placed within the visual context of the scene, aligning with the represented lines and angles of the beach. Although simplified, the placement and style reflect an understanding of the terrain, with the geometric forms indicating their consistency with the surrounding sloped textures of the abstract beach representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
