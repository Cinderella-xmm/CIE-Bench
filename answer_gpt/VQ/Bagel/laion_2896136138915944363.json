      "question": "Does the sandpiper's body maintain correct proportions and natural posture, with wings aligned to the torso and legs positioned symmetrically beneath the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandpiper's body appears to maintain correct proportions and a natural posture. The wings are aligned closely with the torso, and the legs are positioned symmetrically beneath the body, which would be expected for a realistic depiction of this bird. The image shows the bird in a standing pose typical for illustrations, indicating a natural alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the packaging surface uniform in pattern and color, with no repeating tiles, sharp edges, or unnatural transitions between areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures on the packaging surface appear uniform, with no visible repeating tiles or sharp edges. The color transitions are smooth and natural between different sections, like the waves and the bird illustration. The design of the packaging uses cohesive colors and patterns that maintain visual harmony across different areas.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"Shoreline Explorer Set\" fully visible, correctly aligned, and rendered with smooth edges without jagged lines or transparency artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Shoreline Explorer Set' is visible on both the front and side of the packaging. However, the text is partially cut off, specifically the 'Explorer' which is misspelled as 'EXOPRRER' on the side of the box. Additionally, the text appears slightly uneven, suggesting misalignment, particularly with visible jaggedness and lack of smooth edges.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the wave patterns on the flat bottom of the packaging form continuous, flowing curves without gaps, overlaps, or angular distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wave patterns at the bottom of the packaging in Image B appear to form continuous and flowing curves. There are no obvious gaps, overlaps, or angular distortions. The patterns and colors are consistent and well-integrated into the design, contributing to the aesthetic appeal of the packaging.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the binocular-shaped cut-out window properly shaped with smooth contours, and does it show a clear, non-distorted view of internal kit components without floating or misplaced objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cut-out window on the packaging is shaped like binoculars, featuring smooth contours. However, it does not show the internal kit components. Instead, it appears to be a cut-out with no visible interior view of the contents, suggesting that the question about the internal view cannot be accurately assessed.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a smooth, continuous transition between the sandpiper illustration and the surrounding packaging elements, with no visible outlines, shadows, or color discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandpiper illustration is well-integrated into the packaging design. There is no visible outline, shadow, or color discontinuity between the bird illustration and the surrounding elements. The transition is smooth, contributing to a cohesive visual presentation.",
