      "question": "Does the keychain with the chibi-style German Shepherd appear naturally integrated into the scene without disrupting the overall realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain featuring a chibi-style German Shepherd is prominently displayed. The keychain design is cartoonish and meant to appear playful and exaggerated rather than realistic. It's seamlessly held by a hand, which suggests a natural integration into the scene as it resembles a typical human interaction with a keychain. Given the whimsical style of the keychain, its integration is considered natural for the scene it depicts, where the emphasis is not strictly on realism.",
