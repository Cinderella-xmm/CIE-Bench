      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure maintain a natural and coherent body structure without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure is depicted with a consistent and uniform body structure typical of chibi characters. This design usually includes larger heads and smaller bodies, which are stylistically simplified. By carefully observing the figure, there seems to be no distortion or interruption in its geometric shapes, as the proportions and transitions between different body parts look coherent and well-integrated.",

      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the chibi-style figure's clothing and accessories natural and free from any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the textures and materials of the figure's clothing and accessories appear smooth and consistent with the chibi aesthetic. The clothing, such as the jacket and backpack, shows no signs of pixelation or texture anomalies that would suggest unnatural artifacts. The simplified rendering of the material fits the chibi style and does not show discrepancies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the large, sparkling eyes and cheerful smile of the chibi-style figure look natural and consistent with its overall design without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the face is blurred, other features like large eyes and a cheerful smile are hallmarks of chibi-style figures, typically characterized by exaggerated and cute features. Without viewing distortion signs, we can reasonably assume these features align with the figure's overall design. Since the style naturally enhances such features, they likely fit the character's profile.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the old-fashioned train and tiny train platform in the background rendered with appropriate detail and texture, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals that the representation of the old-fashioned train and the platform, though miniature in the scene's context, maintains clarity and appropriate detail reflecting a charm associated with historical steam engines. There is no visible evidence of distortions or missing details, which would indicate natural rendering consistent with the chibi theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the soft cream-colored display box with delicate gold embellishments and the engraving \"ADVENTURE AWAITS\" appear structurally sound and visually credible without any distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the display box is presented with a smooth, cream-colored surface, and the gold embellishments look symmetrical and intact, giving a polished and finished appearance. The engraving 'ADVENTURE AWAITS' is legible and well-positioned, suggesting there is no apparent distortion affecting the overall structural integrity of the box.",
