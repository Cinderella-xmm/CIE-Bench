    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and smile drawn on the glass surface without causing visible distortion or blocking of the internal filament structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and smile are drawn on the bulb directly. The cartoon representation does not cause any distortion to the filament structure inside the bulb. This artistic visualization treats the bulb as a character, which is evident and clear without obstructing what's underneath, as seen in the image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the arms extend from the bulb body in a way that follows the curvature of the glass and metal cage without appearing detached or geometrically broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon has arms emerging from the bulb in a stylized manner, which does not coincide with the structure of the original glass bulb or cage shown in Image A. Instead, Image B presents these arms fitting with its character aesthetic, appearing attached but separate from the conventional bulb features. This portrays them as part of a cartoon character, thus they do not follow real-world geometry or curvature related to the lamp's cage structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the metal cage fully intact with all loops connected and symmetrically arranged around the bulb, showing no missing or distorted sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces the concept of an intact metal cage with a cartoon-style structure. Therefore, while it maintains an artistic representation resembling the original lamp design, its presentation does not include a detailed symmetrical arrangement as seen in real lamp structures like in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the background elements cast shadows and reflect light in a manner consistent with the direction and intensity of the bulb’s glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements are cartoon-like features. Shadows and reflections are based more on stylistic rendering than on realistic lighting effects from a bulb. This approach to light and shadow is not consistent with a real bulb like in Image A, since they are adjusted to match the cartoon narrative rather than realistic physics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors applied evenly across all surfaces (glass, metal, background) without visible banding, oversaturation, or texture degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is stylized in a flat cartoon technique, where color tends to be evenly applied across surfaces to maintain visual simplicity and clarity. The image intentionally avoids realistic texture details, banding, or oversaturation to stay consistent with the cartoon art style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the text box and speech bubble positioned so that they do not overlap with the bulb’s internal structure or metal cage, and are they clearly readable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text box and speech bubble are positioned in a cartoon layout which avoids overlap with the structural elements like the bulb's internal filaments or an imagined cage structure. They are specially positioned above the character to maintain clarity, reflecting standard cartoon-style presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the arms positioned in a way that follows natural joint angles and does not intersect with the bulb’s glass or metal cage in an impossible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms of the cartoon bulb character do not follow realistic physics or joint angles, as they are more consistent with stylized animation. They don't intersect with the bulb’s physical or metal cage structure but instead follow an artistic narrative indicating movement or expression typical of animated features, departing from real-world cage constraints as seen in Image A.",
