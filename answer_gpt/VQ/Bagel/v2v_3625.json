      "question": "Are the textures of the ceramic mosaic tiles smooth and consistent without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the map is composed of ceramic mosaic tiles, which typically feature a glossy and smooth texture due to their glazed surfaces. The boundaries between the tiles, however, are visible, creating a mosaic effect where grout lines are apparent. This results in a consistent texture characteristic of mosaics, rather than being completely smooth like a continuous surface. Given this, there are no unnatural artifacts, but rather the expected textural elements of mosaic art.",

      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the map and pins maintain their integrity without distortion in the ceramic mosaic tile artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation of the map into a ceramic mosaic tile artwork introduces segmented patterns and lines indicative of typical mosaic designs. These elements can introduce minor distortions or changes in contour due to tiling; however, the overall shapes of the pins remain recognizable and intact, maintaining their geometric integrity. Though the tiles fragment details, the major forms and positions are preserved.",

      "question": "Are the colors of the ceramic mosaic tiles bold and harmonious, reflecting the original map's visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic tiles exhibit strong, saturated colors which is characteristic of ceramic tiles. The color palette remains aligned with the original map's colors—such as red, blue, and green—albeit in a more stylized, pronounced way, which preserves the essence and harmony of the map's appearance. Therefore, the colors can definitely be considered bold and harmonious in the context of mosaic artistry.",

      "question": "Have the fine details of the map and pins been preserved in the ceramic mosaic tile artwork without significant loss?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the intrinsic nature of mosaic tile artworks, which use small tiles (tesserae), can lead to a loss in fine detail as the image is constructed from larger segments compared to a finely printed map. While the major components like colored pins are recognizable, the fine details typical of a map, like small text and minor topographical lines, would be lost or oversimplified. Therefore, the fine details are not preserved due to the stylistic nature of mosaics.",

      "question": "Does the hand appear natural and undistorted while interacting with the ceramic mosaic tile artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand interacting with the ceramic mosaic tile artwork appears realistic and natural. The hand maintains its natural shape and form without any apparent distortion or unnatural bending, suggesting the editing process preserved the integrity of the hand in its interaction with the artwork.",
