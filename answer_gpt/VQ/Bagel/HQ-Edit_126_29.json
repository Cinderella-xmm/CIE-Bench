      "question": "Does the book animation on the clock face align perfectly with the curved top and vertical frame of the clock, maintaining consistent proportions and smooth transitions between materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock in Image B depicts an animated concept with a book instead of a traditional clock face. The book appears mostly aligned with the curved top and vertical frame, suggesting an artistic blending of designs. However, given that it's an imaginative concept, it might not be perfectly seamless, as the transition between a book's characteristics and a clock frame can be inherently challenging to balance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the text snippets embedded in the wallpaper clearly legible, evenly spaced, and seamlessly blended into the background pattern without creating unnatural shadows or color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text snippets are part of a graphical design and are intended to mimic a historic or artistic style. They seem to be intentionally stylized, and although visually intriguing, they are difficult to read and not clearly legible or evenly spaced compared to modern clarity standards.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the image of the ancient sundial inside the framed artwork properly scaled, centered, and rendered with consistent lighting and depth relative to the original frame and surrounding wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The framed sundial in Image B is presented as a design element and appears to fit within the frame. It is centered and maintains a reasonable scale, but the consistency of lighting and depth rendering is not accurately maintainable visually, especially compared to real physical objects and their shadows or highlights.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the pen-shaped clock hands appear structurally sound, properly aligned with the bookâ€™s cover, and free from distortion such as bent metal parts or mismatched shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock hands in Image B are designed to look like a pen, an innovative twist on traditional clock hands. While they align with the book concept, whether they are structurally sound could be debated, as the representation is fanciful. There don't appear to be significant distortion or mismatched shadows visually noted in this design principle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the captions placed in the room clearly readable, stylistically consistent with art-nouveau design, and physically integrated into their respective surfaces without overlapping or distorting underlying materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The captions in Image B are styled to match an art-nouveau design, which typically emphasizes curvaceous forms and elegant lettering. While they harmonize with the design concept, their readability is compromised, and they do not integrate flawlessly as they often seem to hover over the surface rather than being integral to the design.",
