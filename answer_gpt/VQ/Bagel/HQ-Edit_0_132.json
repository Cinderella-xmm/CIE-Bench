    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the three figures retain anatomically correct body proportions and natural hand shapes (with no more than five fingers per hand) after being stylized as ink-painting poets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are depicted in a traditional ink-painting style which simplifies and exaggerates certain features for stylistic effect. Their body proportions appear elongated, which is common in this art form, and their hands, though stylized, seem to have the correct number of fingers. Ink-painting often compromises strict anatomical accuracy for artistic expression, but within this context, the proportions and hand shapes reflect the typical style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the willow branches and lotus leaves rendered with smooth, flowing brushstrokes that preserve their natural form and do not exhibit jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the willow branches and lotus leaves using classic ink-painting techniques characterized by smooth and continuous brushstrokes. The essence of ink-painting is to capture the fluidity and elegance of nature, which is evident in the seamless and unbroken lines without any jagged edges or artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mountain background feature soft, layered ink-wash gradients that blend naturally with the surrounding mist and sky without sharp transitions or artificial blur effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are rendered with traditional ink wash techniques that focus on creating smooth, atmospheric gradients. These gradients softly transition into the mist and sky, characteristic of the ethereal quality found in ink-wash art, and avoid any harsh lines or artificial blur, maintaining a coherent and natural scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the arm and hand positions of the figures show natural joint alignment and fluid motion, with no bent or missing fingers or unnatural limb extensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arm and hand positions are stylized but maintain a natural flow and grace typical of traditional ink painting. The joints and fingers are presented in realistic alignment with a sense of fluidity, even with the artistic stylization.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the ink-style elements (figures, willows, lotuses, mountains) harmoniously integrated into the scene with consistent lighting, shadow, and depth cues, and do they avoid appearing detached or misplaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B integrates all elements – figures, willows, lotuses, and mountains – using consistent ink-painting techniques that provide coherence in terms of lighting, shadow, and depth. The harmonious style ensures each component appears as part of a unified art piece, rather than detached or out of sync with the rest.",
