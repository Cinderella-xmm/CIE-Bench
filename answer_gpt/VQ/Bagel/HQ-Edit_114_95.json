    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass-like surface of the transformed Eiffel Tower show natural transparency and subtle reflections consistent with real glass under overcast lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower has been transformed to resemble a glass bottle. The surface does exhibit a glass-like quality with some semblance of transparency and reflection typical of glass. The lighting in the image is overcast, which tends to produce subdued reflections consistent with what would be expected on glass under such conditions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the embossed patterns on the glass surface aligned with the original lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower and proportionally consistent across all levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation in Image B has applied a bottle-like structure replacing the original tower's lattice with smooth glass. The embossed look may be present but doesn't mirror the original lattice structure directly. The proportions and alignment do not perfectly reflect the Eiffel Tower's original detailing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold-plated base positioned correctly at the bottom of the tower, with smooth edges and consistent metallic texture that matches the scale and lighting of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bottom part of the transformed Eiffel Tower resembling a bottle with a gold-plated appearance. However, assessing the image, the edges do not appear smooth, and the texture does not convincingly depict a realistic metallic appearance consistent with its positioning and lighting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Parisian skyline motif visible along the glass surface without distorting the towerâ€™s shape or appearing as a floating or disconnected element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is a reflection or motif that resembles a skyline near the lower part of the bottle, the structure of the tower appears distorted due to the transformation into a bottle. It doesn't seem as a coherent part of the structure and instead appears as a superimposed or floating element.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the logo at the neck of the bottle clearly defined, centered, and free from jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the logo at the neck of the bottle is positioned at the top of the bottle structure. The logo seems clear and generally well-defined without noticeable jagged edges or significant texture artifacts, maintaining a centered position.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the main structural elements of the tower (legs, arches, central column) preserved in correct proportion and alignment, with no signs of stretching or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation to a bottle has affected the proportions of the Eiffel Tower. The characteristics such as legs, arches, and central column have been altered significantly, leading to a lack of alignment and proportion consistent with the original structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as pixelation, color bleeding, or unnatural reflections around the transformed tower or its components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no overt signs of artifacts such as pixelation or color bleeding that stand out. The reflections and overall execution seem reasonably clean with no glaring unnatural effects.",
