      "question": "Do the hands and arms of both individuals maintain natural proportions and shapes without appearing distorted or having unnatural numbers of fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands and arms of both characters are drawn in a stylized anime manner. Despite the artistic style, the proportions and anatomy of the hands and arms appear correct, and both figures have the appropriate number of fingers. The process involves evaluating the visual representation based on typical anime proportions, where a natural depiction involves correct anatomy within the style norms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the characters' clothes and the grass field preserved naturally without losing detail or creating unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters' clothes are depicted in a smooth and clean anime style, consistent with common design patterns where detail levels are simplified. The grass field is rendered with a stylized anime approach, which tends to prioritize smooth color transitions over detailed textures. The analysis process involves distinguishing between the realistic texture expectations and the anime conventions, resulting in a yes as the simplified detail aligns with the intentions of anime art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the lighting in the edited image accurately reflect the original sunlight direction, maintaining shadow and highlight placements in a natural manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents bright lighting consistent with a clear sky environment typical in anime art. The shadows under the characters align with expected light behavior given the assumed overhead sunlight direction, mimicking realistic shadow placement. Evaluating the sunlight direction means comparing the shadows' position and intensity with common daylight shadow effects, and identifying natural placements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the positioning and trajectory of the frisbee in mid-air consistent with realistic motion, avoiding any apparent physical inaccuracies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frisbee is suspended in mid-air between the two characters in a position suggesting it is being exchanged. The trajectory appears reasonable within the context of their game. The analysis involves assessing the frisbee’s position relative to the characters' actions to confirm its natural placement and trajectory during motion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the facial expressions and body postures of the characters align naturally with their dynamic poses and the context of playing frisbee, without any exaggerated or inconsistent distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without evaluating facial expressions, the characters’ postures in Image B reflect dynamic, engaging positions likely to occur during frisbee playing. Their body positioning supports their arms extended towards the frisbee, adhering closely to a realistic depiction of their activity. The analysis involves cross-referencing typical dynamics involved in frisbee games and confirms natural body articulation.",
