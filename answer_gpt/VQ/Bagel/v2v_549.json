      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style Funko Pop figure maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the baseball player's pose and attire without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure follows the design style of such collectibles, typically characterized by exaggerated head sizes and simplified features. This chibi aesthetic intentionally distorts proportions away from realistic references. However, within the Funko Pop product style, the figure maintains internal consistency in pose and attire, typical for such figures. No unnatural distortions outside of the stylistic choices expected of the chibi style are evident.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the detailed textures and lighting of the realistic depiction of the figure outside the box natural and consistent with the lighting and textures in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop figure in Image B is designed to have a playful, cartoonish texture typical of vinyl toys, which naturally differ from realistic textures. Image A, showing a live-action baseball scene, is naturally more detailed in textures and lighting. The chibi figure does not aim to match those realistic traits but remains consistent with what is typically expected of Funko Pop styling.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there an absence of unnatural textures or loss of fine details where the chibi-style figure transitions to the realistic depiction of the figure outside the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure outside the box maintains the same chibi style with uniform textures, avoiding any unnatural transitions or lapses in detail compared to the Funko Pop box image. The depiction remains consistent with its cartoon-like vinyl texture, typical for a Pop figure. Hence, no additional unnatural textures or loss of details are observed at the transition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the Funko Pop-style box and its elements (ball, glove, title) integrate naturally with the overall scene without disrupting the visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop-style box in Image B serves as the product packaging typical for such figuresâ€”a design unrelated to Image A's context of a live-action scene. Within its own stylized context, the box maintains credibility. The box's design appropriately follows Funko Pop aesthetics, which intentionally divert from realistic elements. Therefore, seen independently, these elements integrate naturally within the intended style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the isometric view of the Funko Pop-style box preserve the structural integrity and avoid any broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the isometric view of the Funko Pop-style box maintains a consistent geometric shape without any breaks, providing a typical box structure often seen in toy and collectible packaging. The angles and structure are clearly defined, with no evident disruptions in geometry, aligning with common packaging design practices.",
