      "question": "Do the petal-like feathers on the sparrow’s body exhibit smooth transitions in pink gradient without visible pixelation, banding, or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feathers resemble petals with a smooth gradient transitioning from a lighter pink to a more saturated hue, showing no pixelation or abrupt color shifts. This indicates the use of a refined gradient tool or technique. World knowledge about digital art suggests that smooth gradient transitions are characteristic of high-quality rendering, contributing to a visually appealing appearance without interruptions in color flow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blossom patterns on the wings aligned with the natural feather structure and do they avoid overlapping or warping of existing feather edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts blossom patterns as part of the bird's wing design. The blossoms are aligned and integrated seamlessly with the feathers, without any distortion or overlap over feather lines. In digital graphics, aligning patterns with underlying structures suggests meticulous editing skill to enhance realism and maintain structural integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cascading cherry blossom tail emerge naturally from the base of the original tail and follow a downward flow that matches the bird’s posture without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail is artistically transformed into a cascade of cherry blossoms, maintaining a natural attachment at the base. It aligns with the bird's positioning and gravity, creating a cohesive flow that complements the bird's posture. This demonstrates an understanding of how objects should interact and align within a naturalistic digital artwork environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the vines around the sparrow’s legs follow natural curvature and thickness proportional to the leg size, without penetrating or distorting the foot structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vines in Image B are illustrated around the sparrow’s legs with a natural curvature, closely following the leg contours and maintaining proportionality. They do not appear to penetrate or distort the leg, suggesting careful attention to anatomical accuracy and digital manipulation, avoiding any unrealistic portrayal that would detract from the overall realism of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dewdrop ornaments on the chest positioned realistically on the surface of the feathers and do they reflect light consistently with surrounding lighting conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dewdrop ornaments in Image B seem to be strategically placed on the bird's chest, positioned in a way that naturally adheres to the surface of the feathers. They exhibit light reflection consistent with the ambient lighting evident in the rest of the image, indicating attention to realistic rendering techniques that enhance the perceived depth and natural interaction of light and surface.",
