      "question": "Do the vibrant striped and polka dot patterns on the 3D chibi-style ties appear undistorted and maintain their original integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties have a 3D chibi-style rendering which gives them a smoother and more exaggerated appearance compared to normal ties. The striped tie displays vibrant colors without distortion, maintaining a consistent pattern with equal width for all stripes. Similarly, the polka dot tie maintains evenly spaced dots that are not stretched or altered. These visual cues suggest that the patterns retain their original integrity in this edited style.",

      "question": "Are the 3D chibi-style ties seamlessly integrated into the realistic drawer setting without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties appear cartoonish and stand out against the more realistically rendered drawer, due to their smoother material properties and exaggerated color presentation. This difference in style and texture between the ties and drawer introduces a juxtaposition that is visually noticeable. The ties do not blend seamlessly, as their texture lacks the depth and grain expected in a realistic setting.",

      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style ties retain proper proportions and physical rationality, ensuring no geometric shapes are broken or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D chibi-style ties in Image B are rendered with clear geometric shapes that are undistorted. They maintain the expected proportions for neckties, having straight edges and pointed tips without any signs of breakage or irregular form. This adherence to geometric integrity ensures that the proportions appear rational and consistent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style ties exhibit consistent material properties, such as texture and sheen, similar to their original appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties exhibit a simplified, soft-edged appearance indicative of 3D chibi-style renderings. This style often features reduced texture complexity and a more uniform sheen, unlike the nuanced texture and sheen in Image A's realistic depiction. The edited image's material properties differ from the realism of the original, displaying a stylized, cartoon-like surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the arrangement of the 3D chibi-style ties within the drawer setting adhere to common sense and physical logic, ensuring visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement in Image B shows the ties laid parallel and side by side within the drawer. This configuration is logical and typical for storing ties, adhering to physical expectations. Despite the chibi-style rendering, the spatial placement is realistic and suggests that the objects are intended to fit within the drawer setting properly.",
