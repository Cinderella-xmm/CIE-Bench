    "Question": "Q1: Do the enlarged shopping bags retain their original geometric shapes without distorted edges or broken polygons?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shopping bags appear with vibrant and exaggerated geometric shapes reflecting abstract design elements. These shapes do not maintain the realism and proportionality found in Image A, as they are stylized with exaggerated colors and forms. Thus, the original geometric integrity of the bags is not preserved in Image B, showcasing broken polygons and distorted edges.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the glossy gloves visually consistent in shape and reflection, with no distorted finger joints or misplaced highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gloves have been abstracted into a more graphic representation, which lacks the finer detailing of reflections and contours that characterize glossy materials seen in Image A. The highlights and gloss appear as solid colors without appropriate reflection variations or detailed finger joints, resulting in a lack of visual consistency.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the open panel for personal messages blend seamlessly into the background with matching lighting and texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the open panel for personal messages resembles an abstract design and stands out against the colorful background rather than blending seamlessly. It contrasts with the creative setting, not integrating smoothly due to stylistic deviations in lighting and texture.",
