      "question": "Does the truck maintain its original proportions and structural integrity without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is illustrated in a stylized or simplified manner, leading to potential deviations from real-world proportions. The shapes are bold and the outlines are exaggerated, but this is consistent with a cartoonish art style rather than an indication of distortion. The truck's proportions appear consistent within this context, maintaining geometric coherence typical of simplified or abstracted illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces and textures of the truck, such as the wheels, cab, and grille, free from unnatural artifacts and retain appropriate levels of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a highly stylized, simplified art style where textures and surface details are deliberately minimal or abstracted. The design avoids the depiction of intricate details, resembling more of a flat color approach without degradation or unwanted artifacts. Therefore, within the stylistic intents of cartoonish representation, the surfaces are appropriately clean from artifacts.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cab's vibrant colors appear natural against the truck's materials and lighting conditions, ensuring material consistency and avoiding unrealistic contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette is vividly flat and simplified, consistent with a cartoon or children's book style, where vibrant tones are common. The colors are intended to stand out, creating contrast typical for this art form. Given this context, the consistency is maintained within that scope, as vibrant colors complement the artistic style rather than replicate realistic lighting and material cues.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the simplified background naturally integrated with the truck, maintaining the overall authenticity of the scene without introducing distracting or out-of-place elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is reduced to basic shapes and flat colors, consistent with the overall visual theme of simplification. This aligns with common visual techniques for abstract or minimalistic designs, where elements are intentionally stylized to harmonize without detail causing distractions. The integration is consistent stylistically with the truck, contributing to an authentic scene within a simplified artistic context.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wheels maintain their structural and physical logic, with no signs of distortion or misalignment, thereby preserving the truck's visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the absence of realistic detail, the wheels are depicted as even and symmetrical with respect to the truck's frame, which is expected in stylized illustrations. They maintain their round shape and appropriate placement, ensuring functional integrity and consistency according to the rules of abstract representation. There is no visible distortion undermining their structure or alignment.",
