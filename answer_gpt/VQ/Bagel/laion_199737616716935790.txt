    "Question": "Q1: Are the black and blue brick textures on the motorcycle body panels uniformly aligned and geometrically consistent with the original angular design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is constructed from LEGO bricks that inherently have a blocky and angular appearance. The blue and black bricks on the motorcycle body exhibit a consistent alignment and fit well within the angular nature expected from LEGO constructions. This coherence in geometric consistency and uniformity of texture is typical for brick-based designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the cog-patterned rims maintain circular shape and evenly spaced teeth that match the wheel diameter and do not appear stretched or broken?",
    "explanation": "The wheel in Image B is crafted using LEGO technique parts where the cog-patterned rims are intentionally designed for a circular shape. These rims show evenly spaced 'teeth' which accommodate the wheel diameter without visible deformation. LEGO parts are constructed to maintain structural integrity and shape, thereby retaining the intended circular form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the colorful decals seamlessly embedded into the brick surface, showing no visible gaps, overlaps, or unnatural layering effects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO motorcycle does not exhibit any applied decals or stickers; instead, the colors and patterns are inherent to the individual LEGO bricks themselves. The absence of decals means there's no risk of gaps, overlaps, or layering issues. This is characteristic of LEGO builds, where color variation is achieved through individual brick colors rather than surface-decaled designs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the gray baseplate flat, continuous, and properly supporting the motorcycleâ€™s wheels without any visible elevation mismatch or distortion?",
    "explanation": "The motorcycle in Image B is placed upon a gray LEGO baseplate, which appears flat and continuous. The baseplate is notably level and provides adequate support for the motorcycle's wheels. LEGO baseplates are designed to be structurally sound and even, ensuring no visible deformation, mismatched elevation, or distortion that can compromise the stability or support.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the display case have clear, undistorted boundaries with no ghosting, refraction errors, or unintended shadows affecting the motorcycle's appearance?",
    "explanation": "The display case in Image B surrounds the motorcycle in a protective, transparent enclosure. The boundaries of the case appear clear with sharp edges, free from ghosting or refraction errors that might typically distort the visibility. The lighting and shadows are consistent, with no unintended effects causing visual disturbances to the motorcycle's appearance. This indicates a well-designed display with optical clarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
