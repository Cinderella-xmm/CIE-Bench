      "question": "Are the handwritten notes and highlighted dates on the calendar pages clear and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar shows a handwritten note and a highlighted date. The handwritten note 'Wedding' is written clearly and is easily legible, without appearing distorted or warped. The date 12 is circled in blue, and the highlight is distinct and consistent in color. This clarity suggests no distortion is present in the way they are shown.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the textures of the paper and desk appear natural and consistent with the lighting and shadows in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The paper in Image B appears to have a realistic thickness and the way it is stacked shows natural edges and shadows. The desk has a wood-like texture, and the lighting and shadows seem consistent and natural, providing a sense of depth and realism to the materials shown.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the calendar pages arranged neatly without any unnatural breaks or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar page is slightly tilted, resting atop a stack. This appears natural as the pages follow an uneven yet realistic stack formation typical of physical paper sheets stacked. There are no obvious breaks or misaligned pages that would suggest digital manipulation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the text and grid lines on the calendar pages sharp and well-defined without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text and grid lines in Image B are clearly visible and exhibit well-defined edges. The numbers, letters, and grid lines do not display blurriness or loss of sharpness, maintaining clarity throughout the visible areas of the calendar.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the handwritten notes and highlights consistent and natural, without any unnatural color variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handwritten note 'Wedding' is in red and circled date is in blue, both of which appear consistent with what one would expect from markers or pens. The colors are solid and do not show unnatural fades or peculiar variations, maintaining a uniform appearance.",
