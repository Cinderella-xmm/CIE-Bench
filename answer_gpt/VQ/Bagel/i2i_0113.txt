    "Question": "Q1: Does the character's face maintain its natural appearance and texture while integrated into the soft vinyl material without visible unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character's face is softened in a manner consistent with vinyl figures, which typically have smooth surfaces lacking intricate facial detail. The integration of the face into vinyl material likely results in a simplified texture to match the medium, which is characteristic of vinyl figures, hence 'natural' for this medium. This assessment does not identify any unnatural artifacts present.",
