    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the brass gears and leather armor pieces on the character’s torso and limbs have consistent shapes, realistic metallic textures, and proper alignment without visible gaps or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass gears are depicted with realistic metallic textures, including appropriate reflections and shadows, which suggest a high level of detail. The leather armor pieces complement the metallic textures and appear to be well-integrated in terms of alignment and design, as no gaps or misaligned edges are visibly present. World knowledge about the consistency and alignment of gears in mechanical designs supports this interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the clockwork wings symmetrically positioned and structurally coherent, with visible mechanical joints and gear patterns that follow logical engineering principles and do not exhibit warped or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows wings that are symmetrically positioned on either side of the character, with coherent structural designs. The gear patterns follow logical engineering principles and avoid warped or broken geometry. This conclusion is drawn by examining the symmetrical arrangement and consistent pattern of mechanical elements, which adhere to common mechanical design principles and visual aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the clock face integrated into the glowing orb clearly visible, properly scaled, and emitting light consistently with the surrounding glow, without distorting the shape or texture of the orb or tendrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a clock face integrated into a glowing orb as described. The visual elements are a combination of gears and a central clock, without an orb-like feature. Therefore, based on the presented design and arrangement, it appears there isn't compatibility with the question's description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background cityscape feature detailed brass towers and airships arranged in a spatially plausible layout, with consistent lighting and shadowing under a sepia tone, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cityscape is detailed with brass towers and airships that are arranged logically within the scene. The sepia tone is applied consistently, and there are no visibly floating or disconnected elements. The arrangement of towers and airships fits within common perceptions of a steampunk cityscape and uses appropriate lighting and shadowing that support spatial plausibility.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sepia tone applied consistently across the entire image, maintaining visible details in the character’s clothing, mechanical elements, and background without causing fading, discoloration, or loss of contrast in critical areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sepia tone is applied consistently across the entire image. The details in the character’s clothing, mechanical elements, and background are preserved with sufficient contrast, avoiding fading or discoloration. This analysis is based on visual inspection of the consistent application of color tone and the retention of contrast necessary to highlight specific details effectively.",
