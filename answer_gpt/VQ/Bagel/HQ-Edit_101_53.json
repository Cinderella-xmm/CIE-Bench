    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the wood grain on the pug's body appear continuous and natural, with no repeating patterns or unnatural stretching, especially along the spine and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the wood grain on the pug's body is neatly aligned and appears to follow a natural, unique path indicative of a real grain pattern. There are no noticeable repeating patterns or unnatural stretching along the spine and limbs, which would suggest an artificial appearance. Wood grain typically exhibits variability and a lack of repetition, characteristics observed here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and creases on the pug’s face rendered as smooth, shallow grooves consistent with carved wood, without sharp, broken, or overly deep lines that disrupt the natural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial wrinkles and creases of the pug are designed as smooth and shallow grooves. They don't exhibit sharp or overly deep lines that would disrupt the cohesive appearance of carved wood. This suggests a deliberate design consistent with carving techniques used to maintain natural aesthetics in wooden sculptures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the pug’s limbs, head, and torso retain their original proportions and anatomical alignment, with no visible elongation, compression, or misshapen joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B, the pug’s limbs, head, and torso seem well-proportioned and anatomically aligned, reflecting the typical compact nature of a pug. There is no visible elongation, compression, or awkward positioning of joints, indicating a careful and accurate representation in the carving process.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the transitions between different parts of the wooden pug (e.g., head to neck, ear to head) seamless, with no visible cracks, ghosting, or color discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, transitions between various parts of the wooden pug sculpture, such as the head to neck and ear to head, appear seamless. There are no apparent cracks, ghosting, or color discontinuities. This seamless integration reflects skilled craftsmanship consistent with high-quality wood carving.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the black base beneath the pug flat, uniformly dark, and fully supporting the pug’s feet without any gaps, shadows suggesting suspension, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the black base under the wooden pug appears flat, with a uniform dark color. The base fully supports the pug's feet without any visible gaps or shadows that would imply suspension or misalignment, ensuring the sculpture's stability and realism.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the highlights and shadows on the wooden pug match the ambient lighting of the scene, with reflections and depth appropriate for polished wood rather than fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, highlights and shadows on the wooden pug align with the ambient lighting. They show reflections and a depth that is congruent with polished wood, discernible through the shiny and smooth texture. This depiction is consistent with a wooden material rather than attempting to replicate the texture of fur.",
