    "Question": "Q1: Does the translucent green LEGO brick construction of the bottle’s body maintain a consistent cylindrical form without visible warping or misalignment between bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is built from LEGO bricks and appears in a green hue. The structure is not cylindrical as one would expect from a bottle made from bricks; rather, it seems square or rectangular, typical of LEGO constructions. A cylindrical form is challenging to achieve with LEGO bricks without some visible alignment issues. Given the nature of LEGOs, the form deviates from typical cylindrical bottles seen in glass or other continuous materials, suggesting warping or misalignment when compared to a smooth cylindrical surface.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are all brand text elements (e.g., 'BACARDÍ', 'MOJITO') and logos clearly identifiable and properly aligned on the LEGO label, without distorted letterforms or missing characters?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the text 'BACARDÍ' and 'MOJITO' displayed on a LEGO label. The word 'BACARDÍ' seems properly aligned and identifiable, and the word 'MOJITO' appears similarly recognizable. However, the intricacies possible in print are harder to replicate exactly on LEGO bricks. Despite this constraint, the text elements and logos on Image B are clear and appear to be correctly structured without distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the blue LEGO cap accurately shaped as a cylinder with consistent height and diameter matching the original bottle’s neck, and does it feature a smooth, rounded top without angular breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cap is built using blue LEGO bricks. LEGOs have a blocky nature, hence the cap has angular visual conditions and is not truly cylindrical with a rounded top, as might be seen in glass/plastic caps. The typical LEGO connection details like dots can be visible on the top, which detracts from a smooth cylindrical appearance and indicates angular breaks, thus not matching seamlessly with the original bottle's neck.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the white shelf beneath the LEGO bottle flat, horizontally aligned, and free from irregular edges or floating segments that suggest poor integration with the scene?",
    "explanation": "The shelf beneath the LEGO bottle in Image B appears straight, flat, and horizontally aligned. Its structure shows no signs of irregular edges or segments that appear disjointed or floating, suggesting good integration into the scene without visible flaws or poor craftsmanship.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the smaller text elements such as 'natural mint flavor' and 'Simply pour over ice' fully visible and correctly spaced on the LEGO label, without overlapping or broken lettering?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the smaller text elements present on the original label are not visible. LEGO's modular formations and larger block style make recreating fine detail challenging, leading to omitted elements and inability to show smaller text effectively without distortion or misalignment, contrasting with printed labels.",
    "answer": "No"
