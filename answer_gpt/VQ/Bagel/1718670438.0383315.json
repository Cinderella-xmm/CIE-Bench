      "question": "Does the glass bell jar surrounding the robot have clear, smooth surfaces with natural reflections and refractions that do not distort the robot’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass bell jar surrounding the robot appears to have a clear and smooth surface. The reflections on the jar's surface are natural, showing typical characteristics of glass, such as reflections from the light source. The robot's structure is visible without distortion, suggesting a high-quality refraction that doesn't alter the perceived shape or proportions of the object inside.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the pedestal under the robot properly aligned, proportionally sized, and made of materials consistent with the steampunk theme (e.g., brass, copper) without visible seams or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pedestal under the robot is visibly aligned and proportionally sized to comfortably support the robot, maintaining a balance that is consistent with display items. The pedestal appears to be made of copper or brass, materials typical of the steampunk aesthetic. There are no visible seams or deformations, providing a cohesive and polished appearance that aligns with the decorative theme.",

      "question": "Are the miniature clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils positioned at a plausible scale and orientation around the robot, with natural textures and no floating or disconnected parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils are arranged around the robot at a scale that is consistent with the size of the robot itself. The orientation appears intentional and well-integrated, without any parts seeming to float or appear disconnected from the scene. Their textures are consistent with copper and metallic finishes seen in steampunk designs.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing orbs situated around the robot indeed emit a soft, localized glow. This glow complements the ambient lighting of the overall scene, and no overexposed areas or unnatural light artifacts are evident. The glow adds a subtle, warm ambiance that enhances the steampunk aesthetic without overpowering the surrounding visuals.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The etched patterns on the base of the glass jar in Image B are precise and articulate, reflecting a detailed and coherent design typical of the steampunk style. The lines are sharp, and there is a clear attention to detail, avoiding any blurring or irregularities that would detract from the stylistic theme. The overall look maintains the intricate and mechanical nature expected in steampunk art.",
