      "question": "Do the carrots and soil maintain their texture and detail, appearing natural against the Arctic background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots retain their vivid orange color and the soil maintains a rich brown texture, suggesting they have kept their natural appearance. The image's lighting and focus on both the carrots and the soil are consistent with realistic depictions. However, the contrast with the unexpected Arctic background may challenge the sense of naturalness but does not affect the individual textures of these elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any visible artificial or unnatural textures where the Arctic background meets the soil and carrots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Arctic background in Image B introduces a stark contrast to the natural look of the soil and carrots, potentially leading to a jarring visual transition. Upon examining the junction between the snow, ice, soil, and vegetables, there are areas that might appear unnatural due to the abrupt change from earthy tones to icy blues, suggesting some artificial elements in the transition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the carrots retain their proper size and shape relative to the snowy landscape in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots maintain their size and shape, appearing clearly defined and proportionate as they emerge from the soil. The background's scale with the snow and icebergs does not obscure or dwarf the carrots unnaturally. This implies the carrots remain properly sized relative to their environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the transition between the soil surrounding the carrots and the Arctic background appear seamless and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition between the soil and the Arctic environment in Image B shows a noticeable distinction, which indicates the editing process. The differing textures and colors of the soil and the cold background show a clear boundary, which suggests a lack of seamless merging and hints at distortion or editing artifacts where they meet.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the snow and icebergs in the background crisp and free of degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow and icebergs depicted in Image B appear clear and well-defined, suggesting that the fine details are preserved. The sharpness of these elements indicates that there is no visible degradation affecting the quality of the icy background.",
