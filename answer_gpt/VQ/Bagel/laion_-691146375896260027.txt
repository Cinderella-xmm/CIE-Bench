    "Question": "Q1: Are the brown LEGO bricks covering the dresser body evenly spaced and aligned, with no visible gaps or irregularities in the surface texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO construction is evident with visible studs and the inherent texture of LEGO bricks. The bricks do not appear to be evenly spaced or aligned as there are noticeable gaps and irregularities in the surface texture due to the nature of LEGO pieces, which often results in a blocky appearance and visible seams. Thus, the alignment and spacing cannot be completely even and without gaps.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the herringbone marquetry pattern on the front panels clearly defined and continuous, without broken lines or missing segments caused by improper LEGO piece placement?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, the herringbone pattern seen in Image A is lost due to the LEGO construction. LEGO bricks are not capable of replicating intricate patterns like herringbone with continuity and definition due to their blocky and segmented nature. The pattern is not clear or continuous, and there are no marquetry lines present at all.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the gold decorative borders follow the original curved contours smoothly, without sharp angles or breaks in the flow of the design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO construction results in an overall blocky structure with pieces that exhibit sharp angles and breaks inherently due to their shape. LEGO pieces do not allow for smooth curves or continuous flowing lines like the gold decorative borders. Therefore, the original smooth contours cannot be achieved in the LEGO replica.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the curved side panels and cabriole legs constructed with smoothly joined sloped bricks, showing no visible steps or angular breaks in the profile?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the side panels and cabriole legs consist of multiple LEGO pieces joined together. While some slopes may exist, the overall appearance is blocky with visible steps and angular breaks common with LEGO assemblies. The blocky nature of LEGO restricts the smooth representation of curved and detailed profiles.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the gray LEGO tile top sit flat and level on the dresser, with clean edges and no visible gaps or misalignments where it meets the sides?",
    "explanation": "The gray LEGO tiles on top of Image B seem to sit relatively flat and level, given the precision of LEGO bricks. However, due to the nature of LEGO construction, there are likely to be minor gaps or misalignments visible where the tiles meet other pieces. Yet, the top itself appears, through LEGO standards, to sit as flat as LEGO allows.",
    "answer": "Yes"
