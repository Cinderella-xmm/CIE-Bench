      "question": "Does the LEGO representation of the dog maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO representation of the dog is designed to mimic a real dog in a simplified, block-like style characteristic of LEGO structures. The structure appears coherent and believable as a toy model, with no visible misshapen parts or assembly errors that could destroy its visual consistency. The ears, legs, and body align well with common LEGO constructs, which supports credibility.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gradient shading used for the sky and clouds preserve their natural appearance and depth without introducing any unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO diorama within a glass case, where the sky and clouds serve as the backdrop. The gradient shading of the sky from blue to light near the clouds is smooth and natural. There are no artifacts or disruptions in the transition of colors that would detract from the perceived depth and realism of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the LEGO-style stop sign retain its proper proportions and physical rationality, avoiding any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stop sign is depicted as part of a LEGO diorama. The octagonal shape of the stop sign has been maintained properly, as expected from a LEGO assembly, with no distortions or gaps between blocks that would suggest incomplete construction. The proportion relative to the LEGO dog and its environment matches the expected scale for such a model.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the base and nameplate free of unnatural textures and artifacts, maintaining a natural appearance and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base and nameplate shown at the bottom of the diorama in Image B are consistent with a LEGO construction or a typical display stand. The nameplate has a clean text display and the textures are smooth, without unusual patterns or artifacts that could detract from its professional appearance. Thus, it maintains the required natural appearance and credibility.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the transparent glass cube enclosure preserve its authenticity and natural appearance, without introducing any visual distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass cube enclosure in Image B forms a protective casing around the diorama. The transparency of the cube is well-executed, giving a clear view of the contents without visual distortions or artifacts that might typically be seen due to reflections or refractions. The corners and edges of the glass are consistently defined, maintaining an authentic glass look.",
