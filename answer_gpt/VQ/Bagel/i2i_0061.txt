    "Question": "Q1: Does the watercolor effect applied across the image retain the structural coherence of the skater's pose and the ramp's form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor effect has softened the image, but the essential posture of the skater and the form of the ramp are still recognizable. The body positions, angles, and outlines of both the skater and ramp retain their overall shape, consistent with identifying the main action and scene. Therefore, the structural coherence is preserved despite the stylistic transformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the semi-abstract brushstrokes and blurred colors used for the ground and background buildings free from unnatural textures and artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B utilizes a watercolor technique that inherently involves blending and blurring, which has been applied consistently to create a semi-abstract look for the ground and distant buildings. The outcome is smooth and homogenous without any jarring or out-of-place textures, implying that the transformation is free from unnatural artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Has the skater’s body and clothing retained their proportions and physical rationality after applying the watercolor style?",
    "explanation": "The watercolor effect may soften demarcations but in Image B, the proportions of the skater's body and clothing appear reasonably consistent with real-life expectations. The limbs, torso, and clothing maintain their sizes relative to each other, allowing for a visually rational representation even after stylistic change.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the details on the skater's gray t-shirt and black shoes remain discernible after the watercolor treatment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor effect makes intricate details less distinct, resulting in reduced clarity of textures or fine details on the clothing, such as the t-shirt and shoes, as compared to Image A. Color distinctions remain, though details like designs on the shirt or laces on the shoes are blurred into broader brushstrokes.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the shapes and lines of the skater’s hands remained ergonomic and natural under the watercolor transformation?",
    "explanation": "Despite the transformation to a watercolor style in Image B, the hands of the skater remain identifiable with preserved ergonomic shapes and positions. The portrayal, although stylized, maintains the natural posture expected in skateboarding movements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
