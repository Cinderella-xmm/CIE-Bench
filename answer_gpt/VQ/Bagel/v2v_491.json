      "question": "Does the bear maintain precise proportions and intricate fur details in its anime-inspired form without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stylized bear figure with anime-inspired characteristics. The bear in Image B does not maintain precise proportions of a realistic bear, as seen in Image A; instead, it has simplified and exaggerated features, such as larger eyes and a smoother texture with no detailed fur. This indicates a deliberate artistic choice rather than precise anatomical detail, suggesting natural distortion fitting the anime style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the bear's fur natural and free of any obvious artifacts in the anime-inspired figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear's texture is smooth and plastic-like, common in anime figures, lacking the intricate fur details seen in Image A. This smooth texture is typical for toy-like figures, not resembling natural bear fur, which is usually more detailed and rough. Therefore, the bear's textures in Image B are artificial and do not mimic natural fur.",

      "question": "Is the backpack realistically scaled down and positioned next to the bear on the desk, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack is positioned correctly next to the anime bear figure, indicating proportional scaling relative to the figure. While Image A shows a realistic bear and backpack size and placement in a natural setting, the anime-like design in Image B suggests a stylized depiction of scale. Given the context of Image B, the backpack's scaled position alongside the bear without issues of structural inconsistency aligns with the artistic scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bear's emotive eyes retain their fine details and appear natural without any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear's eyes are prominently stylized with large, exaggerated features typical in anime-inspired designs, which differ significantly from the natural detail in Image A. While they lack the fine details seen in a realistic depiction, they effectively capture the intended emotive and stylized aesthetic without appearing unnatural in context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and lighting of the scene, including the bear and the backpack, convey a casual, natural vibe similar to a smartphone capture without any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses artificial lighting and a polished finish typical of anime figures, creating a deliberate stylized setting rather than appearing natural like Image A, which captures an outdoor, casual look. Although the scene includes realistic elements like a backpack, the setting and composition are intentionally fabricated to fit an indoor, anime-like display rather than a casual snapshot.",
