      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the tessellated tiles forming the sausages maintain the original elongated, curved shape without geometric distortion or unnatural straightening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tessellated tiles that represent the sausages are arranged to mimic the elongated shape seen in Image A. The visual cues suggest that the tiles are closely fitted to maintain the curve without appearing straightened or distorted. World knowledge about tiling and tessellation reveals that this technique can preserve shapes with careful arrangement of tiles, and in this case, Image B retains the curved nature of sausages as represented in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the green-tiled areas shaped to mimic the natural ruffled edges and layered structure of lettuce leaves, with no uniform or blocky alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tessellated tiles for the lettuce retain a ruffled and layered appearance as each tile is irregularly shaped, which reflects the texture of lettuce seen in Image A. The use of non-uniform tiles can be visually observed in the placement and shapes, suggesting a careful alignment to mimic natural lettuce patterns. World knowledge supports that irregular shapes help represent organic forms like lettuce and avoid blocky uniformity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the egg-shaped tile formation perfectly circular with a centrally placed orange-yellow yolk section, matching the original egg’s proportions and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiling effect creates a less perfect circular formation for the egg compared to Image A. The yolk is positioned centrally but appears to deviate slightly from the proportions and orientation seen in the original image. World knowledge about mosaic art suggests that tiles often create irregularities due to the nature of the medium, impacting the ability to form perfect shapes.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mosaic elements positioned symmetrically around the plate’s center, with equal spacing and proportional sizing between the sausage, salad, and egg sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the mosaic elements arranged with an eye to aesthetic balance rather than perfect symmetry. The sausages, salad, and egg appear proportionally spaced but not with perfectly equal spacing or sizing. This reflects a common approach in mosaic art where artistic interpretation guides the layout rather than strict symmetry as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all glass tiles exhibit uniform edge definition, subtle reflection effects, and consistent color shading without visible artifacts like blurring or jagged lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass tiles in Image B demonstrate a clear definition with consistent edge quality, reflection effects, and color shading typical of tessellated artwork. The lack of blurring or jagged lines indicates a high-quality mosaic representation. World knowledge about glass mosaics suggests this uniformity is achievable and expected, reflecting a well-executed artistic effect distinct from Image A.",
