    "Question": "Q1: Does the enlarged head appear natural and maintain structural coherence without distortion or unnatural stretching?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the head appears larger than typical proportions for a human figure, which is a characteristic often seen in stylized cartoon or bobblehead designs. Such a disproportionate head-to-body ratio is intentional in these designs, preserving structural coherence. However, the question seeks whether it appears natural within that specific style. The head's size complements the body in Image B, maintaining a consistent bobblehead aesthetic without visible distortions or unnatural stretching.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the cartoonified body free of obvious artifacts and maintains a certain sense of realism?",
    "explanation": "The body in Image B has been transformed into a simplified, cartoonish form. This design approach typically involves smooth lines and simplified contours, which is evident in the image. The representation steers away from realism, but this is purposeful to align with a caricature style. The body does not display any artifacts or irregularities that would detract from this aesthetic, offering a coherent cartoon style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the positioning of the bobblehead on the bookshelf look visually plausible and structurally consistent with the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bobblehead figurine is placed on a bookshelf with an arrangement of books and a trophy in the background. The positioning of the bobblehead on the shelf appears visually plausible and is consistent with typical placement on such objects. The perspective and proportions align well with the background elements, indicating attention to maintaining structural consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the face retained its accuracy with no loss of fine details or introduction of unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "The question cannot be evaluated properly as the face is blurred in both images, which prevents an assessment of its accuracy, retention of details, or presence of unnatural textures.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the combination of an accurate face and a cartoonified body achieve coherence and natural appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the body is intentionally cartoonified, which means it has exaggerated proportions typical for a figurine or bobblehead toy. Without assessing the face, the combination of these elements between the body and any hypothetical facial detail assumes a stylistic coherence found in toy design. The blurred face prevents a full evaluation of coherence with the body, but the body achieves its intended cartoonish appearance naturally.",
    "answer": "Yes"
