      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style figure appear to seamlessly emerge from the kayak without any visible breaks or unnatural intersections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure is positioned inside the kayak, with the edges of the kayak surrounding it smoothly. The integration seems natural as there are no apparent breaks or misalignments where the figure meets the kayak. The smooth transition and coherent placement suggest that the figure has been expertly merged with the kayak without any visual anomalies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or artifacts present around the edges where the chibi figure meets the kayak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the connection between the chibi figure and the kayak doesn't reveal any peculiar textures or artifacts. The lighting and shadow effects around the edges appear consistent with the figure being part of the kayak setup. The seamless interaction indicates a well-rendered integration without extra artifacts.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the chibi figure relative to the kayak appear realistic and maintain structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figure in Image B is small, fitting within the cockpit of the kayak proportionately. Compared to how a human would fill a kayak, the size of the chibi figure seems exaggeratedly cute, maintaining aesthetic consistency typical of chibi designs. This intentional design maintains a realistic portrayal within the stylistic confines of chibi art.",

      "question": "Does the Polaroid photograph holding the scene appear naturally integrated into the overall composition without any distortion or unnatural placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Polaroid photograph holding the scene shows clear alignment and proper scale relative to the fingers holding it. The scene inside the photograph is consistent without distortion. The placement of the photograph and the scene within appears cohesive and fits naturally within the overall composition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the materials and textures of the kayak and skateboard remained consistent and undistorted after the addition of the chibi figure and Polaroid frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures and materials of the kayak and skateboard appear unchanged and natural even with the stylistic modification of the chibi figure and introduction of the Polaroid frame. The kayak retains its vibrant yellow and the skateboard its typical texture, reflecting a consistent look as seen in Image A. There are no textures or material distortions present.",
