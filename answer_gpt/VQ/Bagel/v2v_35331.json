      "question": "Does the transition between the dog and the banana appear smooth and natural without any visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no noticeable seam or unnatural edge between the dog and the banana. The dog and the banana are positioned next to each other, and the transition lines between the two objects appear smooth. There is no obvious visual disruption between them, indicating a seamless composition.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the dog and the banana consistent with each other and the surrounding grass, indicating a natural light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on both the dog and banana is consistent, with shadows that match the position and intensity of a natural light source, as indicated by the uniform brightness and shadow direction. The surrounding grass also shows consistent lighting, with no detectable discrepancy in the lighting of the different elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or loss of fine details where the dog and the banana connect, disrupting the visual quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures on both the dog’s fur and the banana’s peel are distinct and appear intact without interruptions. The area where the two objects come close does not show any apparent loss of detail or unnatural texture, indicating a cohesive and high-quality visual quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the dog and the banana remain realistic and proportional to each other, avoiding any unnatural stretching or shrinking?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions between the dog and the banana are exaggerated, as bananas are typically much smaller compared to dogs. However, the edited image seems to have aimed for a playful, exaggerated portrayal rather than a realistic comparison. Nevertheless, upon technical terms, this is not proportional if we go strictly by natural size comparisons.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the materials of the dog's fur and the banana's peel retain their natural texture and appearance, contributing to the overall realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's fur seems detailed and natural, familiar to real dog appearances. The banana’s peel also retains its natural glossiness and speckled texture. Both maintain a realistic texture which contributes effectively to the visual realism despite the exaggerated size portrayal.",
