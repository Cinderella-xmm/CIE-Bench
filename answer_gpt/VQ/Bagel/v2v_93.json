      "question": "Does the 3D cartoon style of the thermometer maintain its structural consistency without introducing unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thermometer is designed with a 3D cartoon style. This includes smooth, rounded geometric shapes that reflect common design characteristics in cartoons, such as simplicity and slight exaggeration in proportions. The structure lacks any unnatural distortions, maintaining the integrity of the circular dial and hands, which are appropriate for a cartoon design, ensuring that no broken lines are visible and the overall structural component is consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the soft lighting effects on the thermometer's metallic surface natural, enhancing its finish without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B's lighting effects, the soft light reflections maintain the shine typical of metal surfaces, enhancing the appearance of the metallic frame without overpowering the thermometer's other features or introducing textures that seem out of place. There's no noticeable loss of fine details, allowing the surface to look refined and polished within the cartoon style, naturally fitting the intended aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the added stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10Â°C] appear naturally integrated into the design without causing visual clutter or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the indication of stats such as 'Temperature Range' and 'Accuracy' are not directly visible in the form presented. There is reference to 'Temeruiges + 1.10' which might relate to such stats but is not in a conventional format that directly matches the described elements. Without clear presentation, these stats don't appear as integrated, rather the details that are visually present are part of non-standard text which doesn't show classic numeric stats integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the title banner and nameplate text elements positioned logically and clearly visible, contributing to the overall visual credibility without disrupting the layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title banner and nameplate elements are strategically positioned at the top and bottom sections, ensuring they are easy to spot without interfering with the primary thermometer design. The text within these elements is readable and seems logically placed, offering a coherent layout with clear visual separation, contributing positively to the card's presentation without disrupting its layout.",

      "question": "Do the crisp borders and cool-toned background complement the thermometer's function and appearance, maintaining a professional and authentic look without introducing visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs crisp borders around the card, coupled with a cool-toned blue background that complements the theme. This color scheme highlights the metal of the thermometer impressively, aligning with expectations of a precision instrument's design. The borders are clear-cut, enhancing the authenticity and professionalism without artifacts, thereby supporting the function and appearance intended for such a styled card.",
