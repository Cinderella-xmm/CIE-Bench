      "question": "Are the braids on the alpaca’s neck and head seamlessly integrated with metallic ornaments and amulets without visible texture mismatches or broken strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the alpaca’s neck and head feature braids with numerous metallic ornaments and amulets. Seamless integration would require these elements to appear naturally woven into or attached to the braids without evident breaks in the hair strands or mismatched textures. The visual cues show that the metallic elements seem well-aligned and naturally positioned within the braids, suggesting a cohesive appearance without noticeable disjunctions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the newly added Norse-style garments around the alpaca’s body show coherent patterns and visible runic inscriptions without jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Norse-style garments added around the alpaca’s body should display clear and coherent patterns with visible inscriptions such as runes. An absence of jagged edges or texture artifacts would indicate high-quality integration into the image. The visual examination indicates that the runic patterns appear crisp and distinct, with well-defined edges, revealing no significant texture mismatches.",

      "question": "Are the standing stones in the background positioned naturally within the forest scene, with proper scale, shadowing, and mist effects that match the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image's background includes standing stones that need to be consistent with the forest scene regarding scale, shadowing, and atmospheric effects like mist. For natural integration, stones should reflect appropriate size relative to surrounding elements, and shadows should correspond to the lighting conditions. However, since this description pertains more to the area related to the second image, the stones may not directly reflect the forest environment as expected in the first image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the metallic components and amulets in the braids anchored realistically, with no floating elements or unnatural angles that suggest poor integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, metallic components and amulets appear embedded within the braids. For realistic anchoring, these items should not appear to float or be at awkward angles that don't match the natural flow of the hair. Upon evaluation, the components and amulets seem adequately positioned and aligned, indicating a realistic appearance without evidence of poor integration.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the alpaca’s facial features, including eyes, nose, and mouth, proportionally correct and aligned with the rest of the head despite added accessories and styling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, various accessories and styling have been added, yet it's vital for the core features such as eyes, nose, and mouth to remain proportionally correct and well-aligned with the head. Although direct examination is obstructed due to blurring, general alignment with the visible elements surrounding the face suggests coherent positional integrity of the facial features with no overt disproportion.",
