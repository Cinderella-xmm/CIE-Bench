      "question": "Is the enlarged hat proportionally consistent with the man's head size and does it retain natural texture and edge definition without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat is visually quite large and seems exaggerated in size, giving it a cartoonish appearance which aligns with the overall chibi-style design. This disproportion, however, is consistent with the exaggerated features often found in such designs. Despite the size, the hat's texture and edge definition appear smooth and without any signs of geometric distortion like pixelation or unusual shapes.",

      "question": "Are the embroidered patterns on the vest clearly defined, aligned with the fabric texture, and free from jagged edges or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vest's embroidered patterns are presented in a chibi-style fashion with noticeable exaggeration similar to cartoonish designs. The patterns are clear, have well-defined details, and appear aligned with the fabric texture. There are no indications of jagged edges or color bleeding, as the bright and bold style is consistent throughout the image.",

      "question": "Do the exaggerated shoe laces maintain a logical attachment to the shoe and show consistent shading and texture without appearing detached or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe laces are noticeably exaggerated, which is a typical feature of chibi art styles. However, they seem logically attached to the shoes, as the laces follow a realistic pattern that one would expect on actual shoes. The shading and texture are consistent with the rest of the illustration, and nothing about them suggests they are detached or distorted.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the manâ€™s face and body maintain anatomical consistency, with correctly positioned features and no visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the proportions are not realistic, they are consistent with the chibi art style which intentionally exaggerates certain features and simplifies others. The overall body structure appears coherent within this style, with correct positioning of limbs and features, but the proportions are intentionally altered, meaning anatomical consistency is maintained within the context of an exaggerated style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition between the man and the illustrated background smooth, with consistent lighting and perspective across the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is set against a simple, illustrative background that complements the chibi style. The transition between the man and the background appears smooth, with lighting and perspective that are consistent within the cartoonish style. There is no stark contrast or misalignment that would break the visual harmony of the scene.",
