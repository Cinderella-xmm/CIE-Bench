      "question": "Does the brocade gown have natural-looking folds and volume in the puffy sleeves and skirt, with no stretched or flattened areas that contradict fabric behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brocade gown in Image B showcases voluminous and intricate details on the sleeves and skirt. The folds appear natural, simulating the behavior of heavy fabric with embroidered patterns, which typically do not stretch or flatten unnaturally. By considering the structure of historical garments and fabric behavior, it is clear that the design maintains realistic proportions and movement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the rose blossoms evenly distributed along the branches with natural petal shapes and color variation, and do they align with the direction of light without appearing pasted or duplicated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rose blossoms are arranged more consistently, with petal shapes and color variation that mimic realistic flowers. The alignment of blossoms follows the light direction, avoiding artificial appearances. The distribution is harmonious without signs of repetition or duplication, maintaining organic variety like real rose bushes.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues have consistent line work, proper shadowing, and spatial alignment with the ground plane and surrounding trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wrought-iron gazebo and marble elements in Image B display accurate line work with realistic shadowing. These features align properly with the ground plane, considering their position relative to the trees. The construction suggests a coherent spatial relationship between all elements, reflecting advanced architectural design practices.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the left hand have five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and does the right hand grip the bow in a physically plausible manner without extra digits or distorted joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The left hand in Image B clearly has five fingers with proper spacing and natural curvature typical of human anatomy. The right hand grips the bow adeptly, indicating a plausible and skilled position without distorted features, maintaining anatomical realism and functionality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brocade patterns on the gown, the metal mesh of the gazebo, and the stone texture of the statues free from repeating tiles, pixelation, or unnatural smoothness that suggests low-resolution generation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brocade patterns on the gown, along with the metal and stone textures in Image B, show no evidence of repetitive tiles or pixelation. These elements exhibit finely detailed, high-resolution characteristics, ensuring organic texture and pattern consistency that aligns with sophisticated and realistic rendering standards.",
