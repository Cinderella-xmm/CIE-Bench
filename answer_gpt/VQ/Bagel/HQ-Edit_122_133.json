      "question": "Do the anthropomorphic cardinal and blue jay have proportionally correct limbs and body structures that maintain anatomical plausibility without visible deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features anthropomorphic birds, cardinal and blue jay, rendered as figurines with stylized and exaggerated features typical of such designs. Their limbs are proportioned to fit the toy-like aesthetic rather than aiming for anatomical accuracy according to real bird structures. The simplified and rounded forms show intentional stylization instead of anatomical correctness meant for artistic interpretation, making them appear without any visible deformation specific to their context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Victorian garments worn by the cardinal and blue jay rendered with clear, consistent texture and stitching, free from pixelation, blurring, or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, neither bird figurine is dressed in Victorian garments. The cardinal is depicted in a winter-themed icicle box. The blue jay is placed in a wooden alcove with winter decor. Therefore, there are no garments or clothing texture present to analyze for clarity, stitching, or material inconsistencies.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the miniature stage and alcove elements positioned with proper depth and alignment, and do icicles and pine accents adhere to gravitational and spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features figurines positioned within small boxed scenesâ€”one with icicles for the cardinal and one with an alcove for the blue jay. The positioning of the elements appears to adhere to gravity, with icicles facing downwards and the decor within the alcove showing spatial consistency. Elements like the pine accents are placed logically within these miniature environments, maintaining appropriate depth perception and alignment typical in crafted diorama settings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all miniature seasonal elements (e.g., ornaments, snowflakes) properly scaled, cast realistic shadows, and aligned with the lighting direction of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features miniature elements like pine cones and snow within boxed diorama settings. These elements appear proportionally scaled and placed within the boxes without apparent visual distortion. Shadows or reflections might be more stylized to fit the crafted look of the diorama setting, but the overall lighting direction is consistent with the diorama context.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the split-frame border clean and seamless, with no visible artifacts, distortion, or color bleeding at the boundary between the two scenes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have a split-frame structure like Image A; instead, it consists of two separate boxed diorama scenes that are next to each other. Since there's no split-frame border between scenes as seen in Image A, a direct analysis regarding artifacts or color bleeding at any boundary is not applicable.",
