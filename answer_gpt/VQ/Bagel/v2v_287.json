      "question": "Does the 3D voxel model of the train maintain its original shape and proportions, avoiding any distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is represented as a 3D voxel model, which is characterized by block-like geometric shapes typical of voxel art style. The contours of the train, including its body and distinct features, appear unbroken and retain an accurate representation without distortion, consistent with voxel art's emphasis on simplified yet proportionate forms.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the train's surface, such as windows and lights, clear and free from unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The voxel model in Image B simplifies the train's surface, and while detailed features like windows and lights are not depicted with high precision. As a result, these elements do not feature the same level of intricacy found in Image A and have generic block shapes with basic color applications to suggest windows rather than detailed textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the materials and colors of the 3D voxel model train match the style of the icons, ensuring a natural and consistent appearance with the rest of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The voxel model of the train in Image B is consistent with the overall visual style, which focuses on block-like forms and vibrant colors. The simplified color palette complements the icon's appearance in the surrounding environment, maintaining coherence in the visual style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the 3D voxel model train and the real-world elements seamless, without introducing any visible artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition in Image B is hindered by the disparity between the stylized voxel art of the train and the realistic elements of the station platform. This creates a visible inconsistency, as the simplified and blocky train model does not blend seamlessly with the real-world elements depicted in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement and orientation of the 3D voxel model train within the station platform appear natural and consistent with the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train in Image B is positioned on the tracks similar to typical real-world scenarios, aligning directionally with how an actual train would be placed. However, the voxel representation creates a disparity when considered against the environment's comprehensive realism, but strictly speaking of orientation and general placement, it's consistent with the setting.",
