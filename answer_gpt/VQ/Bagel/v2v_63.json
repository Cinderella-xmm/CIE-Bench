      "question": "Do the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls accurately reflect the individual's attire and stance without introducing unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls are designed to mimic the attire and stance of the individual, with each doll wearing similar clothing—a pinkish top with blue pants/skirts—matching the individual's outfit. The dolls maintain rounded and consistent geometric shapes typical of chibi-style figures, avoiding any unnatural distortions or broken forms. The symmetry and proportions appear well-maintained, reflecting the original outfit and stance accurately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls consistent with the original image's style, avoiding unnatural artifacts and loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The comparison involves assessing if Image B's textures and materials align with Image A. The dolls, which are presented as polished and smooth, match the visual style seen in Image A's clothing and setting. The finish of the dolls is consistent with the typical look of manufactured polymer or plastic, which does not exhibit unnatural artifacts or loss of detail. Such visual cues suggest adherence to expected textures without degradation of quality.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the placement of the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls on the wooden table appear natural, with no visible artifacts or unnatural textures at the edges where they meet the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls in Image B are positioned seamlessly on the wooden table without any visible artifacts or misalignments that would create unnatural texture transitions. The edges where the dolls meet the table surface appear clean and coherent, avoiding jagged or blurred interactions that might disrupt the visual harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls arranged neatly in a horizontal line on the wooden table, with appropriate spacing between them, ensuring structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi-style dolls arranged in a clear horizontal line, with even spacing that maintains a visually orderly and consistent composition. This arrangement ensures structural consistency and prevents overlaps or gaps that could disrupt the neatness of the row.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain an aspect ratio of 3:2, ensuring that the visual composition remains balanced and coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Images are usually measured based on width to height to determine their aspect ratio. By visually assessing the layout of Image B, it seems to maintain a balanced proportion akin to the standard 3:2 aspect ratio, prominent in photographic compositions, ensuring that nothing feels stretched or compressed, thus achieving coherence.",
