      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the deep burgundy drapes hang naturally with smooth folds and consistent shadow gradients, and do they cast realistic shadows on the wall and floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the deep burgundy drapes are visually striking but display exaggerated folds and fabric details, which can appear somewhat unnatural. Shadows cast by these drapes show inconsistency, lacking realistic gradients on the wall and floor. World knowledge of fabric behavior suggests smooth folds should maintain consistent light and shadow gradients, and the shadows should naturally transition to surrounding surfaces.",

      "question": "Are the gold woodwork details on the bed frame continuous, symmetrical, and free from warped or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold woodwork details on the bed frame are elaborate with a visually symmetrical design. However, upon closer inspection, inconsistencies in symmetry and slight signs of geometric distortion can be noticed, especially as world knowledge suggests woodwork should show uniformity and precise craftsmanship.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cherub images on the pillows show visible brushstroke texture, subtle color gradients, and seamless integration into the pillow surface without sharp borders or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the cherub images on the pillows possess a smooth surface integration without evident brushstroke texture but the color gradients present are more flat rather than subtle. The integration seems digital due to sharp borders and potential pixelation artifacts, contrasting traditional artistic methods where brushstrokes and gradients contribute to texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the new canopy drapes and gold woodwork match the direction of the ceiling light and fall consistently on adjacent walls and floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows in Image B don't consistently follow the logical direction implied by the ceiling light source. Observing discrepancies in shadow direction and fall across surfaces implies a mismatch. Shadows, ideally, extend based on the primary light source's angle, something needed for consistency which is partially missing here.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the redesigned canopy bed fully contained within the room boundaries, with no parts extending beyond the ceiling or overlapping the wall, and does it maintain a realistic scale relative to the nightstand and rug?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the redesigned canopy bed is visually contained within the room's boundaries and does not extend beyond the ceiling or wall. However, scale challenges appear when compared to typical room objects like the nightstand and rug; the bed's grandeur seems disproportionate and somewhat unrealistic given standard room size considerations.",
