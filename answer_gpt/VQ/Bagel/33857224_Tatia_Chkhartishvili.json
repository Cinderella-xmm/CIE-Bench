    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head proportionally enlarged but still geometrically consistent with the neck and shoulders, without unnatural stretching or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head on the chibi keychain is deliberately designed to be larger than average, which is typical for chibi or cartoon styles. Despite the larger size, it is geometrically consistent with the neck and shoulders, because cartoon styles often exaggerate proportions while maintaining a logical shape and alignment. This aligns with the common characteristics of such artistic styles, where the head is intentionally accentuated but harmonized in relation to other body parts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the body, dress, and hair uniformly rendered with a soft rubber texture, free from conflicting textures or glossy reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi keychain in Image B appears to be made from a unified material such as soft rubber or plastic, as indicated by the matte finish and the smooth textures across the body, dress, and hair. This reflects a standard manufacturing process for keychains where the material is consistent, and no glossy reflections or non-uniform textures are present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red boots and lace dress clearly identifiable with preserved structural details such as buckles, stitching, and knit patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi keychain showcases the red boots and lace dress abstractly. Given the stylized nature, some details like the buckles and intricate knit patterns may not be as explicitly detailed as in reality, focusing more on capturing the essential appearance. Therefore, while general shapes and colors are identifiable, minute structural details like stitching may not be preserved in such abstract representations.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bent posture maintain anatomical alignment of the spine, hips, and knees without unnatural angles or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The posture of the character on the keychain in Image B imitates a bent posture which aligns with the common characteristics of stylized drawings where anatomy is simplified. While maintaining a playful bent pose, the alignment does not depict unnatural angles or floating segments, providing coherence in its composition typical for stylized characters.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the silver keyring visibly connected to the character without gaps or overlapping edges, and does the wooden plank background show consistent texture and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silver keyring on the chibi keychain is visibly connected to the character with no gaps or misaligned edges, suggesting a solid attachment designed for practical use. The wooden plank surface visible in the background appears uniform and evenly spaced, further confirming the consistent texture typical on such surfaces without any irregularities.",
