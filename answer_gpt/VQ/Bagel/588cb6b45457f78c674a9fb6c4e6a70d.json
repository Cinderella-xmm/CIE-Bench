    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the surface of the painted figure show consistent brushstroke patterns and subtle texture variations typical of oil paint on wood, without blocky or repetitive digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painted figure displays a consistent style indicative of digital art techniques rather than traditional oil paint on wood. The brushstroke patterns are smooth and uniform, lacking the nuanced texture variations of oil paint. There are no evident digital artifacts, maintaining a coherent appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the strands of the elongated beard and mustache maintain continuous, fiber-like structure without forming unnatural loops, droplets, or fluid-like surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elongated beard and mustache in Image B are drawn with a consistent and continuous fiber-like structure. They do not exhibit any loops or fluid-like surfaces; instead, they maintain a stylized, flowing appearance typical of digital illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the velvet texture of the cloak smooth and reflective with depth, and are the golden embroidery lines evenly spaced and aligned with the fabric folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the cloak with a smooth texture that suggests velvet, but the visual style is more graphic and lacks the depth found in real velvet reflections. The golden embroidery lines are evenly spaced, but the illustrative nature does not convincingly mimic fabric folds.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wide-brimmed hat positioned correctly on the head without distorting the skull shape, and are the peacock feathers attached along the brim with natural curvature and no clipping into the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wide-brimmed hat is accurately positioned on the head, maintaining the skull shape appropriately. The peacock feathers are attached to the hat with natural curvature and do not clip into the face, blending well with the overall design.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the brooch cast a soft shadow onto the cloak and reflect light consistently with its surroundings, indicating proper placement and integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brooch in Image B is prominently featured and integrated with the cloak, but it does not cast a soft shadow as might be expected in a photorealistic setting. The reflective effect is consistent within the stylized context of the illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the edges of the figure cleanly separated from the background without haloing, double outlines, or partial transparency that suggests poor compositing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of the figure in Image B are cleanly separated from the background with no signs of haloing, double outlines, or partial transparency. The compositing is smoothly executed within the digital art style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the eyes, nose, and mouth aligned symmetrically and proportionally consistent with the original face, with no stretching or warping caused by adjacent edits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the eyes, nose, and mouth are symmetrical and consistent within the stylized composition. There are no indications of stretching or warping affecting facial features due to adjacent edits.",
