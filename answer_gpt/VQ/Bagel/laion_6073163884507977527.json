      "question": "Does the glass dome cover the entire scene without distorting the underlying elements such as the house, tree, or ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a glass dome enclosing the scene without causing distortion. The dome covers the whole miniature landscape, including the house, ground, and trees, maintaining their original shapes. The dome acts as a protective cover, preserving the visual integrity of the enclosed objects with its transparency, as commonly a glass dome serves such a purpose.",

      "question": "Are the mossy green pathways aligned with the terrain level and blended naturally with the surrounding ground texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mossy green pathways appear seamless and are level with the surrounding terrain. They exhibit a natural blend with the grass-covered landscape, ensuring a coherent aesthetic. Typically, such designs aim to create a harmonious integration between different ground textures and plant elements.",

      "question": "Do the newly added shrubs have a size and texture consistent with the existing plants in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shrubs in Image B match the size and texture of other plants in the scene, including the trees and bushes. This consistency ensures a balanced visual composition, a common practice in miniature landscaping where elements should coexist without disproportion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a lake with well-defined edges and a reflective surface that appears to realistically interact with its surroundings. The water's reflective quality is commonly designed to mimic real-life water bodies, ensuring it complements the visual elements around it, like the bridge and grass.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fairy lights in Image B are wrapped around the branches uniformly, enhancing the trees' shape while emitting a soft glow. The lights' gentle illumination prevents harsh highlights, a typical feature for decorative lighting aiming for subtlety and ambience.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge is positioned across the lake, its supports firmly situated on the ground at each end. The structure appears stable, adhering to common architectural physics where bridges require solid grounding to maintain stability and functionality.",
