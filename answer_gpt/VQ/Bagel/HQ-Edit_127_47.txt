    "Question": "Q1: Are the trees, mountains, and water inside the glass orb correctly proportioned and undistorted despite the spherical enclosure, with no visible warping or bending of vertical lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spherical enclosure of the glass orb can naturally cause optical distortion, which may warp or bend vertical lines. However, the elements inside the orb, such as trees and mountains, appear correctly proportioned and maintain their straight and upright orientation without visible warping. This indicates that the design compensates well for spherical distortion, presenting undistorted vertical lines.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the ducks retain their natural body shape and size relative to the water and rocks, with smooth, reflective surfaces that do not show exaggerated shine or unnatural specular highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ducks are stylized figurines within a decorative glass orb. Their smooth surfaces and well-defined shapes don't reflect light in an exaggerated manner, which is typical for ceramic or plastic models, maintaining a natural and appropriate level of shine without unnatural specular highlights.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the water beneath the ducks transparent enough to clearly see the rocky bottom, with no visible layering artifacts, texture tiling, or unnatural opacity variations?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows water inside a glass orb that is depicted in a stylized manner, typical of decorative spheres. The water appears smoothly rendered with consistent opacity, allowing a clean view of the design beneath, free from layering artifacts or tiling imperfections.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the miniature animal figurines positioned on solid surfaces (rocks or ground), properly scaled compared to surrounding elements, and free from floating or unnatural shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figurines of the animals are placed on the rocks and ground within the orb. They appear properly scaled in relation to other elements like trees and ducks, and there is no evidence of them floating or casting unnatural shadows, enhancing the realism of the layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Does the wood base have a natural grain pattern and cast a consistent shadow under the orb, indicating physical contact and realistic lighting interaction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base of the glass orb displays a realistic wood grain texture and casts a shadow that suggests physical contact with the orb. The lighting interaction appears consistent and believable, contributing to the overall realism of the presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
