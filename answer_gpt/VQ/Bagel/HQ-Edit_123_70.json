    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the spectacles positioned correctly over the bear’s eyes without deforming the surrounding fur or causing unnatural lens reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear is depicted with spectacles that sit well on the eyes without disrupting the fur pattern. There are no unnatural lens reflections that would typically occur if the glasses were misplaced or improperly rendered. For it to look natural, the fur around the spectacles should be smoothly transitioning to the glasses, which is the case here.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bear’s facial expression show subtle aging features (like wrinkles) without distorting the nose, mouth, or jawline geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear’s face does not effectively exhibit aging features such as wrinkles. The nose, mouth, and jawline remain cartoonishly simple and rounded, which implies that subtle aging features like wrinkles are not present nor distorting the facial features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the speech bubble clearly connected to the bear’s mouth and does it not obscure or distort nearby fur or water details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble in Image B is positioned above and to the right of the bear and appears to be connected correctly to the bear’s mouth via a pointing arrow, without affecting the fur or nearby details like water in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the transformation chart fit naturally within the bear’s mouth without exceeding jaw limits or causing visible deformations in the mouth structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation chart is not placed inside the bear’s mouth; instead, it appears as a separate element. Hence, concerns about fitting within the bear's mouth or causing mouth structure deformation do not apply.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the labeled stages in the transformation chart aligned with the river surface and do they cast appropriate shadows or depth cues consistent with the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation chart is positioned in the lower part of the second panel without natural alignment with any river surface or depth cues provided. It appears more like a separate section with no integration into the main image scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the fact box positioned in an open area of the image (e.g., near the riverbank) without covering important details like tree trunks or water flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fact box is displayed in a separate panel beneath the bear and transformation chart and does not interfere with any key elements like tree trunks or water flow in the main bear image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the text in the speech bubble and fact box rendered with clean edges and no pixelation or aliasing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases cleanly rendered text within both the speech bubble and the fact box, with edges free of pixelation or aliasing artifacts. The text is clearly legible with smooth contours.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do the blue hues in the transformation chart and the brown-green tones in the forest background match the original image’s color grading without noticeable shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation chart and forest background in Image B present a stylized color scheme inconsistent with Image A. The hues lack seamless integration with the original image's color grading; noticeable shifts are visible as the transformation chart is brightly blue contrasting with the earthy forest tones.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are the bear’s fur strands and water splashes still visible and detailed around the added speech bubble and transformation chart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur strands and water details are part of the separate panel below the speech bubble while the transformation chart does not interfere directly with these details. The panels do not overlap these elements so there are no disruptions to their visibility.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",
      "question": "Do both panels occupy their intended regions within the 16:9 frame without cutting off the bear’s legs or the tree line at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition is divided into two panels where the bear's upper body, along with the forest background, fits within its allocated space above and separate from the transformation chart below. The bear’s legs or tree line are not cut off by panel edges, maintaining a coherent format.",
      "weight": 1,
