      "question": "Does the transition from the realistic depiction of the patient to the pop-art comic design appear smooth without introducing unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition to a pop-art comic style involves bold colors, halftone patterns, and solid outlines, which are characteristic of this art style. The transition seems intentional as it mimics the expected texture and look of pop-art, which often embraces striking contrasts instead of smooth transitions between elements. The use of colors and patterns aligns with the style, which inherently does not require smooth transitions like those expected in a realistic depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the halftone patterns and bold graphical details added to the image consistent with the rest of the scene and do not look out of place or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, halftone patterns are uniformly applied across the scene, which is typical of the pop-art style. This consistency in the application of halftone patterns across various elements like the patient, IV bag, and medical equipment helps maintain a coherent and consistent comic book aesthetic throughout the image. The elements do not appear distorted, suggesting a thoughtful application of the style.",

      "question": "Do the core elements like the IV stand, monitors, and nurse retain their structural integrity and remain visually credible within the pop-art comic design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the core elements such as the IV stand, monitors, and nurse are redrawn with clear outlines and solid fills typical of comic pop-art, but they retain their structural integrity. Despite the shift in style, which relies on symbolic rather than realistic depiction, these elements remain recognizable and credible within their new context, adhering to the stylistic norms of pop-art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the shapes of objects such as the bed, pillows, and medical equipment been preserved without distortion or damage in the pop-art comic design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shapes of the bed, pillows, and medical equipment are retained within the pop-art comic interpretation. While the stylistic details differ from realism, the overall forms are maintained, allowing these objects to be quickly identified. The design choice preserves the integrity of their shapes despite the exaggerated outlines and color blocks typical of the style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the patient's facial features and the nurse's uniform preserved without loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts in the pop-art comic design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nature of pop-art reduces the need for fine details and rather focuses on stylized representation. The facial features of the patient are intentionally left without detailed depiction, consistent with comic styling. Similarly, the nurse's uniform is illustrated without the need for intricate detail but is instead represented by bold lines and blocks of color. This is not seen as a loss or introduction of artifacts but as a faithful adaptation to the style.",
