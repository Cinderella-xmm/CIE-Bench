      "question": "Are the eyes and mouth of the horse in both panels correctly positioned and proportionally consistent with the original plush design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is depicted in a cartoonish style with large eyes and a big smile, which is typical of stylized cartoon representations. The plush horse in Image A has more realistically proportioned features for a plush toy, with smaller eyes and a subtle mouth. The cartoon exaggerates these features for comedic effect, which is a common practice and not necessarily meant to be proportionally accurate in comparison to the original. Hence, the eyes and mouth are not proportionally consistent with the original plush design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lasso above the horse's head shaped naturally and positioned so that it appears to be twirling in mid-air without intersecting or clipping through the horse's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lasso is drawn in the second panel above the horse's head. It appears to be a loop in motion, typical of a lasso being spun. The line art and lack of any intersection with the horse's body give the lasso a clear outline suggesting it is correctly positioned in mid-air. Therefore, it does not intersect or clip through the horse's body and is depicted as twirling naturally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cacti and wooden saloon buildings in the background align with the horizon line and cast shadows consistent with the light source direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cacti and saloon buildings appear in the background consistently across the panels. They are set against a blue sky, indicating a clear horizon line. The shadows on the ground seem to be cast in a uniform direction, which would align with a specific light source. This implies a consistent lighting position in harmony with the horizon. The cartoon style maintains visual logic with regard to environment positioning and shadow casting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fur texture of the horse and the plastic details of the rocking base clearly visible and not blurred or oversimplified due to stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the horse in a highly stylized cartoon manner, typical of animation and illustration styles. The details such as fur texture and intricate mechanical elements of the rocking base are simplified into bold line art and flat color fills, which omit detailed textures like fur or plastic surfaces found in Image A. This choice aligns with common illustrative practices to create a more playful and accessible visual. Thus, the texture details are oversimplified due to the cartoon style.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text “Wild, Wild Horse Adventures!” positioned at the top of the image without overlapping any part of the horse or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Wild, Wild Horse Adventures!' is positioned prominently at the top of the image. It is meant to serve as a title or header and is placed against a clear blue sky area that ensures no overlap with any character or environmental introductions immediately below it in the panels. This avoids any visual clutter or obstruction of the primary scene depicted in the comic panels.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the legs and rocking base of the horse proportionally accurate and aligned with the original mechanical structure, even after stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's legs are depicted in an exaggerated manner typical of cartoon styles, which means they do not closely follow the original mechanical structure and proportions depicted in Image A. The rocking base is completely absent or stylized into cartoon ground movement representation. Therefore, proportional alignment with the original mechanical structure is not maintained.",
