      "question": "Is the horse’s head enlarged proportionally so that facial features like the eyes and muzzle remain clearly defined and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toy horse has an enlarged head compared to a real horse, akin to 'chibi' style designs that feature exaggerated proportions for cuteness. The facial features—eyes and muzzle—are clearly defined and retain their intended shapes without distortion. The oversized head is characteristic of plush toys, which often emphasize these proportions for visual appeal.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the body of the plush horse display a consistent fabric texture with soft, non-reflective surfaces and no abrupt transitions between color regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the plush horse maintains a consistency in fabric texture characterized by a soft, matte finish typical of plush materials. The color transitions are smooth, particularly between the brown body and white patches, fitting the design style of plush toys with seamless and intentional color changes.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes and mouth of the plush horse depicted with visible stitching patterns and raised texture consistent with embroidery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the plush toy's eyes and mouth with distinct patterns suggesting embroidery, such as visible stitching and raised textures that are common in plush toys. These features use embroidery techniques to create durability and a tactile embellishment.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the legs of the plush horse appear short and thick with smooth, rounded shapes and no distorted or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs of the plush horse are designed to be short and thick, fitting the iconic cute and stubby form factor of plush toys. They exhibit smooth curves and solid geometry, enhancing the toy's aesthetic without any signs of distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dandelions in the foreground composed of flat, circular felt-like discs on straight stems, lacking naturalistic detail or depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features dandelions that have a stylized appearance with circular, felt-like pom-poms as flower heads. Their stems are straight and uniform. These elements are indicative of crafted or artificial flowers lacking the complexity of real dandelions, aligned with a toy or model design for simplicity.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the forest background rendered as a flat, untextured plane with no depth cues such as overlapping trees or atmospheric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the forest background is simplified into flat cutouts representing trees without depth due to overlapping or atmospheric cues. This approach aligns with the boxed diorama design where backgrounds are meant to provide simple thematic context rather than realistic depth.",
