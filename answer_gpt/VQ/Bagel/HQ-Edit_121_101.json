      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the sleeves and collar clearly defined with clean, sharp edges consistent with a paper-cut style, and do they feature uniform metallic foil highlights without smudging or color bleed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the sleeves and collar are designed in a paper-cut style, characterized by sharp and clean edges typical of such designs. Metallic foil highlights are uniform, showing neither smudging nor color bleed, consistent with paper-cut artistry known for precision.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the enlarged bow positioned centrally and symmetrically on the jeogori, maintaining smooth fabric folds around it without unnatural creasing or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow is prominently displayed on the jeogori. The position is central and symmetrical, ensuring balance. The fabric around the bow exhibits smooth, natural folds devoid of unnatural creases or distortions, maintaining the artistic integrity and style of the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the roof lines and structural components of the background architecture maintain proper alignment and perspective, avoiding skewed angles or floating elements that suggest structural inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background architecture, created in a paper-cut style, maintains alignment and perspective. The roof lines and structural elements are arranged consistently, without skewed angles or floating elements. This ensures a coherent representation, typical of skilled paper-cut artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the embossed leather-bound panel uniformly textured across its surface, with no visible seams or irregularities where the stamped elements meet the background, and does it provide a consistent depth impression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leather-bound panel in Image B exhibits a uniform texture, characteristic of embossed craftsmanship. There are no visible seams or irregularities, ensuring a seamless blend where the stamped elements meet the background, enhancing the depth impression and quality of the artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the chain have exactly five fingers with natural joint curvature and skin texture, and does the chain follow a continuous, non-intersecting path without breaking or appearing detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the chain is stylized and abstracted as part of the paper-cut design. Due to this stylization, the hand doesn't exhibit natural joint curvature or skin texture. The chain is also part of the abstract design, following a stylized path rather than a realistic one. Thus, common considerations of anatomy and continuous paths do not strictly apply here.",
