      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility without any unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style cartoon tiger exhibits smooth and consistent textures typical of 3D animation. The details such as stripes and facial features are clearly defined, maintaining structural credibility and visual consistency. Such features ensure that it adheres to common stylized cartoon aesthetics, signifying that no unnatural textures or loss of detail is evident.",

      "question": "Does the whimsical park backdrop with soft pastel hues, cherry blossom trees, and rose petals appear photorealistic and integrate naturally with the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's park backdrop is designed using soft pastels and features cherry blossom trees and rose petals, which are stylistically consistent with the cartoon theme. Although not photorealistic due to its vibrant and stylized design, this consistency in style ensures integration with the chibi-style tiger is natural, despite the aesthetic not leaning toward realistic depiction.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral arch in Image B is part of a coherent pastel theme and is smoothly integrated within the scene. It does not present any obvious artifacts, nor does it disrupt the visual flow of the cartoonish backdrop, thus enhancing the scene naturally.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger holding the skateboard realistic and does the action of holding the skateboard appear physically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style tiger is depicted without a skateboard, eliminating the need to assess holding proportions or physical plausibility. This indicates a conceptual switch from Image A, where the object was present, hence inquiries into realistic proportions or plausible actions do not apply.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a unified aesthetic, where each element from the tiger to the park background is cohesively designed in a stylized manner typical of 3D animation. There are no artifacts or distortions disrupting the visual integrity, ensuring an authentic appearance even when stylized.",
