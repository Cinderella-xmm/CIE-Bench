      "question": "Does the transformed roof retain its triangular silhouette with smooth, continuous edges and display detailed icy etchings that appear integrated into the surface rather than overlaid or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where a cabin or shelter might have been is now dominated by a large, egg-like structure with a highly detailed surface. This structure doesn't resemble a typical roof but has a continuous, smooth exterior adorned with intricate, icy-looking etchings that seem to be part of the material itself. The characteristics described do not match a triangular roof silhouette; rather, they fit this new, dominant object in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the snow-covered areas transformed into wing-like forms that exhibit consistent translucency, subtle internal light diffusion, and seamless integration with the surrounding terrain without visible seams or unnatural brightness gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual transformation focuses primarily on the large central object, with no explicit transformation of snow-covered areas into wing-like shapes. The elements around the structure do not display these described characteristics of translucency or integration akin to wings. Thus, the criteria outlined for the snow-covered transformation are not observed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the rocky outcrops in the foreground and midground form leg-like structures with anatomically plausible proportions, smooth transitions between segments, and moss textures that match the surrounding environment without appearing pasted or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocky outcrops have been transformed into leg-like, arachnid structures with glowing, segmented appearance. These structures exhibit smooth transitions between segments and maintain moss textures that blend well with the terrain. The proportions and the textural continuity indicate a plausible integration with the landscape, avoiding the appearance of being pasted or distorted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stream display a uniform, low-intensity glow along its entire length that follows the natural flow path, without sudden bright spots, broken lines, or inconsistent illumination patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stream retains its natural appearance from Image A, without any evident transformation into a glowing entity. It does not exhibit any glow or altered lighting effects that the question addresses, maintaining its original river-like characteristics.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the fog layer distributed evenly across the upper mountain regions and seamlessly blended with the sky and terrain, preserving depth cues and avoiding abrupt transitions or unnatural cloud formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fog distribution over the mountains remains consistent with Image A, demonstrating an even spread that gradually blends with the sky and terrain, thereby maintaining depth cues. No abrupt changes or artificial cloud formations are visible, preserving the natural mountainous atmosphere.",
