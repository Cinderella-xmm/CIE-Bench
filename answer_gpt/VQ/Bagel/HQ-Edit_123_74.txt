    "Question": "Q1: Is the helmet proportionally enlarged but still maintaining a coherent shape and realistic placement on the head without visible deformation or unnatural edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet is depicted in a larger style typical for cartoon renditions, which often exaggerate features for a stylized effect. Despite this enlargement, it maintains a coherent shape and appears realistically placed on the head without any visible deformation or unnatural edges. This maintains the visual coherence of the cartoon character design.",

    "Question": "Q2: Do the hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural joint alignment and no signs of distortion, stretching, or additional digits?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are rendered in a simplified cartoon style where detailing such as finger count may be abstract or stylized. The hands are depicted as mittens without distinct fingers, which is common in stylized animation and illustration. Thus, the question of having five fingers doesn't apply in the same manner but maintains a coherent cartoon style.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the red tones on the snowsuit vivid but still consistent with fabric texture, without appearing overly glossy, pixelated, or disconnected from the underlying material?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snowsuit features vibrant red tones consistent with a cartoon art style. While lacking the fabric texture details found in realistic images, the color tone is vivid and fits well within the overall stylized aesthetic of the cartoon without appearing pixelated or disconnected from the character design.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the snow and tree outlines cleanly separated into layered shapes resembling paper cuts, without gaps, overlapping distortions, or floating fragments?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses a simplified graphic design style with clean, crisp outlines resembling paper cut shapes. The snow and tree outlines are distinctly separated, without gaps or overlapping distortions. This style aligns with a flat illustration approach where elements are compartmentalized and visually coherent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the snowboarder's body posture aligned with the direction of the snowboard, showing balanced weight distribution and no floating limbs or impossible angles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder's posture is dynamically depicted in line with the direction of the snowboard, indicating balanced weight distribution typical in stylized art. The limbs are positioned appropriately without any unrealistic angles or floating elements, maintaining the coherence of the cartoon design.",
