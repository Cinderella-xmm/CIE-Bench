      "question": "Does the dancer have exactly one visible arm extended in a dynamic pose, with no additional limbs or distorted joints present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dancer with multiple arms extended, resembling the depiction of deities in various forms of art where multiple arms signify power or grace. This is a deliberate artistic choice and not a realistic portrayal of human anatomy. Thus, there are additional limbs visible, which eliminates the possibility of having just one arm extended.",
