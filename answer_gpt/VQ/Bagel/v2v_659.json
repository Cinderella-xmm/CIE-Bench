      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style mascot maintain the structural consistency of the original person's features without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi-style mascot retains human-like features typical of such designs, with rounded shapes and simplified anatomy. It maintains a consistency in proportions, such as keeping the crown on the head and the long hair. Comparing to Image A, although simplified, the features maintain similarity without distortion beyond the style norms of chibi designs. Therefore, the structural consistency is maintained without unnatural distortions.",

      "question": "Are the crown and royal accents on the 3D chibi-style mascot free from unnatural textures and maintain their detailed integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crown on the mascot has a smooth texture with defined accents that align with typical 3D rendering styles, ensuring coherence in its design. The details are consistent without jagged edges or texture distortion, which suggests the detailed integrity is maintained. Image A shows a more realistic crown, but in both images, the crown maintains its integrity respective to each style.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cereal box has gold patterns which are part of a printed design. The patterns are clear, and the textures do not show pixelation or misalignment typical of design artifacts. It appears to be well-rendered with clear motifs consistent with printed box designs. This suggests the patterns and textures are naturally rendered and free from artifacts.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's cereal box features gold and royal motifs on its packaging, extending the royal theme from the mascot.
