    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the figure's raised leg and upper arm maintain continuous, smooth curvature without sharp breaks or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's posture is simplified in a stylized manner, characteristic of cartoon or illustration styles. The raised leg and arm do form smooth and unbroken curves in this stylized portrayal. Despite the figure being a simplistic illustration, it ensures that the curves are continuous, matching the cartoonish aesthetic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the figure's clothing and the surrounding environment (sky, sand, water) unified in tone, with no abrupt shifts or clashing hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of colors is quite consistent and unified. The figure's clothing is teal, which complements the muted earth tones of the environment, such as the sandy beach and the greenish sky, fitting the overall palette used in the illustration style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the angle between the neck and torso consistent with human flexibility, and do the extended arms show smooth, uninterrupted lines without kinks or bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is drawn in a simplified and stylized manner, which lacks anatomical accuracy that might be seen in realistic art. The neck and torso depiction is consistent within this cartoon style, with the arms forming smooth lines that are characteristic of this type of illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the textures on the figure’s skin and clothing show consistent shading and fine detail without visible pixelation or smeared regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B adopts a flat color style typical of digital illustrations where textures are often minimal or absent, opting for smooth color transitions instead. Therefore, there are no visible pixelation or smeared regions in the depiction of the figure's skin or clothing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the foot have exactly five fingers, each with natural curvature and proper contact with the foot, without overlapping or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design is minimalist and stylized, and precise anatomical details like fingers are often less distinct. The illustration style does not focus on detailing digits in a realistic manner, thus it's hard to discern individual fingers clearly, reflecting this artistic choice.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the shadow beneath the figure aligned with the sun’s position in the sky and does it taper naturally toward the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not actually show a shadow beneath the figure, as it is styled with flatness typical in cartoon illustrations where such details are not emphasized. The focus is more on the figure itself rather than environmental realism or depth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible halos, jagged edges, or blending errors along the outline of the figure, particularly around the raised leg and arm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a stylized illustration, uses smooth lines and clearly defined forms without the complexity that might cause halos or jagged edges. The outline remains clean, consistent with vector-based digital art norms where simplicity and clarity are prioritized.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
