      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the robot figures derived from the batteries have limbs and heads that are proportionally sized and attached in a way that maintains structural coherence with their original cylindrical form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot figures appear to be modeled in a cartoonish style, with exaggerated features which sometimes happens in stylized art. Their limbs and heads are not proportionally sized compared to realistic anatomical standards; for example, the heads are larger, and the limbs are oversized compared to real proportions. Despite these artistic choices, the structure does maintain a visual coherence suggesting they were transformed from battery shapes into humanoid robots, given their cylindrical torsos that resemble the original battery form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the robot figures made from the batteries rendered with a consistent metallic texture that mimics copper and black materials without visible artifacts like checkerboard patterns or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robots in Image B have a surface that appears shiny and reflective, mimicking a metallic texture which aligns with copper and matte black, similar to materials found in batteries. The rendering does not show visible artifacts such as checkerboard patterns or unnatural reflections, suggesting a consistent quality in texturing.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the digital cityscape background positioned behind the robot figures with correct layering, atmospheric gradient, and light source alignment that matches the direction of illumination on the robots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cityscape background features a gradient from orange to purple, creating depth that is typical of atmospheric effects. The light source in the background seems to align with the front lighting on the robots, as suggested by highlights on their surfaces. This indicates correct layering and alignment are considered in its composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the digital screen displaying “10 Years in Storage” seamlessly integrated into the scene with readable text, smooth edges, and ambient lighting that matches the sci-fi theme without pixelation or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital screen in Image B shows the text '10 Years Strrjog' with some stylistic choices that match the overall scene theme. While the text is readable, it appears that the font choice or integration resulted in a non-standard spelling ('Strrjog') visible in the text. Despite this, the edge quality, lighting, and alignment with the sci-fi theme are well-maintained without pixelation or distortion.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title \"Duracell Guardians: Power Preserve Adventures!\" displayed in a clean, bold, futuristic font with uniform stroke width and no visual artifacts like jagged edges or overlapping glyphs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title in Image B reads as 'Duracell Ghanana Power Geations Pervererve Adutteres' suggesting some irregularity in letter arrangement and selection, which deviates from readability and coherence. The font attempts to be bold and futuristic, but the lettering and word choices present overlapping glyphs and non-standard word forms, suggesting some visual artifacts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the robot figures, title, and digital screen arranged in a way that avoids overlapping text or important visual elements, ensuring all components are legible and distinct?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the elements maintains clear separation; the robots, text, and digital screen are positioned to avoid overlap and maintain their distinctiveness. This careful composition ensures that the components are legible and important visual elements do not obstruct one another.",
