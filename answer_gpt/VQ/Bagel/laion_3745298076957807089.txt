    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass stopper on the bottle have a smooth, reflective surface consistent with real glass, and does it fit proportionally with the bottle's neck without appearing oversized or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is topped with a black cap rather than a glass stopper. Despite the capâ€™s smooth surface, it is not designed to mimic glass, as it lacks transparency and reflectivity typical of glass.
