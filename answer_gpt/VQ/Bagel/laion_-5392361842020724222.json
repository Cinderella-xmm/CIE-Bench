      "question": "Does the gilded brocade texture on the kneeling figure's robe show consistent metallic sheen and intricate pattern details without unnatural highlights or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kneeling figure’s robe displays a rich, metallic brocade pattern that appears consistent in its luster and detail, which denotes a high-quality, coherent texture application. The highlights and intricacies seem evenly distributed, mirroring the typical appearance of brocade fabrics known for their exquisite ornamentation. There seems to be no evidence of artificial highlights or repetitive textures, as each visible area maintains uniformity and detail.",

      "question": "Is the velvet texture on the standing figure's cloak rendered with natural depth, soft shading, and smooth transitions between folds without abrupt edges or unnatural compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cloak of the standing figure reveals a velvet-like texture that suggests depth and softness. The shading appears gradual, and the folds transition smoothly which contributes to the realistic portrayal of velvet. The shading follows the natural contour of the fabric without showing any abrupt or compressed transitions that could indicate an unnatural rendering.",

      "question": "Are the silver swaddling bands wrapped around the infant’s body correctly aligned with anatomical contours and free from gaps, overlaps, or misplaced reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silver swaddling bands on the infant appear to be carefully wrapped to align with the infant’s anatomical contours. The arrangement looks deliberate, free from gaps or overlapping sections in the visible portions. The reflective quality of the bands is consistent, not exhibiting reflections that seem misplaced with respect to the light source.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the columns and divine motifs are designed to fit the overall perspective and scale of the scene. They provide a backdrop of appropriate size relative to the figures and exhibit foreshortening that gives depth to the image. The shadow direction appears to be coherent with the lighting, adding to the realism and perspective accuracy of the composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of both figures are depicted accurately with five fingers each. They demonstrate natural curvature and fluid lines. The figures' hands are not shown with extra digits or any noticeable distortion, maintaining anatomical correctness consistent with human hand structure.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the golden halos above both figures complete circles, evenly spaced from the head, and free from deformation or clipping into hair or garments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden halos are clearly depicted as complete circles and maintain an appropriate distance from the individuals’ heads. There is no obvious deformation or interaction with the garments or hair that would interrupt their intended design, maintaining an idealized depiction typical in religious imagery.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall scene reflects a fresco-like texture that is apparent through the nuanced use of brushstroke patterns and subdued color tones. There is a softness to the image consistent with fresco art styles, with no visible seams or sharp contrasts that might hint at digital alteration flaws.",
