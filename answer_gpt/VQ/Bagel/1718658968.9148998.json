      "question": "Are the wooden puzzle pieces covering the castle's exterior uniformly textured with natural oak and mahogany variations, showing no repeating patterns or artificial seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a wooden puzzle resembling a castle, with blocks made from different shades of wood, likely oak and mahogany. The pieces showcase natural wood grain patterns, which contribute to the texture variations. The pieces fit together in an interlocking manner typical of puzzle constructions. The texture of the blocks appears to be consistent with natural wood, and each piece reflects visible variations in wood grain, without any obvious repeating patterns or unnatural seams.",

      "question": "Do the towers, archway, and surrounding walls retain their original shape and proportions without any geometric distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wooden construction with distinct architectural features such as towers and an archway, all made from interlocking puzzle blocks. The structure maintains clear architectural coherence, with straight lines and evenly proportioned elements, typical for an accurately assembled puzzle. There is no evidence of distortion or misalignment; the geometric precision seen in the block design suggests the structure is stable and accurately constructed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the top edges of both towers composed of clearly interlocked wooden puzzle pieces with no gaps, floating fragments, or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the top edges of the towers built from puzzle pieces that fit snugly together. The interlocking nature ensures there are no visible gaps or loose fragments. The design follows the logic of a puzzle where pieces fit tightly by matching cut-outs to ensure cohesion. This visual indicates that the construction is correctly assembled and structurally sound without any disconnections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the castle resting on a smooth, continuous wooden surface that matches the wood type and finish of the puzzle pieces, with consistent lighting and shadow under the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle puzzle rests on a base that mirrors the type and finish of the wooden puzzle blocks. The surface appears consistent with the wood's natural qualities, engaging a smooth finish. The shadow under the base reacts realistically to the lighting, indicative of a stable interaction between the structure and its base. The surface continuity suggests shared material origin and finishes between the castle and its resting platform.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the reflections in the water and shadows beneath the castle show accurate interaction with the wooden surface, with no unnatural glare, color shifts, or floating reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals shadows below the wooden puzzle structure, but it does not include reflective surfaces like water, as seen in Image A. The wooden base exhibits typical shadow behavior on a solid wooden surface, solely reflecting consistent lighting conditions without any elements of water interactions. Given the consistent wood grain and lack of reflective surfaces in Image B, issues like unnatural glare or floating reflections do not pertain.",
