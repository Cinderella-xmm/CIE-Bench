      "question": "Are there any noticeable artifacts or breaks in the car's bodywork where the different views meet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image displays multiple views of the car, each isolated against a white background. The views appear separate, and there are no visible artifacts or breaks in the car's bodywork where these views meet, as each view is contained and independent. This suggests that the editing process maintained clean transitions between different perspectives.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do all views of the car maintain consistent material properties and lighting, avoiding unnatural differences?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When examining Image B, the car's surface and reflections appear consistent across all views. The finish of the car maintains similar glossiness and shine, implying that the material properties are unaltered. The lighting seems uniformly applied across all views, suggesting the edited image successfully avoided unnatural differences in material appearance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the car's geometry appear proportionally correct and undistorted across all views, particularly in the wheels and body panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the views in Image B, the car maintains its correct proportions and shape, including the wheels and body panels, in all perspectives. The images show no signs of distortion that would indicate editing errors. Therefore, the geometry appears proportionally accurate.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "In the top view, are the car's roofline and window outlines clear and detailed, without any loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top view of the car maintains clarity and detail in the roofline and window outlines. The details like window shapes and roof contours are visibly defined, indicating that fine details were preserved in this perspective.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the newly added views of the car integrate seamlessly with the background, without introducing any disruptive discontinuities or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car views are shown against a stark white background. Although the views are pasted over a uniform background, they do not need to integrate with a detailed background. This allows each view to be distinct without introducing inconsistencies. There are no disruptive elements or inconsistencies introduced, as they are isolated.",
