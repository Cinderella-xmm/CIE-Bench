      "question": "Are the metallic textures added to the camera body natural, maintaining the camera's structural coherence without visible artifacts or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic texture applied to the camera body transforms it into a steampunk-style image. The structural elements of the camera remain coherent but the details are stylized to fit the chosen theme, with visible textures replicating a metallic appearance common in steampunk design. This transformation tends to lose the realistic detail and coherence seen in Image A's actual camera structure, making it more artistic than natural.",

      "question": "Does the lens maintain its original proportions and geometric shape, with metallic textures that appear authentic and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the camera lens with a deliberate distortion to emphasize the steampunk aesthetic vibe. Although the lens shape is somewhat preserved, the added textures deviate from authentic portrayal, fitting an artistic style rather than keeping true to the physical realism of Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tripod legs and head display metallic textures that are consistent with their original structure, avoiding damage to geometry or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tripod in Image B is noticeably modified with emblematic steampunk metallic textures and details that differ from Image A's smooth, modern finish. Although it retains some structure from the original photograph, the artistic metallic additions project a more stylized look that doesn't strictly uphold the geometric integrity of the initial design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the Nikon logo and other text labels naturally integrated into the metallic design, remaining legible and consistent with the steampunk style without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'Niikon' logo and text in Image B adapt to the steampunk theme but appear altered and less coherent when compared with Image A's clear branding. While it tries to integrate into the visual theme, these alterations affect clarity and make it seem slightly out of place against the excessive steampunk style background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting, shadowing, and reflection on the camera and tripod consistent and realistic within the steampunk illustration style, contributing to the image's natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, lighting and shadows are manipulated to emphasize its steampunk illustration style, which means theyâ€™re less about real-world accuracy and more about enhancing the thematic look. Within the context of this particular stylistic approach, the lighting is consistent in terms of the artificial environment rather than photorealism seen in Image A.",
