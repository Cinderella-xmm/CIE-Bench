    "Question": "Q1: Does the LEGO version of the military ship maintain its original shape and structural proportions without visible distortions or misaligned brick patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model of the ship appears well-constructed, with a uniform shape and consistent brick patterns. There are no visible distortions, and the structural proportions seem accurate. This indicates that the LEGO representation maintains a cohesive structure, closely mimicking its real-world counterpart in terms of shape and proportion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the LEGO-rendered ocean waves shaped in a way that mimics natural wave motion, without appearing overly rigid or uniformly flat?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO ocean waves have a curved design with variations in height, mimicking natural wave patterns. These design elements help convey a sense of movement and natural randomness, avoiding a rigid or flat appearance. This suggests that the LEGO waves successfully mimic natural wave motion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the LEGO accessories used for the boat deck properly scaled and positioned to match the size and perspective of the character and the surrounding scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO accessories on the boat deck, such as small colored bricks and elements, appear properly scaled and appropriately positioned to fit the size and perspective of the LEGO ship model. The deck looks coherent and proportional within the context of the scene, indicating that the scaling and positioning are correct.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the LEGO-textured life vest and shirt retain their original colors and show no signs of unnatural texture repetition, pixelation, or mismatched edges?",
    "explanation": "This question is not applicable as Image B shows a LEGO ship and ocean model rather than a character wearing a life vest and shirt. Therefore, the assessment of clothing textures does not pertain to the provided visual content.",
    "answer": "No"
}

```json
{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO model positioned on a shelf that appears structurally sound and spatially coherent, with appropriate shadows and depth cues?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model is set on a shelf that appears structurally sound, evidenced by the straight lines and consistent surfaces of the shelf. The shadows and depth cues are appropriate, providing a realistic placement of the model in the three-dimensional space of the shelf.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

```json
{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, misaligned bricks, or missing pieces in the LEGO model that break the illusion of a cohesive construction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model appears complete and well-constructed. There are no visible artifacts like jagged lines, misaligned bricks, or missing pieces that would disrupt the illusion of a cohesive LEGO structure, suggesting a seamless and well-executed model.",
    "answer": "No"
}
