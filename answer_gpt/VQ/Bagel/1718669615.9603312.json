    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the spaceship retain a coherent circular shape with consistent proportions, and are the added circular motifs and meander patterns aligned symmetrically without warping or overlapping irregularly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in question is a pottery vessel with circular motifs and meander patterns. The vessel maintains a circular shape, as expected for the design of a traditional pot. The patterns on the pot are arranged in a symmetrical fashion, a typical design practice that ensures visual harmony. The shape and pattern alignments are executed without any warping or irregular overlaps, reflecting skilled artistry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the painted patterns on the spaceshipâ€™s surface free from digital artifacts, such as jagged edges, unnatural brushstroke textures, or inconsistent color gradients that suggest poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, featuring a pottery vessel, displays painted patterns that are smooth and consistent. This indicates a well-rendered image free from digital artifacts such as jagged edges or unnatural textures. The colors are consistent, with a clean precision that may be indicative of careful hand-painting or high-quality digital illustration.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the abstract wave forms in the landscape below continuous and smoothly curved, avoiding sharp breaks or abrupt transitions that disrupt the flow of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The landscape in Image B consists of abstract wave forms that serve as a base for the pottery vessel. These forms are continuously and smoothly curved, enhancing the overall aesthetics of the image. The absence of sharp transitions ensures the viewer experiences a harmonious visual flow, which aligns with common practices in abstract and decorative art.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the colors in the transformed landscape consist exclusively of muted earth tones (e.g., browns, tans, dark reds) without any bright or out-of-place colors like neon greens or electric blues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landscape accompanying the pottery vessel is composed of muted earth tones, such as browns, tans, and dark reds. These colors are typical in traditional pottery or ceramic designs. There are no bright or vibrant colors like neon greens or blues that would otherwise disrupt the earth tone scheme.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the edited spaceship positioned at a consistent altitude above the abstract landscape, with proper perspective alignment relative to the curved railway tracks below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a spaceship above railway tracks but rather a pottery vessel situated within an abstract design. The pot is centrally placed and appears consistent in perspective with the flowing, symmetrical wave forms below. While not depicting altitude, the alignment suggests careful placement ensuring a balanced composition between the object and the abstracted landscape.",
