      "question": "Are the details and textures of the skateboarder and the urban background preserved despite the application of the faded effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faded Polaroid effect and paper-like texture seem to have altered the clarity and sharpness of the image compared to Image A. The details and textures appear more vintage and less distinct due to the editing, suggesting a loss in the original sharpness of Image A. The background and skateboarder are less defined, which is a common result of this style effect.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the white border and text \"11:13 AM\" blend naturally into the image without introducing any visual distractions or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white border and text '11:13 AM' are part of the Polaroid effect that typically accompanies such edited images. These elements are consistent with the visual style of Polaroid photographs, contributing to the intended aesthetic rather than disrupting it. The effect is intentional and generally not distracting when considering the style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the paper-like grain texture applied uniformly across the image without causing noticeable loss of detail or introduction of unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a uniform paper-like grain texture typical of the Polaroid effect. This texture is consistent throughout the image, contributing to a vintage and retro aesthetic, though it may lead to overall detail loss regarding sharpness and definition. Nevertheless, it doesn't introduce uneven or unnatural patterns that would significantly detract from the image quality within the context of this style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical relationships between the skateboarder, the skateboard, and the background elements remain consistent and logical after applying the Polaroid effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the Polaroid effect and texture application, the proportions and physical relationships between the skateboarder, the skateboard, and the background elements remain the same as in Image A. The editing style impacts the visual clarity but does not alter the logical consistency of positioning and size relationships between these components.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the edges of the skateboarder and the skateboard smooth and free from any unnatural artifacts or distortions resulting from the editing process?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a vintage aesthetic due to the Polaroid effect and grain texture, which inherently softens edges and sometimes introduces roughness as part of its style. Upon examining, the edges of the skateboarder and skateboard are generally consistent with the style, though they may not be as smooth and free from artifacts as Image A due to the characteristic texture of the effect.",
