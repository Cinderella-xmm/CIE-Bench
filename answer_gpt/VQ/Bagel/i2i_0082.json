      "question": "Does the metallic texture of the badge appear natural without introducing any unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic part of the keychain in Image B is smooth and exhibits a realistic texture that reflects light appropriately, suggesting a metal surface. There are no visible artifacts or pixelations that usually indicate poor digital editing or rendering. The texture and reflection seem consistent with what is expected from a polished metal surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the circular frame of the clock/badge perfectly round, without any visible geometric distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular frame appears to be symmetrical and evenly rounded. The circle is smooth without any visible irregularities, kinks, or distortions, which would typically be noticeable if there were geometric issues.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the hour, minute, and second hands retain their original proportions and alignment, avoiding any distortion or misplacement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock hands in Image B are aligned to the center and maintain the traditional proportional lengths and straightness expected of clock hands. Their design and placement do not show any signs of distortion, deviation, or misalignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any inconsistent shadows or reflections on the metallic badge that contradict its physical placement as a keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows and reflections on the metallic badge in Image B are consistent with the light source from the top left, as deduced from the light reflections on the round metal frame. There are no conflicting shadows or reflections that suggest an unnatural placement or lighting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the border thickness and surface finish of the metallic badge consistent and detailed enough to maintain the image's overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The border thickness of the metallic badge in Image B is uniform throughout its perimeter, which is typically required for authenticity in product design. The surface finish, with its reflective quality, appears consistent with a polished metal item, contributing to the image's realistic and natural appearance.",
