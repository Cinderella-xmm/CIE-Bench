    "Question": "Q1: Are the body shapes of both elephants smoothly transformed into curved bottle forms without visible breaks or unnatural bends in their silhouettes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephants have been transformed into bottle-like shapes with smooth curves. The silhouettes are consistent with real bottle designs in terms of symmetry and smoothness. There are no abrupt or unnatural breaks in the appearance of these objects, indicating a well-designed transformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the elephant ears appear as gold-trimmed bottle caps with smooth edges and no misalignment or deformation compared to the rest of the structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle caps, representing elephant ears, are gold-trimmed and are circular, retaining alignment with the overall shape. The edges are smooth and integrate seamlessly into the bottle form, without any misalignment or deformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the glittering texture on the backs of the elephants replaced with a clear, evenly distributed glass mosaic pattern that reflects light naturally without artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The backs of the elephants in Image B show a mosaic pattern of glass, replacing the original glittered texture. The mosaic is evenly distributed across the surface and reflects light naturally, simulating real-world glass properties without visible artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the brand logo and fragrance name label clearly visible along the trunks without stretching, warping, or overlapping with other features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brand logo and fragrance name labels are displayed on the side of the bottles, resembling the elephant trunks. The labels are clear and readable without stretching, warping, or overlapping with other features, indicating careful placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the gold trim, glass mosaic patterns, and bottle surfaces exhibit consistent lighting and reflection behavior that aligns with real-world material properties?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates gold trim and glass mosaic patterns that interact with light consistently and naturally, mimicking real-world behavior. The reflection and highlighting on the bottle surfaces align with expected properties of these materials, ensuring a believable representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
