    "Question": "Q4: Is the transition between the skateboard, sink, and cabinets visually credible and coherent, without any noticeable breaks or inconsistencies in the stained glass style?",
    "explanation": "The visual transition between the skateboard, sink, and cabinets within Image B appears coherent and seamless. Each element retains its stained glass style, exhibiting bold outlines and distinct color partitions that are typical for stained glass design. The integration of these elements into a single cohesive scene, while maintaining the stained glass theme, indicates that the transitions are visually plausible and consistent with expected stained glass coherency.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the details of the objects, such as the skateboard wheels and cabinet handles, remain authentic and detailed within the stained glass style, avoiding any degradation of fine details?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard wheels and cabinet handles are represented within the stained glass style, maintaining their identifiable features and positions. Although the fine details are stylized to fit the stained glass theme—relying on simplified shapes and color contrast—the core details of these objects remain recognizable and integrated into the design without loss of authenticity. This approach ensures the preservation of essential details as adapted for stained glass artistry.",
