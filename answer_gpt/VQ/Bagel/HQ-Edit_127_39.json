    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the energy crown at the top of the Eiffel Tower symmetrically aligned with the tower’s central axis and does it cast consistent light without visible rendering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, we see a futuristic figure with an energy crown floating above it, which might cause confusion with the Eiffel Tower if not analyzed carefully. However, there is no Eiffel Tower present in Image B, so there is no alignment or light casting to evaluate in relation to the tower’s structure. The crown is part of a digital character design and is centered above the figure’s head, which might imply symmetry but does not relate to the Eiffel Tower.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the iron lattice girders of the Eiffel Tower preserved in their original geometric configuration, with no signs of bending, stretching, or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a digital figure with neon lines resembling circuits but does not contain any representations of the Eiffel Tower's lattice girders. The figure has a wireframe cape and other digital attributes, so there is no basis here to assess any preservation of the Eiffel Tower's geometric configuration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the luminescent circuits run continuously along the tower’s surface without floating above it, and do they emit light that blends naturally with the surrounding illumination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a digital character with luminescent circuits on its body. These circuits have a stylistic glow consistent with a digital theme, but they do not relate to the Eiffel Tower’s surface. They are intact on the character and appear to emit light fitting for the design, but this is not applicable to any Eiffel Tower surface.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the digital glyphs embedded into the girders without causing visible displacement or deformation of the metal structure beneath them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe patterns and luminescent designs on the digital character's outfit, resembling digital glyphs. However, there are no girders akin to the Eiffel Tower present in this image, so the question about embedding without causing deformation is not applicable here.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the holographic elements appear translucent and layered with depth, and do they avoid intersecting solid parts of the tower or showing pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a digital character design with holographic elements represented by the glowing areas and circuits. These elements appear translucent and layered and avoid intersecting solid parts, fitting within the design of the character rather than any tower structure. Therefore, the holographic analysis pertains solely to the character design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the pixelated energy barriers positioned directly around the base of the tower and do they have sharp, consistent edges without blurring or floating above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces the Eiffel Tower with a digital figure that has pixelated energy elements surrounding it, not a base of the tower. These electronic features form a distinct circular pattern with a sense of depth but are part of the character, not an architectural structure like the base of a tower. Therefore, the question does not apply to what is seen in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the digital eyes located in a position consistent with the tower’s architecture and do they emit light that casts soft shadows and reflects off adjacent surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital character possesses glowing eyes that emit light as expected in a digital construct. However, these eyes are not integrated into architecture comparable to the Eiffel Tower, as they are features of the character's design. The emitted light reflects in a way that suits the thematic digital style but is unrelated to any architectural considerations.",
