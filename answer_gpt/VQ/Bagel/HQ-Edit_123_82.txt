    "Question": "Q5: Are the months displayed on the wings clearly legible, properly aligned, and integrated into the wing design without disrupting the wing’s shape or causing visual conflicts such as overlapping or floating text?",
    "explanation": "Image B, in fact, does not display any months on the butterfly wings, indicating a misunderstanding in the question context or visual interpretation. Consequently, issues like text alignment, visual conflicts, or disruptions do not arise as there's no text to interact with the wing's design.",
    "answer": "No"
