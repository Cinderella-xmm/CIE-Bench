      "question": "Do the muscles and body proportions of the basketball player appear exaggerated but still maintain anatomical plausibility without unnatural bulges or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basketball player is illustrated in a way that emphasizes certain features such as muscular definition and pose typical of stylized art, such as graffiti. The limbs are toned but maintain plausible proportions, closely following human anatomy in their exaggerated form without any breaks or bulges, indicating that despite exaggeration, anatomical plausibility is retained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors applied to the player's clothing and skin consistent with the graffiti theme and do they retain visible texture and material properties without appearing flat or artificially oversaturated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses vivid, bright colors typical of graffiti art. The player's clothing and skin follow this theme well, with saturated colors that enhance the stylized effect yet do not appear flat. Despite the exaggerated colors, textures are visible for both the clothing and skin, consistent with material properties as perceived in stylized illustrations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the basketball have exactly five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and does it grip the ball in a physically credible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player's hand is illustrated holding the basketball. The fingers are clearly depicted, all five visibly separated with a natural curve that mimics a realistic grip. This attention to detail ensures the grip maintains physical credibility, consistent with how hands typically hold a basketball.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blank graffiti-style text area clearly visible, stylistically consistent with the background graffiti, and placed in a way that does not distort the scene or obscure key elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text area in Image B, in graffiti-style, is visibly integrated into the composition, matching the artistic theme of the background.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates consistent lighting and shadows for the player and basketball, aligned with the stylized art while respecting the graffiti aesthetic.
