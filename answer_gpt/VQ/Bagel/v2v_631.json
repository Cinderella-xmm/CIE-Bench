      "question": "Does the character's face retain its natural proportions and features without any visible distortion or unnatural textures after being rendered in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the cartoon style in Image B, the face region shows consistent proportions typical of 3D character rendering, with features that align with common 3D aesthetics. These graphics typically aim for a streamlined appearance without visible distortions or clashing textures, adhering to the expected norms of cartoon development.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the character's purple hair depicted with smooth, consistent shading and texture that matches the 3D cartoon style without any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the purple hair is analyzed to have smooth shading consistent with 3D styles. This cartoon style often involves a simplified yet texturally rich presentation, with consistent gradients to simulate realistic lighting and movement. The lack of visible artifacts indicates effective rendering in the character's hair.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the character's black outfit maintain its structural integrity and material appearance, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or loss of fine details in the 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character's black outfit as having smooth contours and consistent appearance; 3D modeling in such renderings typically avoids broken shapes or geometric distortions, ensuring the outfit looks intact with well-defined material simulation, characteristic of digital renderings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the programmer-related tools or icons, such as code fragments or keyboards, integrated into the artwork in a way that complements the character and background without introducing any visual inconsistencies or unnatural placements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features 'Coding Ceadny' with integrated elements such as stats resembling code fragments. The seamless integration of such elements into the character card implies a complementary design choice between thematic coding elements and aesthetics, avoiding visual inconsistencies typically found in poorly rendered graphics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the title banner and nameplate feature crisp, polished borders that match the purple and black color scheme, contributing to the visual coherence of the character card without any distracting or inconsistent elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The borders in the title banner and nameplate of Image B are polished, enhancing the purple and black color theme consistent across the card. This design continuity contributes to the card's overall aesthetic coherence, aligning with professional graphic design standards where distracting elements would undermine the visual integrity.",
