      "question": "Is the elephant's size reduced proportionally so that its limbs, head, and body maintain correct relative proportions and do not appear stretched or compressed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant appears smaller than in Image A, and its proportions are analyzed. The limbs, head, and body of the elephant maintain the same relative proportions as the larger version in Image A. By observing the symmetry and natural appearance of the elephant's features, it is evident that the resizing process was done without stretching or compressing any part of the body, preserving the relative proportions accurately. The visual information indicates consistency in structure and form.",

      "question": "Do the golden inlays follow the contours and patterns of the original wood carvings without creating abrupt edges or mismatched material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden inlays are observed to accentuate the patterns present on the elephant. They integrate seamlessly with the existing carvings, implying expertise in design continuity. The transition between gold and wood is smooth, without abrupt edges, indicating an adept application that respects the original contours of the carvings. This is assessed by visually following the flow of patterns and noting the uniformity in their composition.",

      "question": "Are the bonsai trees positioned at a scale consistent with the miniaturized elephant and do they exhibit natural leaf shapes, branch structures, and ground-level placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bonsai trees in Image B appear consistent with the scale of the miniaturized elephant. They are positioned around the elephant in a way that suggests a natural setting. The leaf shapes and branch structures of the bonsai trees are intricate and reflective of real-world botanical forms. The placement of the bonsai trees at the ground level is harmonious with the context of the image, further suggesting that they are intended to be a natural background.",
