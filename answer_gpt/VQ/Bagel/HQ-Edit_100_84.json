      "question": "Are the added decorative patterns on the dhowâ€™s hull and deck aligned with the wood grain and structural lines, and do they lack jagged edges or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dhow features intricate decorative patterns on its hull and deck, primarily in blue and gold tones. These patterns seem well-aligned with the structure of the dhow, flowing naturally along its lines without appearing out of place. The smoothness of the patterns indicates that there are no jagged edges or unnatural textures visible. These attributes are indicative of careful editing, ensuring that the design complements the existing features of the dhow and maintains a cohesive appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the mythical sea creatures near the dhow have smooth contours, realistic scales or skin textures, and proper interaction with the water surface (e.g., ripples, reflections)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sea creatures depicted in Image B alongside the dhow are illustrated in an artistic manner, featuring smooth contours and stylized blue tones. However, their design leans more towards a decorative, illustrative style rather than aiming for realism. There is no significant interaction with the water surface, such as visible ripples or reflections, suggesting that the focus was more on decorative aesthetics rather than achieving realistic textures or interactions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the blue and gold tones applied consistently across the scene without causing color bleeding, pixelation, or loss of detail in shaded areas of the boat and water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue and gold tones are predominantly used, particularly on the dhow and in the surrounding graphical elements. The application appears consistent, with smooth transitions and well-defined areas of color. There are no signs of color bleeding or pixelation. Although the image is stylized, shaded areas on the boat maintain detail without significant loss. This indicates that the editing involved a careful application of colors, ensuring clarity and consistency throughout the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the distant sailboats rendered as dark, simplified shapes that maintain their boat-like outline and do not merge into the sky or water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, distant sailboats are depicted as simplified shapes, relying on silhouette-like representations to suggest their form. These silhouettes maintain a boat-like appearance without fusing into the sky or water, thus preserving the distinctness of each element in the composition. This suggests a deliberate choice in graphic style to keep distant elements clean and distinct, aligning with the stylized nature of the overall image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the Arabian skyline mirage at the horizon rendered with a soft, shimmering effect that blends with the sky and water, and does it display geometric patterns without sharp edges or solid blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an Arabian skyline appears at the horizon, characterized by a stylized geometric form. The skyline is integrated with the sky and water, presented without sharp edges or distinct solid blocks. The rendering suggests a visual intent to blend the shapes softly into the background, using atmospheric blending or mirage effects. This technique enhances the dreamlike or fantastical quality of the scene, consistent with the artistic direction of the image.",
