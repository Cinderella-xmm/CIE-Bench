      "question": "Do the arm-like appendages formed from the balconies maintain consistent proportions and smooth joints without jagged edges or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robotic structure consists of arm-like appendages that are formed by the modular blocks which mimic balconies. These appendages show consistent proportions as they resemble a robot's articulated arms with distinct elbow and shoulder joints. The structure maintains smooth lines and does not exhibit any jagged edges or unnatural bends, reflecting an understanding of machinery assembly where components fit together neatly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glowing panels uniformly distributed across the window positions and do they emit light in a way that blends seamlessly with the surrounding surfaces without harsh halos or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing panels in Image B are distributed at regular intervals, emulating the windows of a building but functioning as light emitters. The light appears evenly distributed and integrated with the surfaces, without noticeable harsh halos or pixelation. The uniformity in light emission suggests an understanding of consistent lighting in design, ensuring the glow enhances the structure rather than causing any visual disturbance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the circuit patterns run along plausible structural lines (e.g., edges, corners) and exhibit consistent thickness and color without appearing as random overlays or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features circuit-like patterns that are integrated into the design, primarily following structural lines along the edges and corners of the modules. These patterns display consistent thickness and color, making them appear as intentional design elements rather than random overlays. This coherence reflects a mechanical design logic where circuit patterns enhance structural emphasis and aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dynamic parts at the edges of the building connected to the main structure through visible mechanical links, and do they follow realistic pivot points without floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot-like appendages show dynamic parts connected to the main structure through visible mechanical joints, such as elbows and shoulders. These connections follow realistic pivot points typical in jointed mechanics, and there is no evidence of floating or misaligned components. The attention to detail in these joints suggests an understanding of how mechanical bodies articulate.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the exposed gears positioned at structural junctions and scaled appropriately relative to the buildingâ€™s height and width, without appearing oversized or misaligned with surrounding features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there aren't any visible exposed gears that disrupt the cohesiveness of the building structure. The features are instead focused on blocky designs that resemble robotic parts. Without visible gears, there cannot be any oversized or misaligned components in this context, ensuring a harmonious alignment with the robot-like appearance.",
