    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the steps now display a series of uniformly sized, overlapping scale-like segments that follow the spiral path without visible gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the staircase steps are transformed into scale-like segments. The scales are consistently overlapping and aligned with each other along the spiral path, creating a visually uniform appearance without gaps or misalignment. Common knowledge of scale structures corroborates the observation that these are seamlessly integrated.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the railing now form a continuous, gently curving spine-like structure with consistent thickness and no abrupt changes in direction or width?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a transformation where the railing forms a spine-like configuration, aligning with expectations for vertebrate design. The spine-like structure visibly maintains consistent thickness and curvature throughout the spiral path, without any abrupt changes indicative of uniformity often found in natural spine formations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wooden patterns applied to the spine consistent in tone, grain, and texture with the original railing, and do they appear as an integral part of the structure rather than a separate overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the railing is wooden. In Image B, the spine-like structure does not appear to have a wooden pattern but rather resembles a textured scale structure. Therefore, it lacks consistency with the original wooden patterns in tone, grain, or texture. This indicates that the design in Image B is separate from the wooden texture seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the stone-like ridges aligned along the outer edge of the spiral coils and smoothly integrated into the surface, without appearing detached or misaligned with the underlying form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, stone-like ridges are integrated into the scale-like surface of the spiral. They are smoothly aligned along the outer edge of the spiral, maintaining cohesion with the overall form and contributing to the seamless design without appearing detached or misaligned.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the spiral coils decrease in size proportionally toward the center, maintaining smooth curvature and even spacing without compression or stretching that distorts the spiral shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the spiral coils indeed decrease in size proportionally toward the center. The transformation maintains smooth curvature and consistent spacing, preserving the integrity of the spiral shape without noticeable distortion through compression or stretching.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do shadows and highlights on the scales, spine, and ridges follow the contours of the new surface structure, matching the direction and intensity of ambient light from above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, shadows and highlights effectively follow the contours of the scales, spine, and ridges. The lighting appears consistent with ambient light coming from above, with shadows cast in expected places and highlights enhancing the texture and depth of the new form, demonstrating appropriate shadow and light direction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the edges of the scale segments, spinal bones, and stone ridges clearly defined and free from blurring, aliasing, or stair-stepping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, edges are sharply defined without visible blurring, aliasing, or stair-stepping artifacts. The scales, spinal formation, and ridges exhibit crisp edge quality, ensuring the transformation maintains clarity throughout the new design.",
