      "question": "Does the basketball motif on Patrick’s shirt appear seamlessly integrated with the fabric texture, without visible seams, jagged edges, or unnatural color blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Patrick’s shirt features a rectangular print resembling a SpongeBob costume rather than a basketball motif. It has clear outlines and is brightly colored, indicating it is not seamlessly integrated with the fabric texture. There appear to be clear edges and mismatched styles, which suggests issues with color blending and integration.",

      "question": "Are SpongeBob’s sneakers proportionally accurate and do they feature a clear, consistent cereal loop pattern without distortion or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, SpongeBob’s sneakers are stylized and seem a bit exaggerated, fitting the cartoonish style. The cereal loop pattern on the sneakers is inconsistent with patches reminiscent of various colors like green and yellow. There is noticeable decoration but without specifying a cereal loop pattern. The design does not clearly resemble any uniform pattern related to cereal hoops.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cereal hoops surrounding the characters have consistent circular shapes, appropriate size relative to the figures, and realistic lighting and shadowing that match the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows basketballs around the characters, resembling cereal hoops if intended as part of a theme. They are depicted as uniformly round and appropriately sized, with consistent and expected lighting and shadowing in an animated context, thereby maintaining continuity within the cartoon style.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the urban sports background with graffiti elements stylistically consistent with the characters and free from obvious texture mismatches, such as sharp edges, incorrect lighting, or unnatural surface details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B has graffiti elements typical in urban settings, compatible with the cartoon style of SpongeBob and Patrick. The edges, lighting, and surface details do not showcase obvious mismatches. The entire design aligns with animated art, making it appear consistent and integrated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title “Basketball Breakfast Blitz!” clearly readable, properly aligned at the top of the image, and free from blurring, shadow artifacts, or overlapping with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title, while appearing like 'Basketball Breskanst Blitz!' (likely a creative twist or error), is positioned at the top within a clearly defined rectangular yellow space. It is readable without overlap or noticeable blur or shadow artifacts, aligning with the thematic content of the packaging.",
