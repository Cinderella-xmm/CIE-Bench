      "question": "Does the line-art transformation of the person's pose retain the natural positioning of the raised hand, open mouth, and camera without introducing unnatural textures or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a line-art illustration where the person's pose, including the raised hand, open mouth, and the camera in front of the face, is depicted with clear and consistent line work. The positions of these elements are accurately carried over from the original image, indicating the transformation retains the natural positioning without distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the raised hand, open mouth, and camera covering part of the face preserved in a way that maintains their structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the line-art style effectively captures the raised hand, open mouth, and camera, maintaining the shapes and positions seen in the original image. This consistency in illustration ensures that these elements are structurally intact and visually credible in the edited version.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the added speech bubble with the text “Take a photo” integrate naturally into the image without introducing any obvious artifacts or disrupting the scene's realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble in Image B is a typical stylistic addition to cartoons, fitting naturally with the line-art style. Its placement near the person's head and simple bubble design integrate well with the overall illustration, enhancing the narrative without disrupting realism or introducing artifacts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details, such as the texture of the bathroom and the person’s clothing, been preserved without loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a simplified line-art style, which inherently reduces detail compared to the original photographic texture seen in Image A. Consequently, the cartoon form does not preserve the fine details and textures of the bathroom or clothing from the original image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cartoon line-art transformation maintain the realistic proportions and shapes of the person and objects, avoiding any distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the abstraction to line art, the proportions and shapes of the person and objects, including the raised hand and camera, are accurately represented. They maintain realism in terms of size and form, avoiding distortion or exaggerated geometric shapes typical in some cartoon styles.",
