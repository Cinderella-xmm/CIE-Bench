    "Question": "Q1: Does the surface of the teapot’s body exhibit a consistent, smooth high-gloss ceramic finish without visible texture artifacts or abrupt transitions from the original metallic look?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a white cylindrical object with a surface that does not suggest a high-gloss ceramic finish; instead, it has characteristics more akin to a candle, as suggested by its cylindrical form and wick at the top. There are textured floral patterns engraved on the lower portion of this object, and no signs indicate a ceramic finish nor a transition from metallic to ceramic appearance. The absence of glossy texture on the surface confirms the answer.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the wick positioned at the tip of the former spout location in a straight, vertical orientation that aligns naturally with the candle design, without bending or deformation?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a wick at the top of the cylindrical object, which aligns vertically and fits naturally with the design of a candle. There are no visual cues indicating bending or deformation of the wick; the wick stands upright, typical of candle wicks. This vertical position is consistent with the common placement of wicks in candles, suggesting a natural integration into the object’s design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the handle now rendered as a solid gold-colored accent with no visible remnants of the original wood or metal, and does it retain its original curvature without warping or unnatural thickness changes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the handle of the candle is gold-colored and maintains an elegant curve, consistent with luxury products. There is no visible appearance of wood or metal remnants; the entire handle is uniformly gold in color. The curvature appears consistent and fluid without any evident distortions, thickness changes, or warping. The design resonates well with what is observed in luxury candle holders, confirming the description and condition of the handle.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the floral patterns around the base of the teapot evenly spaced, proportionally scaled, and stylistically consistent with the existing engraved motifs, without overlapping or distorting the base structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a cylindrical object with floral patterns toward the lower section, intended to complement the luxury theme of this candle. These patterns are evenly spaced and stylistically fit with the base structure without overlapping or distorting the cylindrical form. The consistent integration of these patterns with the candle suggests thoughtful design, aligning proportional scaling and spacing with the object’s aesthetic cohesion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the text 'Eternal Elegance Candle' placed centrally on the front face of the teapot in a flowing script font that matches the luxury theme, with no pixelation, shadowing, or clipping artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Eternal Elegance Candde' (likely a typo) is centered on the front face of the cylindrical candle and presented in a flowing script font that aligns with luxury themes. The placement and font style match luxury product branding, enhancing the elegant aesthetic. There is no pixelation, shadowing, or clipping observed, indicating that the text is cleanly integrated into the design of the candle.",
