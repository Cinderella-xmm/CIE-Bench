      "question": "Do the tesserae on the chest and torso follow the original armorâ€™s curves without visible breaks, misalignments, or inconsistent tile sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts a mosaic representation of the original image. Tesserae, small tiles used in mosaics, should ideally follow the contours of the original design. Upon examining the edited image, the tiles on the chest and torso appear to follow the curves without visible misalignments or breaks. The transition between tiles seems fluid, maintaining consistent sizing without abrupt changes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the left and right wings symmetrically styled with ornate feathers, and do they maintain natural layering and curvature without unnatural bends or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in the edited image are depicted with mosaic tiles aiming to represent feathers. On observing the image, both wings are symmetrically styled, and the ornate feather details preserve natural layering and curvature. There are no signs of unnatural bends or gaps between the tiles that would disrupt symmetry.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the celestial dome background appear to surround the figure without visible edges, color bleeding, or inconsistencies in lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in the edited image is a depiction of a celestial dome using mosaic tiles. Upon analyzing the image, the dome appears to encapsulate the main figure without any visible edges. The lighting direction is consistent, without any sign of color bleeding or inconsistencies that would suggest poor integration of the background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mosaic patterns on the crown and neckpiece aligned with the original shape, symmetrically placed, and free of distorted or missing sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image is styled with mosaic tiles, and the areas covering the crown and neckpiece retain the original shape and symmetry with clearly defined patterns. The mosaic is appropriately aligned, without noticeable distortions or missing sections, reflecting a coherent and precise arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the gold and azure colors used consistently across the armor, wings, and crown, with matching reflectivity and no abrupt transitions between materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uses a color palette primarily consisting of gold and azure to depict various elements. These colors are applied consistently across the armor, wings, and crown. The choice of mosaic tiles ensures that the reflectivity maintains a uniform appearance, without abrupt transitions that may suggest inconsistencies between materials.",
