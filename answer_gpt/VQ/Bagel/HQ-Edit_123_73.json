    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the pyramid’s steps transformed into armored segments with consistent thickness, alignment, and geometric integrity, without visible breaks or unnatural warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pyramid’s steps are transformed into structured, armory-like segments which appear uniformly carved with consistent thickness and alignment. The segments maintain geometric integrity, seamlessly aligned without visible breaks or unnatural warping. This is likely design consistency with pyramid architecture, showing a smooth transformation into a different visual style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the entrance at the top of the pyramid replaced with an eye-like structure that matches the stone material and scale, without abrupt texture changes or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an eye-like structure replaces the top entrance, maintaining the stone material qualities and scale suitable to the structure. The integration is smooth without abrupt texture change or floating parts, suggesting careful editing that aligns with the original material's properties.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trees and foliage surrounding the pyramid transform into vine-like scales that follow natural growth patterns and maintain consistent texture and lighting, without unnatural sharp edges or disconnected patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays vine-like elements surrounding the pyramid, illustrating a transformation from standard trees to vines. These vines are shown to follow natural, spiraling growth patterns consistent with known botanic behavior. Textures and lighting on these vines are consistent across the image, without sharp edges or disconnected patches, reflecting realistic growth and integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are ancient stone patterns preserved and integrated into the base of the pyramid-creature, maintaining continuity with original carvings and avoiding mismatched or floating decorative elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, patterns on the base of the pyramid appear carefully integrated, maintaining visual continuity with imagined ancient stone carvings usually known in such contexts. There's no evidence of design mismatches or floating decorations, ensuring a harmonious integration with expected architectural motifs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the luminescent plants around the base emit soft, localized light that interacts realistically with the environment, without overexposed areas or unnatural color spillage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of luminescent plants in Image B shows them emitting light with a soft and localized glow that interacts credibly with the surrounding environment. The lighting effects are well-integrated, avoiding overexposure or unnatural color spilling, thus creating a believable, atmospheric effect.",
