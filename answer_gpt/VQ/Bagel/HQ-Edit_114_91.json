      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the ivy formations on the hammerhead shaped like symmetrical, watchful eyes with natural leaf arrangement and no visible digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer's appearance is dramatically altered compared to a simple rusted tool in Image A. The hammer in Image B is presented with digital modifications, including luminous green patterns. These do not naturally resemble ivy or leaf arrangements but seem more fantastical, as evidenced by the glow and stylistic eyes typical of digital art rather than natural formation. Therefore, the ivy formations do not look like natural leaf arrangements due to these digital alterations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss-covered bark texture cover the hammer and anvil uniformly without abrupt color shifts, patchy areas, or synthetic-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer and anvil are stylized to appear as part of a vibrant, fantastical world, unlike the rusty and earthy real objects in Image A. The texture on the anvil in Image B is consistent with stylized digital moss and bark, with fantasy elements and bright colors. While uniform in its digitally artistic style, it doesn't resemble natural moss covering due to its bright luminescence and fantastical design. Some areas of the pattern might appear synthetic due to the digital rendering.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the root-like structures beneath the anvil extend downward from the base in a way that mimics real tree roots, with tapering thickness and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structures extending from the anvil are digitally altered to have an organic feel, with luxurious artistry, resembling roots that taper naturally at the ends. However, their appearance is stylized with bright colors and doesn't completely mimic real tree roots' irregular organic forms since there can be a floating or synthetic feel from the digital art styling.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the emerald runes integrated into the bark surface such that they appear carved in, with subtle glow that blends into the surrounding texture and does not cause bright outlines or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases an intricately altered environment with runes that appear carved into what looks like bark, with a green glow. The glow is quite bright, which contrasts with the bark texture, possibly causing bright outlines and a stylized appearance common in fantasy digital art. These characteristics suggest the presence of visible digital artifacts, detracting from subtlety in blending.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the ivy tendrils follow logical climbing paths from the window frame and floor, wrapping around the hammer and anvil without crossing through solid parts or appearing suspended in mid-air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tendrils and ivy are part of a fantastical design. Unlike Image A, where tendrils logically wrap around objects, the vitality and suspension common in fantasy-themed images can cause unnatural paths in Image B. Hence, while they may follow a logical climbing path visually, they are instead depicted in a way that may ignore physical logic, typical for digital fantasy artworks.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the transformed anvil and hammer fall consistently with the light source from the window, and do they interact naturally with the wooden table and surrounding tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a surreal setting where the direction of light sources and shadows might deviate from natural logic, as opposed to Image A where sunlight is more naturally depicted. The fantastical depiction often allows for creative liberties that prioritize artistic effect over realistic shadow casting. This can lead to inconsistencies with shadow interaction compared to direct window lighting found in real-world scenarios.",
