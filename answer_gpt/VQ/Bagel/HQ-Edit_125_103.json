      "question": "Does the transformed teapot maintain a uniform cylindrical shape with smooth, continuous surfaces and no visible geometric distortions or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object, presumably the teapot, is characterized by a cylindrical tin container, which indeed has a smooth, continuous surface devoid of any apparent geometric distortions or irregularities. This evokes a uniform cylindrical shape, which is consistent with design expectations for such a container. Hence, the depiction is in line with the common structural expectations of a cylindrical object.",

      "question": "Are the golden foil floral patterns clearly embossed with consistent depth, proper lighting interaction, and no signs of blurred edges or artificial textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the golden foil features designs on the cylindrical container which appear to be floral patterns. These designs exhibit a level of depth and lighting interaction that is typical of embossed patterns, with clarity and no noticeable signs of blurring or artificial textures. This suggests that the embossing is executed with precision and visual consistency.",

      "question": "Are the redesigned cups stacked in a stable, physically plausible manner with matching rim sizes and lids that fit securely without gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image reveals multiple stacks of cups with lids that are carefully placed on top of each other. The rims of the cups appear aligned and consistent in size, and the lids fit atop each stack without visible gaps or misalignment, implying stability and physical plausibility in their arrangement.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Japanese calligraphy positioned at the top of the packaging with natural brushstroke variation and clear legibility, without clipping or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Japanese calligraphy is prominently displayed on the cylindrical container, potentially near the top as per the design layout. The calligraphy features natural brushstroke variations indicative of traditional style, and the characters are clearly legible, without any evidence of clipping or distortion, indicating a well-executed typography.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bamboo motif along the side have consistent node spacing, natural grain texture, and smooth edges without repeating or distorted segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a decorative bamboo motif featured on the side of the cylindrical container. The motifâ€™s design displays consistent node spacing and grain texture which mimics a natural appearance. Additionally, the edges of the motif appear smooth, with no signs of repeating patterns or distortion, contributing to an authentic visual representation.",

      "question": "Is the surface beneath the tea set completely flat, uniformly white, and free from any unintended shadows, textures, or reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base under the tea set in Image B is a flat, white surface. It appears smooth and consistent without visible shadows, texture variances, or reflections, providing a clean and uniform backdrop that enhances the visibility of the objects positioned upon it.",
