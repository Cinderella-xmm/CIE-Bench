      "question": "Are the eyes of the woman and child enlarged but still aligned with their facial structures without visible distortion or unnatural spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hands of the woman and child show five fingers each, with natural finger curvature and no overlapping or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, both the woman and child's hands are depicted with five fingers each. The fingers are drawn with proper curvature reflecting a typical hand structure in illustrations, and there is no evidence of overlapping or missing digits.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the color transitions across the woman’s dress, the child’s dress, and the background flowers smooth and free of sharp digital edges or unnatural blotches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between colors on the dresses and flowers can be observed to be smooth due to the watercolor style used. This style inherently provides a soft gradient with gradual color changes, avoiding sharp edges or blotches, which is consistent with the artistic approach.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the added floral accents in the background consistent in size, lighting, and texture with the existing flowers and do they cast plausible shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral accents in the edited image appear consistent in size and style with the overall illustration motif. While cartoon illustrations often simplify shadow effects, the lighting and texture harmonize with the artwork, maintaining a natural artistic coherence without implausible shadow casting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the wooden border have uniform thickness, natural wood grain, and proper alignment with the image edges without gaps or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden border surrounding the picture is consistently thick on all sides and contains visible wood grain pattern typical for wood textures. It aligns well with the edges of the image without showing gaps or deformation, reflecting skilled craftsmanship in digital art.",
