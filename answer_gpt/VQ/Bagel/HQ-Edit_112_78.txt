    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass container display natural transparency with visible embossed patterns that do not appear distorted or unnaturally stretched?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass container clearly shows transparency and features embossed patterns. The patterns appear crisp, clear, and uniformly distributed over the surface without any signs of distortion or unnatural stretching. The visual cues indicate careful attention to maintaining proportional consistency in design, relying on world knowledge of how glass containers typically display patterns.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the candle snuffer finial proportionally aligned with the glass container and structurally connected without gaps or floating elements?",
    "explanation": "The finial atop the container in Image B appears properly placed and seamlessly connected to the top of the glass container. Its proportions are consistent with the scale of the container, and visual cues show no gaps or floating elements, suggesting a natural attachment. This reflects world knowledge of how finials are typically designed to fit containers.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Does the marble base show consistent veining and reflective surface without any remnants of lace texture or unnatural seams?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the marble base displays consistent veining typical of marble surfaces, without any lace texture or seams. The reflective surface aligns with world knowledge of marble's natural characteristics, demonstrating careful attention to maintaining a realistic representation of the material.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the nameplate attached to the side of the container at a natural height and angle, with no floating or clipping artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The nameplate on the container in Image B is positioned at a realistic and natural height and angle. The image demonstrates careful attention to details, without any floating appearance or clipping artifacts, ensuring the nameplate is visually integrated into the design, based on world knowledge of nameplate attachment characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the reflections and shadows on the glass container, marble base, and finial align with the direction of the light source and exhibit consistent material behavior?",
    "explanation": "The reflections and shadows in Image B appear consistent and aligned with the direction of the light source. The glass container casts accurate reflections and shadows appropriate to its materials, while the marble base has congruent shadow behavior with its reflective properties, and the finial shows alignment matching the light source orientation. This consistency suggests a realistic portrayal based on world knowledge of material behaviors under lighting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
