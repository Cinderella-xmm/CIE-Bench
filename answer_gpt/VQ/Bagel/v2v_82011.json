      "question": "Do the bold calligraphic outlines and flat planes of color on the dolls' clothing and hair maintain the original proportions and positions without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls are represented with bold calligraphic outlines and flat planes of color, characteristic of the Ukiyo-e style. These stylistic elements are designed to maintain the original proportions and positions of the dolls as seen in Image A, which is a typical representation of a toy store with dolls. The outfits and hair in the edited image are aligned with the traditional, non-dimensional Japanese art style that focuses on maintaining harmony and balance without distorting proportions unnaturally.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the dolls' skin and hair free from unnatural artifacts and maintain a natural appearance after the style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a flat color plane which simplifies the texture of the skin and hair to suit the Ukiyo-e style. This style traditionally foregoes detailed textures for a more stylized and aesthetic appearance. Comparing to Image A, where the skin and hair have a realistic texture, Image B's transformations are consistent with Ukiyo-e conventions and do not introduce unnatural artifacts that deviate from this style.",

      "question": "Do the dolls' limbs and facial features retain their structural integrity and do not appear deformed after the style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the dolls maintain their structural integrity, including their limbs and overall form, in a manner that suits the Ukiyo-e art style which includes simplified and exaggerated forms that maintain the essence of the original subject. While the style reduces dimensionality, it does not imply deformation beyond the expected scope of stylization. Compared to the original Image A, the positioning and structure of the dollsâ€™ limbs remain coherent and intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the subtly patterned, simplified background complement the dolls without disrupting the visual flow and maintaining the overall sense of reality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background adopts a simplified pattern typical of traditional Japanese art, focusing on complementing rather than distracting from the primary subjects, the dolls. This stylization aligns with Ukiyo-e principles, which aim for aesthetic completeness by integrating soft, less-detailed backgrounds that enhance focal subjects. Image A features detailed backgrounds typical of a retail environment, which in Image B is transformed into a coherent part of the new style without disrupting the visual flow.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dolls' poses and expressions remain coherent with the original scene and contribute to the visual credibility of the Ukiyo-e style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B retains the original poses and expressions of the dolls found in Image A. These poses are characteristic and fitting within the Ukiyo-e style, which often depicts subjects in natural, yet stylized states. The coherence and retention of these poses help maintain visual credibility. Image A shows dolls in playful poses that translate effectively into the Ukiyo-e art style of Image B, preserving the artistic integrity while adapting to a different visual narrative.",
