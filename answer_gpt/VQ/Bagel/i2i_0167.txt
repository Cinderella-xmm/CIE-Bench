    "Question": "Q1: Does the front view of the apple maintain its original texture and color without any noticeable artifacts or unnatural smoothing?",
    "explanation": "Image B's front view of the apple exhibits a vibrant red color, realistic reflections and shadows, and surface textures appropriate for an apple. This suggests that the apple retains its natural texture and color without artificial enhancements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the cross-section reveal a natural, detailed texture of the apple's flesh, avoiding any unnatural or overly smooth appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cross-section of the apple shows the internal texture and details that one would expect from a cut apple, including variations in grain and color where the flesh meets the seed area. There are no signs of artificial smoothing or textural anomalies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the top view of the appleâ€™s stem and calyx accurately represented with natural proportions and geometry, without any obvious distortions or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The top view in Image B features a stem and calyx that appear well-proportioned and naturally corresponding to the shape and size of the apple. Adequate shading and angles are present, reflecting realistic geometry without distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the shapes, sizes, and textures of the apple consistent across the front view, cross-section, and top view, ensuring structural coherence without any contradictions?",
    "explanation": "Image B maintains consistency in the appearance of the apple across different views. The surface texture, color, and proportions are coherent between the front view, the cross-section, and the top view, demonstrating structural integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the lighting and shadows in the cross-section and top view appear natural and consistent with those in the front view, contributing to a unified appearance?",
    "explanation": "The lighting and shadowing in Image B are harmonious across the various views of the apple. Both the external and internal views show consistent light sources and shadow patterns, creating a natural and unified overall appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
