      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the badge maintain the same level of detail and texture as the vibrant domes and intricate patterns of the building, avoiding unnatural textures or loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the badge features a simplified representation of the building with cartoon-like design elements. The domes and patterns are stylized, lacking intricate detailing and texture compared to real architectural features, resulting in a loss of detail. This reflects a deliberate choice for simplicity rather than an attempt to replicate the complexity seen in the building's domes and patterns. Therefore informed by these observations combined with basic design concepts, Image B does not maintain the original level of detail and texture seen in the building.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes and proportions of the badge consistent with the architectural style of the building, ensuring no distortion or breakage of shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge depicts the building with simplified geometric shapes. The domes are represented in a clear, organized manner consistent with simplified caricature design. This artwork maintains proportionality and coherence instead of matching the intricate realistic style but doesnâ€™t demonstrate distortion in the architectural representation. Analyzing morphology with world knowledge of simplified art forms confirms consistency in shapes and proportions, ensuring no breakage.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the tassel material of the badge appear soft and flexible, and does the circular form look natural and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual observation of the tassel indicates a smooth flow and curving lines suggesting flexibility, typical in tassel designs. The badge's circular form remains consistent and evenly shaped, analyzing it with the basic principles of geometry for coherence suggests natural and undistorted characteristics. The depiction aligns with common knowledge of textile flexibility and geometric symmetry, supporting natural appearance.",

      "question": "Does the hand presenting the badge have a natural appearance, with no more than five fingers, and do the lines and shapes conform to ergonomics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a hand offering the badge. It shows a natural configuration typically observed in anatomical depictions, displaying five fingers in an ergonomic manner. The lines and shapes are consistent with the human hand's usual structural form, adhering to realistic ergonomic design knowledge and observation of anatomy ensuring no deviation from natural representation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement of the badge integrate seamlessly into the image, maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility without introducing any artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge is placed on the palm of a hand with clear, seamless visual integration. Its setting maintains structural coherence and is visually plausible, without any apparent artifacts or inconsistencies. Analysis using compositional integration concepts indicates a harmonious blend of elements, such as background cohesion with the sky, thus confirming seamless placement without artifacts.",
