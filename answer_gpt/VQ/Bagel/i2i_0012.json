      "question": "Are Mona Lisa's facial features, such as her eyes, nose, mouth, and smile, rendered naturally without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the facial features are blurred, analyzing the style in which the face is portrayed, typical of Studio Ghibli, usually favors a more simplistic and stylized facial feature depiction. This could result in a less natural rendition compared to the original painting. Given the consistent use of stylization, it might introduce artifacts from the perspective of the Renaissance art style, indicating that it's not rendering them in a naturally realistic fashion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the color adaptation around Mona Lisa preserve structural coherence and avoid unnatural color blending or edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Studio Ghibli style transformation introduces a vibrant and cohesive color palette typical for animation. Edges and blends appear smooth and harmonious, suggesting that the adaptation preserves coherence even with the vibrancy shift, successfully avoiding unnatural transitions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited background in Studio Ghibli style retain its visual plausibility and avoid breaking the geometric shapes seen in the original painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B replicates the layout of the original but with Studio Ghibli's whimsical and soft style, retaining much of the original geometric framing and landscape shapes. The naturalistic environment remains visually plausible, considering the transition from the detailed realism of Image A to the stylistic simplification of Image B.",

      "question": "Are the textures and folds of Mona Lisa's dress depicted in a way that avoids unnatural patterns and maintains a realistic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays Mona Lisaâ€™s dress in a simplified, flat style typical of animation. This shifts in texture detail from the original but does not present unnatural patterns within the context of the new style. While realistic folding is absent due to stylization, it prevents appearing unnatural within the animation framework.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do Mona Lisa's hands in the Studio Ghibli style maintain a natural appearance with correct finger count and ergonomic positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands in the Studio Ghibli style are depicted with the correct number of fingers and ergonomically natural positioning compared to the original. The style sustains an appearance coherent with the animation theme while keeping anatomical accuracy.",
