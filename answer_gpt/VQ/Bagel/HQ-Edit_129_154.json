    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the crown-like head formed from the lid free of distorted edges or broken geometry, and does it maintain a consistent metallic surface with the original teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's head which seems to be formed from the lid of the original teapot exhibits no visible distortions or broken geometries. The craftsmanship of the lid is well-translated into the metallic surface, maintaining consistency with the teapot’s original material appearance in Image A. Edges are smoothly delineated and flow into a cohesive form, indicative of good geometric integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the spout-to-beak transformation maintain a smooth, continuous metallic surface without cracks, unnatural bends, or texture discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the transformation of the spout to a beak is executed seamlessly. The continuity of the metallic surface is preserved without noticeable cracks or unnatural bends. The transformation reflects a natural transition, maintaining the integrity of the texture and surface quality present in the original spout seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tail formed from the handle smoothly curved and proportionally aligned with the body, without abrupt angles or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail in Image B originates from what is assumed to be the teapot's handle in Image A. This element displays a smoothly curved structure with proper alignment to the body of the constructed owl. There are no abrupt angles or inconsistencies in the material, suggesting a seamless and thoughtful transformation from the handle into the tail region.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical eyes positioned symmetrically on the head, with visible cogs and soft glow that do not cause halos, color bleeding, or texture mismatch with surrounding metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical eyes in Image B are symmetrically positioned on the owl’s head, creating a balanced aesthetic. The details of the cogs and illuminated elements within the eyes are well-defined and do not exhibit halos, color bleeding, or texture mismatch with the surrounding metal, which highlights meticulous detail work reminiscent of the teapot’s intricate designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden branch beneath the owl well-integrated into the scene, with consistent wood texture, shadowing, and depth relative to the original table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B introduces a wooden branch, replacing the original table surface of Image A. This branch is well-integrated with a consistent wood texture that reflects natural shadowing and depth, consistent with the original setup of the teapot on the table, anchoring the owl in a believable environment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the engraved patterns across the body now resemble metallic feathers with consistent layering and directionality, without pixelation or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The owl’s body in Image B is covered in engraved patterns transformed into metallic feathers. These feathers exhibit consistent layering and directionality, showcasing attention to detail that mirrors the original engraved motifs in Image A. The adaptation maintains clarity and detail without signs of pixelation or information loss.",
