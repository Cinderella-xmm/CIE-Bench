      "question": "Does the character's face maintain its natural appearance and texture while integrated into the soft vinyl material without visible unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's face is softened in a manner consistent with vinyl figures, which typically have smooth surfaces lacking intricate facial detail. The integration of the face into vinyl material likely results in a simplified texture to match the medium, which is characteristic of vinyl figures, hence 'natural' for this medium. This assessment does not identify any unnatural artifacts present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the character's body proportions and posture logically consistent and visually credible within the form of a soft vinyl figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features body proportions that are exaggerated to fit the chibi or soft vinyl style, with a larger head and rounded features, standard for such figures. The posture is upright and stable, typical for display purposes, aligning with what is expected from a well-designed vinyl figure.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the character's suit retained its detailed textures and material realism without introduction of unnatural artifacts in the soft vinyl figure design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suit in Image B appears simplified while maintaining essential features like seams and padding outlines, typical of a chibi figure adaptation. The detailing is consistent with typical vinyl figure suit designs, which prioritize stylization over hyper-realistic detail due to the nature of the material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the interchangeable accessories, such as weapons and hand gestures, integrate seamlessly with the figure's design without disrupting its structural consistency or introducing visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the weapon held by the figure fits naturally in the hand. Such accessories are typically designed as part of the figure's global character presentation, allowing appropriate integration without artifacts that could disrupt structural or visual consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character stand naturally on the black base without visible distortion or unnatural support, ensuring the figure's visual stability and plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the character standing firmly and naturally on a black base, which serves as the usual support for such figures to enhance stability. The figure appears stable without distortions or visible issues in support structure typically required for display.",
