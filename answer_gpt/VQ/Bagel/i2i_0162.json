      "question": "Does the mouse's fur texture appear smooth and maintain the natural look expected in a Pixar-style animation without unnatural or overly simplified patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur on the mouse appears stylized and smooth in a manner consistent with Pixar-style animation. Pixar animations often simplify textures for a polished, clean look while maintaining charm and personality in character design. The fur in Image B adheres to this aesthetic, appearing intentionally smooth without unnatural or overly simplified patterns.",

      "question": "Are the mouse's ears, eyes, and whiskers proportionally correct and not distorted relative to its body size in the Pixar animation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the mouse with large, expressive eyes and proportionally larger ears, typical traits seen in Pixar animations to emphasize cuteness and character appeal. The whiskers are also long and distinctive, fitting well within the Pixar style. The proportions overall are consistent with animation design principles that aim for appealing and believable character designs, enhancing personality traits rather than focusing on realism.",

      "question": "Do the soft shadows under the mouse and surrounding crumbs appear naturally integrated into the scene without any harsh or misplaced artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the Pixar-style animation of Image B, shadows appear soft and subtle, which helps integrate the character and the crumbs naturally into the scene. Pixar often uses gentle shading to maintain a balanced lighting environment that complements the stylized look. No harsh or misplaced artifacts are visible, maintaining the immersive quality of the scene.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a simplified and smooth floor texture with subtle details typical of animated environments like those in Pixar films. The floor does not have detailed textures like a real photograph but maintains a sufficient level of stylized detail to appear natural within the animated context without overly artificial patterns.",
