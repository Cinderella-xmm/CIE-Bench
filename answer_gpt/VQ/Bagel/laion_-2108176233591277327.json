    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed object maintain a continuous, symmetrical egg-like shape with no visible breaks, jagged edges, or misaligned contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is depicted as having a smooth and continuous egg-like shape. This can be determined by noting the consistent curvature and absence of any disruptions or irregularities in the shape of the egg. The symmetry is apparent as both sides of the egg are visually balanced, maintaining an even and unbroken contour. Such characteristics are typical of an egg shape, indicating that the object is intact and well-formed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the feather-like patterns seamlessly integrated into the surface, with consistent line thickness, shading, and color gradients matching the original level of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases feather-like patterns that are meticulously woven into the surface of the egg. The lines exhibit consistent thickness and are smoothly rendered, indicating that there is no noticeable variation or inconsistency. The shading provides a realistic allocation of light and dark areas, complementing the color gradients which flow naturally across the feathers without abrupt changes. This implies a high level of detail, matching a coherent design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wing-shaped handle smoothly connected to the body of the egg, with realistic feather layers and no visible gaps or distortions in its curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wing-shaped handle is depicted as being seamlessly connected to the egg. The feather layers are elaborately detailed, with the feathers exhibiting realistic overlapping and layering, which suggests a lifelike structure. The connection to the egg is smooth, without any visible gaps or awkward transitions between the wing and the egg itself, emphasizing coherent construction.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the nest-like rim have a layered, organic structure with consistent material texture and properly placed jewel accents that do not appear displaced or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nest-like rim in Image B is designed with a layered texture, conveying an organic and natural appearance. The material texture is consistent throughout, suggesting an intricate and cohesive fabric. Jewel accents are strategically placed along the rim, aligning with the design patterns. None of the jewels appear out of place or give the impression of floating, reflecting careful and deliberate placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing embers produce a subtle luminous effect that enhances the patterns without causing blurring, color bleeding, or unnatural highlights on adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing embers in Image B emit a soft luminous effect, which enhances the detailed patterns on the egg and its base. This glow is well-integrated, providing illumination that adds depth and vibrancy without introducing blurring or bleeding of colors. The highlights remain natural, emphasizing rather than overwhelming the surrounding areas, maintaining clarity and integrity of the design.",
