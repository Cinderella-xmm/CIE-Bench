      "question": "Does the crack on the Axe container appear natural and maintain the structural integrity of the container without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container appears to have a crack through which a nebula is visible. The crack has an irregular shape with jagged edges, which is inconsistent with how containers are typically damaged. A natural crack would likely show stress patterns or fractures, but in this image, the crack seems exaggerated for visual effect, compromising the container's structural integrity. Therefore, it does not appear natural nor free of artifacts.",

      "question": "Does the miniature nebula inside the container blend naturally with the interior of the container and maintain visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nebula appears within the container through the artificial crack. The nebula's colors and brightness sharply contrast the container's normally dark interior, creating a fantastical rather than plausible effect. The transition between the nebula and the container's interior lacks blending elements that would make it appear naturally occurring. Thus, it does not maintain visual plausibility.",

      "question": "Are the cosmic dust and gases within the nebula detailed and textured, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nebula depicted in Image B shows a vibrant array of colors typical of space imagery, with purple and orange hues indicating cosmic dust and gases. The image appears smooth without evidence of pixelation or artifacts, suggesting a level of detail and texture befitting a nebula representation. Therefore, the nebula's depiction is detailed and free from unnatural artifacts.",

      "question": "Does the size and shape of the nebula fit naturally within the container's opening, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nebula in Image B is visible through a large, jagged crack. Its shape seems to extend beyond the limits of the container, making its placement appear forced rather than naturally fitting within the container's opening. The lack of a seamless interaction between the nebula and the bounds of the container affects the structural consistency and visual credibility.",

      "question": "Are the fiery red and energetic pink hues in the nebula consistent with the label design and contribute to the overall natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fiery red and pink hues of the nebula in Image B echo the colors seen in the label design, creating some degree of color consistency between the label and the nebula. However, the presence of these hues does not lend a natural appearance to the scene when considering color as part of the overall composition. The nebula still appears fantastical and out of place despite the color consistency with the label.",
