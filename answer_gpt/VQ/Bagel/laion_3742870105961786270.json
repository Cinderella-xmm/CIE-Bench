        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stopper in Image B has a heart-shaped, translucent design that displays reflections consistent with glass material, fitting correctly atop the bottle displaying proper alignment. This interpretation is based on visual analysis and common understanding of how glass reflects light.",
