      "question": "Does the parking meter maintain its structural integrity with no signs of distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parking meter retains the defined shapes and textures consistent with what would be expected from a real parking meter. There are no visible signs of distortion or alterations that suggest any structural issues. The meter's surfaces, text, and other details appear normal, suggesting that the structural integrity has been preserved in the editing process.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the transition between the parking meter and the new desert highway background smooth and devoid of visible edges or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the transition between the parking meter and its background is seamless and smooth. There are no visible lines, edges, or breaks that disrupt the integration of the meter into the new setting. This indicates careful editing to ensure the parking meter is well-integrated into the desert highway background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the shadows and lighting effects on the parking meter match what would be expected in a desert setting under bright sunlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadow effects on the parking meter are coherent with the desert setting under bright sunlight. The sunlight appears to be coming from the upper left, lighting the top of the meter and creating realistic shadows and highlights. These effects are consistent with what natural lighting would produce in a desert environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any irregular or unnatural shapes in the desert landscape that seem out of place or disrupt the scene's authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desert landscape shows a smooth highway surrounded by typical desert features, such as shrubs and distant mountains. These elements appear natural and consistent with what is commonly seen in desert environments. There are no irregular shapes or elements that appear out of place.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the parking meter appear naturally placed in the desert highway setting without looking misplaced or awkward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the unusual combination of a parking meter and a desert highway, the meter is visually well-integrated and does not appear awkwardly placed. The angle, lighting, and scale make it seem as though it could practically exist in this setting. The editing maintains the meter in harmony with its environment, minimizing any awkwardness in placement.",
