      "question": "Do the chibi sheep maintain their original interaction pose by the railing in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi sheep are positioned near the railing, similar to their positioning in Image A where real sheep are shown interacting with a metal railing. The positioning of the chibi sheep appears to be based on the alignment of the real sheep. Therefore, the interaction pose by the railing is maintained. The alignment shows the chibi sheep positioned similarly to the real sheep against the fence, which preserves the original interaction stance.",

      "question": "Are the winter accessories (scarves, earmuffs, gloves) added to the chibi sheep free from unnatural textures and retain fine details similar to the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the winter accessories such as scarves, earmuffs, and gloves on the chibi sheep appear cartoonish, which is consistent with the overall flat style of the image. The accessories do not show unnatural textures that conflict with the cartoon aesthetic; instead, they integrate well within this style. Given the overall design in Image B, these accessories, while simplistic, do match the detail level presented across this cartoon depiction.",

      "question": "Do the proportions and poses of the chibi sheep appear physically plausible and coherent with the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi sheep are cartoon renditions, which inherently have stylized proportions. The pose of the chibi sheep aligns with the railing similar to the real sheep in Image A; however, the physical plausibility is slightly altered due to stylization. Despite having exaggerated proportions typical of chibi figures, their interaction with the environment remains coherent within the cartoon context of Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the flat, cartoonish style conversion of the sheep maintain a sense of realism without introducing obvious unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms the realistic sheep into chibi-style characters. While this style does not aim for realism, it is coherent for a cartoon version. The conversion does not introduce artifacts; shapes and lines remain clean and intentionally simplified per the art style used. In considering realism in a cartoon context, while it diverges from natural realism, it does not introduce errors or artifacts that undermine the intended flat style integrity.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the edited image, including the chibi sheep and their accessories, preserve visual credibility and structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B maintains visual credibility within its stylized, flat design. The chibi sheep are coherently spaced similar to the real sheep in Image A and their accessories, while simple, are consistently applied. The structural layout remains similar to the original image, preserving positioning at the fence, and the simplified elements blend well within the chosen art aesthetic. Overall, there is consistency in the visual presentation and design choices.",
