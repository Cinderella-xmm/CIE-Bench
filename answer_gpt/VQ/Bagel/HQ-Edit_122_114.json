    {

      "question": "Are the cogs and gears forming the nest properly aligned and interlocked, showing no visible gaps or floating elements that break geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cogs and gears must visually suggest that they are part of a working mechanical system, which includes proper alignment and interlocking without any gaps or floating components. The visual continuity among these gears is crucial for an impression of functionality and stability. There should be no floating elements that disrupt the geometric consistency, indicating well-engineered placement.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the copper pipes run along the roof edges in a physically plausible manner, with consistent thickness and no abrupt bends or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An analysis of Image B reveals that the copper pipes are intended to mimic the structure of roof edges. For physical plausibility, these pipes should maintain a consistent thickness and follow logical pathways along the architecture of the house model without abrupt, unrealistic bends or unsupported sections. Their integration should reflect craftsmanship akin to mechanical design principles.",

      "question": "Are the metallic plates covering the stork’s body arranged in a way that follows the underlying anatomy, without unnatural overlaps or gaps between plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the metallic plates on the stork should be analyzed in terms of how well they conform to the contours and joints of the bird's anatomy. The arrangement should ideally mirror how feathers naturally lay on a bird, with no significant gaps, overlaps, or misalignments that break anatomical flow or suggest artificiality outweighing the design's intent.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical joints at the stork’s neck, wing, and leg connections properly shaped and positioned to match the movement range of a real bird, without appearing distorted or misplaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Mechanical joints in Image B should be critically assessed for anatomical accuracy, matching the freedom of motion available in a bird's neck, wings, and legs. The positioning and design of these joints should emulate natural joints found in birds, suggesting avenues for realistic movement while maintaining structural integrity, avoiding distortion or misplacement.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the integration of mechanical elements (cogs, pipes) with the wooden house maintain proportional harmony and avoid elements that appear disproportionately large or suspended without support?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all mechanical elements such as the cogs and pipes need to be evaluated for their proportional relationship with the rest of the house. The architecture necessitates that these components neither dominate nor get lost in comparison to the house, suggesting a balanced design. Elements should be firmly attached with structural support, avoiding any appearance of disproportion or suspension.",
