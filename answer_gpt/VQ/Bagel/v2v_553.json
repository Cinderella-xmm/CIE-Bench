      "question": "Do the robes worn by the panda mage have a natural texture and material appearance without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robes of the panda mage appear smooth and well-integrated with the character's design. The texture seems natural and resembles the fabric with decorative patterns. This appearance aligns with the expected characteristics of robes in a fantasy setting, where cloth usually looks flowy and patterned. There are no visible artifacts that distract from the overall look, suggesting a polished rendering.",

      "question": "Does the glowing staff held by the panda mage blend naturally into the image without introducing unnatural light effects or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing staff is held by the panda mage and features a soft light at its tip, emitting a warm glow. The lighting effect is consistent with a magical theme and does not show signs of harsh edges or misaligned brightness that would disrupt the image's harmony. The light seems to interact believably with surrounding elements without introducing unnatural distortions.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the panda mage and the white horse visually credible and structurally consistent with each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a fantasy card-style portrayal where the panda mage is seated on a white horse. While the panda mage has chibi characteristics that make its proportions deliberately stylized, the size relation between the mage and the horse is consistent with similar fantasy themes, where mounts are manageable and fit for small-scale characters. This maintains structural consistency for the genre.",

      "question": "Does the background enhance the magical and harmonious theme without showing any unnatural textures or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is soft and slightly blurred with warm tones and abstract patterns, contributing to the magical ambiance of the card. It lacks harsh contrasts or out-of-place elements, creating a cohesive visual theme supportive of harmony and fantasy. The textures and hues align well with the main subjects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the panda mage's face and expression appear natural and coherent without any signs of distortion or unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the face is not to be considered due to blurring, excluding the blurred section, Image B shows that the panda mage's face and expression are rendered in typical fantasy card style, featuring characteristic features and expressions that fit the theme. The design remains cute and non-threatening, typical of chibi artwork without signs of graphical distortion.",
