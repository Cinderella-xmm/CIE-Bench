      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks forming the hot dog uniformly shaped, properly aligned, and free of distorted or misshapen pieces that compromise structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembling a hot dog is constructed using LEGO bricks. LEGO bricks are typically designed to be uniform in shape and fit together in a structured manner. The image shows that the bricks forming the hot dog are consistently shaped and properly aligned, as is characteristic of LEGO construction. The bricks do not appear distorted or misshapen, illustrating good structural consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the ceramic mosaic bottle feature smooth, non-glass-like surfaces with clearly defined geometric patterns in red, yellow, and tan, without unnatural reflections or transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceramic mosaic bottle made from LEGO bricks displays well-defined geometric patterns in various colors, including red and yellow. Given that LEGO bricks are made from plastic, they naturally have a matte finish and do not exhibit transparency or glass-like reflections. The image confirms these characteristics, and no unusual reflections or transparency are present, making the surface appear consistently smooth and opaque.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the LEGO hot dog's length proportionally consistent with the original hot dogâ€™s size relative to the cutting board and nearby objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the original hot dog in Image A appears on a cutting board and is proportionally appropriate to its surroundings, such as the bottle and the cutting board. In Image B, the LEGO recreation of the hot dog seems to have a similar scale relative to the wooden base and other objects, maintaining the same proportions as those observed in the original setup. The proportional size remains consistent, maintaining the intended visual relationship with the other elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the ceramic bottle have a rounded, flowing shape with no sharp angles or blocky geometry that would disrupt visual harmony with the LEGO hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ceramic bottle in Image B, constructed from LEGO bricks, possesses a shape representative of LEGO design, which naturally features blocky geometry; however, the bottle is built in an attempt to mimic a rounded form. Despite some sharp angles due to the brick shapes, it largely maintains a cohesive structure that complements the LEGO hot dog. Considering this, the visual harmony with the hot dog is preserved despite the blocky nature of the bricks.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden base under both the LEGO hot dog and ceramic bottle seamless, with consistent wood grain and color matching the surrounding table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base supporting both the LEGO hot dog and the ceramic bottle exhibits a consistent wood grain and color that matches the tabletop it rests upon. There are no visible seams or mismatched wood textures. Observing the image, the base seamlessly integrates with the rest of the setting, maintaining a uniform appearance consistent with the tabletop.",
