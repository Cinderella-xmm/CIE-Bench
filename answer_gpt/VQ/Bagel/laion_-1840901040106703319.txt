    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal facets on the cabin’s walls, roof, and windows evenly shaped and aligned with the original cabin’s triangular and rectangular outlines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure showcases irregularly shaped crystal facets with sharp angles and varying sizes. These facets do not align with conventional architectural outlines like triangles and rectangles seen in cabins. The design appears abstract with no obvious correlation to a traditional cabin frame. Therefore, given the visual cue of abstract, unevenly shaped crystal facets in Image B, the answer is that they are not evenly shaped or aligned with the cabin's outlines.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the blue and green hues on the crystal surfaces show variations in transparency and light reflection consistent with real glass or crystal, rather than uniform solid colors?",
    "explanation": "Image B exhibits crystal surfaces with varying colors and degrees of transparency, typical of materials like glass or crystal. The gradient of hues and differences in how light reflects across the surfaces suggest variations in transparency and reflectivity, not uniform solid colors. The play of light on the crystal facets aligns with how real crystal or glass might interact with light.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the vertical support beams and horizontal railings converted into crystal forms that maintain their original spacing, height, and alignment with the cabin’s frame?",
    "explanation": "Image B lacks distinct vertical support beams and horizontal railings that align with a typical cabin's frame. The abstract design of the crystal structure suggests a break from conventional construction styles, where such elements would be clear and consistently spaced. This separation of design elements implies they haven't been converted while maintaining the original spatial and height configurations.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the white marble platform beneath the cabin flat, continuous, and free of cracks or irregularities, and does it extend evenly under the entire base of the structure?",
    "explanation": "The white marble base in Image B appears flat and continuous, with no visible signs of cracks or irregularities. However, due to the angle of the image and the lack of observable information about the extent of the base under the entire structure, it is unclear if it extends evenly under the main structure. The visible area doesn't show irregularities, maintaining a polished look.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the small crystal formations along the base of the cabin proportionally smaller than the main structure, grouped in clusters, and positioned in a way that suggests natural growth rather than random placement?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows smaller crystal formations surrounding the main structure, each significantly smaller than the main facet, and grouped together rather than placed haphazardly. This clustering is reminiscent of natural crystal growth patterns in groups, suggesting a deliberate design choice replicating organic crystal growth instead of a random layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
