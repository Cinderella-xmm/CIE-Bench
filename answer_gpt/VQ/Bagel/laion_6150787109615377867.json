      "question": "Does the gear surface on the tabletop show consistent metallic sheen and detailed engravings without blurred or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a tabletop with an intricate design featuring gears and engravings. The metallic sheen appears uniform across the surface, highlighting the detailed carvings. The edges are well-defined without any blurring or jaggedness, indicating high image quality. A consistent metallic surface usually reflects light evenly, which is evident here, helping in confirming the clarity of the detailed engravings.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the piston-driven limbs symmetrically arranged and proportionally scaled to the central column, with clearly defined joints and no bent or broken segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piston-driven limbs emanating from the central column are arranged symmetrically. They are proportionally scaled relative to the central column, and the joints are well-defined, exhibiting a coherent mechanical structure. The segments appear intact, without any visual indication of bending or breaking. Proper mechanical designs typically show such symmetry and proportional scaling, which is reflected here.",

      "question": "Are the steam vents evenly spaced along the central column and properly embedded into the metal surface without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the steam vents are observed along the central column; they are evenly spaced and seamlessly integrated into the metal surface. They do not appear detached or misaligned, reinforcing the mechanical aesthetic of the piece. Well-engineered components usually exhibit such orderly placement, contributing to functionality and aesthetics.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cog patterns and dials on the base have intact geometric shapes with uniform spacing and no overlapping or incomplete features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image features cog patterns and dials on the base that demonstrate intact geometric shapes and consistent uniform spacing. There are no overlapping or incomplete elements visible, ensuring a neat arrangement. Precision in mechanical component arrangement typically results in complete, non-overlapping features, enabling optimum functionality.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brass and copper accents clearly differentiated from the silver metal by color and reflectivity, without unnatural gradients or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass and copper accents are distinguishable from the silver metal by both their color and reflectivity. These accents have a warm tone distinct from the cooler silver elements, showcased through natural gradients that adhere to realistic lighting conditions. There are no texture artifacts, confirming the clarity and quality of the image concerning material differentiation.",
