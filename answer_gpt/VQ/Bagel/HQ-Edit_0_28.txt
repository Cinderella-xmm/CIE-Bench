    "Question": "Q1: Are the abstract geometric patterns on the man's robe seamlessly integrated into the fabric without introducing visible texture mismatches, jagged edges, or unnatural color shifts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man's robe features abstract geometric patterns that appear stylized and consistent with a hand-drawn or painted aesthetic typical of artistic illustrations. The integration of these patterns shows smooth transitions and consistent colors that blend with the rest of the artwork. There are no visible texture mismatches, jagged edges, or unnatural color shifts that would disrupt the visual coherence of the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the transformed lamp bases retain recognizable brass-like material properties and maintain proportional geometry consistent with their original structure when stylized as corner flourishes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lamps have been stylized into corner flourishes with a simplified, illustrative form. Despite the transformation, they retain the general shape and recognizable features of the original brass lamps, maintaining a sense of proportional geometry and hinting at metallic properties through color and highlights.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the extended portion of the bookcase visually continuous with the original section, showing consistent shelf spacing, book alignment, and lighting without visible seams or distortions?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not feature a bookcase as seen in Image A; instead, it is replaced with a completely different background consisting of a flat, less complex design. Therefore, the question of visual continuity with a bookcase does not apply here. The stylization choice omits the bookcase entirely, focusing instead on a symmetrical design with decorative elements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the script elements embedded within the bookcase surface rendered with appropriate transparency and scale so they do not obscure books or create unnatural layering effects?",
    "explanation": "Image B replaces the concept of books and a bookcase with a flat graphic design that includes textual elements. These script elements are part of this new illustrative style, and they are prominent and legible, not embedded transparently onto a bookcase. The design ensures they are integrated as part of the artistic theme, not as an overlay, avoiding any obscurement or unnatural layering. Therefore, the question of transparency and interaction with books does not apply as they are not present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the area intended for inspirational quotes display a clean, unobstructed region with consistent lighting and texture that allows for future text placement without visual disruption?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the area surrounding the man is well-organized and clean, providing ample unobstructed space for potential text placement. The consistent lighting and texture of the background allow for easy addition of inspirational quotes without any visual disruption, maintaining the integrity of the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
