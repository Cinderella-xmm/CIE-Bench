    "Question": "Q1: Are the floral patterns on the dress clearly defined, proportionally consistent with the garment’s scale, and free from jagged edges or pixelated artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the details of the dress's design. The floral patterns are smoothly integrated with the fabric without pixelated edges, suggesting a high-quality digital illustration that maintains consistent design elements when scaled across the dress. Such clarity and proportionality indicate careful attention to detail, meaning the patterns are both well-defined and appropriately scaled.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the lighting from the top right cast soft gradients on the woman’s face, dress, and nearby flowers without causing unnatural overexposure or disconnected highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is depicted as coming from the top right, casting gradients across various elements like the woman’s dress, face, and the surrounding flowers. The gradients are subtle and do not create harsh contrasts or overexposure, which can disrupt the visual balance. This careful gradation maintains the natural appearance of highlights and shadows across the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the floating petals distributed evenly in mid-air, showing natural dispersion and depth, with no clustered or floating-in-place anomalies?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the petals are scattered throughout the mid-air portion of the image. They are evenly distributed, with a natural sense of movement and depth that suggests they are caught in a gentle breeze. The petals do not display any unnatural clustering or stationary appearance, which helps in maintaining a dynamic and realistic portrayal.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the floral vines forming the writing area extend naturally from surrounding plants, maintaining consistent thickness, color, and growth direction without abrupt starts or breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floral vines that define the writing area appear to originate seamlessly from surrounding plant formations. The vines have consistent thickness and color, and their extension is continuous and logical, with no jarring starts or breaks. This coherence suggests intentional design that aligns with natural growth patterns, contributing to a harmonious composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the woman’s left hand show five distinct fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and does the hand appear attached correctly to the arm without distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's left hand, though positioned dynamically, shows all five fingers with natural curvatures. The fingers are distinct, with appropriate spacing. Additionally, the hand is attached correctly to the arm, with no signs of anatomical inaccuracies or unnatural distortions, capturing a convincingly proportional and realistic form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
