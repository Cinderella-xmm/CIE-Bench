      "question": "Does the chibi character maintain proper structural consistency, with the head being slightly oversized yet naturally proportioned to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi characters are known for their exaggerated features, especially larger heads compared to their bodies, which is part of their aesthetic appeal. In Image B, the chibi character has a large head compared to its body, which is typical for this style. The head-to-body ratio is suitable for a chibi drawing which is meant to be cute and stylized, thus maintaining structural consistency within the chibi art style.",

      "question": "Are the gray T-shirt and shorts of the chibi character accurately and naturally represented, without introducing any unnatural textures or color discrepancies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gray T-shirt and shorts of the chibi character are drawn in a flat color style typical of cartoon and chibi art styles. The colors are solid and consistent, matching the simplified, cartoonish aesthetic and not showing any unexpected textures or discrepancies.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cartoonified skateboard retain its visual plausibility with no unnatural textures or loss of fine details that would disrupt the scene’s authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skateboard in Image B is simplified in style to match the chibi character. It has basic coloring and outline, which is typical for cartoon representations. There are no detailed textures expected in chibi illustrations; instead, overall form and readability are emphasized, which are effectively maintained here.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the new hand-drawn city skyline background coherent and visually plausible, contributing positively to the overall scene without disrupting the main character’s prominence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the city skyline is drawn with simple lines and basic shapes, which complements the style of the chibi figure. This helps maintain the character's prominence by not introducing overly complex elements that would detract from the central chibi character. The minimalistic skyline suits the overall aesthetic and does not overpower the character.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit overall authenticity and natural appearance, with no obvious artifacts or distortions introduced during the stylization process?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, features a chibi style that includes simple, bold lines and flat colors, which matches the expected style of chibi illustrations. This approach inherently lacks in photorealistic detail by design, reflecting the intended artistic style accurately without artifacts or errors that seem out of place.",
