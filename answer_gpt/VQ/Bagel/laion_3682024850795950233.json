      "question": "Does the bread slice retain a natural crumb texture and crust edge without visible smoothing or unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bread slice has visible crumb texture and a crust edge that appears natural and consistent. The visual cues show the texture details typical of bread, without any signs of artificial smoothing or distortion. Bread, as a common food item, usually retains a slightly irregular texture due to its nature. Thus, the depiction of the bread slice aligns with expected natural characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial features positioned within the bread slice and aligned with its surface plane, without appearing detached or floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays facial features directly on the surface of the bread slice, making it look integrated into it rather than detached or hovering. Common imagery or graphics involving character faces on objects maintain an aligned perspective to avoid the appearance of floating, which is successfully achieved here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the lettuce leaves forming the cape show consistent leaf texture and natural curling, without flat or uniformly colored sections suggesting loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lettuce leaves display texture variations and a natural curling effect, which is typical for real leaves. Leaf texture usually involves many details like veins and varying shades, helping to maintain its organic appearance. The image captures this complexity, avoiding flat or overly uniform sections which would suggest simplified graphics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the hand-drawn illustrations in the timeline clearly defined with uniform stroke thickness and no visible pixelation or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustrations in the timeline of Image B show well-defined strokes and consistent thickness throughout. The lack of pixelation or broken lines indicates a clean illustration style, which is common in well-prepared graphical content. This maintains the artistic integrity of hand-drawn illustrations without digital artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all circular icons perfectly round with smooth edges and consistent fill color, without any jaggedness or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular icons appear perfectly round with smooth edges, maintaining the expected geometry for such shapes in graphic design. Modern design techniques ensure that icons are free from jagged edges or irregularities, providing a polished and professional look. The fill color is consistent too, contributing to the overall visual consistency.",
