      "question": "Do the textures and materials of the baseball and glove appear natural and consistent in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures and materials of the baseball and glove seem simplified and lack the detailed texture expected from leather and a baseball surface. This can be noted by the absence of nuanced skin texture on the glove and the missing seam details that usually characterize a baseball, which can be concluded from the simplified and somewhat flat color representation. Comparing this with common expectations of these objects, which are more textured and detailed, the textures do not appear natural.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the baseball and glove accurate and maintain their expected size relationships in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the baseball and glove are judged based on visual perspective and common knowledge of these objects. In the frontal views, the glove appears oversized in relation to the baseball when compared to expected standard sizes where a glove typically envelops a baseball fittingly. This inconsistent proportional relationship is visible across all presented views due to an irregular scaling that is clear from the visual presentation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts, such as jagged edges or unnatural blending, around the baseball or glove in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outline and areas where the glove and baseball interact appear with some visible digital artifacts. There are areas of rough transitions and jagged edges evident, particularly noticeable around the stitching and intersecting portions where subject boundaries are defined. Such artifacts suggest an improper rendering of the image elements, in contrast to a smooth and organically blended appearance expected in high-quality imagery.",

      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the baseball and glove look natural and consistent with the lighting conditions in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows and highlights lack gradation and realistic depiction typically observed with rounded surfaces like a glove and a baseball. The directional lighting seems improperly accounted forâ€”resulting in the absence of consistent depth and contouring expected from real-world lighting conditions where multiple surfaces would cast and receive varied shadows. Thus, they appear unnatural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition and layout in each of the three views (top, side, sectional) logically represent the baseball and glove in a visually credible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the intent is to represent multiple angles of the glove and baseball, the execution in terms of composition and layout shows inconsistencies. The layout is not credibly logical as the perspective projections fail to accurately convey a realistic three-dimensional understanding of baseball equipment. Without logical sequencing and spatial relationship continuity between images, the composite does not portray a believable representation.",
