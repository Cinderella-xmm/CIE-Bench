      "question": "Are the red-and-gray train and STOP sign geometrically simplified without introducing distorted or broken shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train and STOP sign are depicted with minimalistic, solid and clean cuts relying on geometric shapes. The lines are smooth and continuous without any distortions or breaks. This geometric simplification aligns with world knowledge of how minimalism removes unnecessary complexity while maintaining recognizable forms.",

      "question": "Do the green mountain outlines and track lines look naturally integrated and consistent with the cool-toned minimalist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows green mountain outlines that are smooth and uniform in color, fitting well within a minimalist aesthetic that often favors simplified silhouettes and flat colors. The track lines are straight and simple, aligning with the reduced complexity typically found in minimalist art. This analysis follows the logic that minimalism often emphasizes integration of elements through simplicity and uniform color use.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the textures of the simplified train and STOP sign been maintained well enough to avoid loss of essential details and unnatural appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the train and STOP sign with a flat design and without textures or intricate detailing, characteristic of minimalist art. This consciously avoids fine textures but maintains essential details and overall recognizable shapes that preserve functionality and prevent unnatural appearance, which aligns with world knowledge regarding minimalist designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the minimalist illustration maintain the correct spatial relationship between the train, STOP sign, and tracks without disrupting visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the spatial relationship between the train, STOP sign, and tracks by positioning them similar to their logical real-world arrangement. The train follows the tracks and the STOP sign is positioned in front, indicating importance in safety. This understanding is based on spatial logic that minimalism follows real-world spatial arrangements even within simplified aesthetics.",

      "question": "Does the cool-toned color palette remain consistent throughout the minimalist illustration, effectively supporting the traffic safety visual style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette maintains cool tones such as blue and green, indicative of a serene and conscientious visual language often used in safety designs. The consistent palette fosters a coherent and calm visual effect, aligning with world knowledge about using colors to enhance safety communication in designs.",
