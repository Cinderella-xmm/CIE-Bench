      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character appears to be stepping or emerging from a television screen.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character holds the shield firmly in front, which aligns well with the character's overall posture.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B appears as a stylized representation, yet despite the stylization, notably featuring large boots and hands akin to toy proportions, there is a consistent proportionality within those artistic choices, avoiding any evident distortion or abnormal scaling within the character's design.",
