      "question": "Does the character's transformation into an anime-style action figure maintain natural textures and fine details without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the character as an anime-style action figure, which naturally exaggerates certain features compared to realistic textures. Such figures usually have smoother surfaces and more simplified textures, which are consistent with anime aesthetics. There are no signs of unnatural artifacts; the figure appears as a typical stylized toy. Thus, the anime-style transformation is appropriate for this context.",

      "question": "Does the box design seamlessly integrate with the rest of the image, maintaining visual credibility without disrupting the overall scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a toy box that matches the style of typical commercial packaging, including background patterns related to the theme of the action figure. The design elements, like the map and clouds, fit well within the packaging theme. The box does not disrupt the scene but rather complements it as an appropriate setting for displaying the figure, maintaining visual credibility.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the airplane-related elements incorporated into the box design proportionally correct and physically rational, avoiding any distortion or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartoon-style airplane that aligns with the theme of the action figure and toy box. Its smaller scale fits seamlessly into the context of being part of the toy package. The proportions and shapes are consistent with the intended design style, without any visible distortion. Despite the fantastical setting, the elements conform to expected proportions in toy designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the character's dynamic pose atop the small airplane wing appear structurally consistent and visually credible, without any unnatural deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is seen in a dynamic pose on a small toy airplane wing. While the pose may seem exaggerated, it is consistent with the playful and imaginative scenarios typically represented in anime and toy designs. There are no noticeable structural inconsistencies or deformations relative to its intended representation as a stylized toy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the hyper-realistic figure beside the box rendered realistically and naturally, resembling a professionally photographed product?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hyper-realistic figure in Image B is designed with smooth textures and polished surfaces typical of toy figures, emulating the look of a professional toy product. The representation maintains realistic material rendering standards common in toy photography while aligning with its anime-style theme. Thus, it satisfactorily resembles a real product in photographic representation.",
