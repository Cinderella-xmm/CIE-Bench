    "Question": "Q1: Does the outline of the guitar body remain intact and undistorted after being converted into an armored torso?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar body has been incorporated into a graphic design where it's integrated as part of an armor worn by a fictional character. The outline of the guitar body is visible but it is stylized to fit the context. It does not remain intact in the form we see in Image A, as it has been altered to fit the dimensions of the character's armor.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the metallic finish applied to the guitar body consistent with the original wood grain pattern, showing no signs of artificial texture tiling or unnatural reflections?",
    "explanation": "Image B features an illustration where the guitar body is stylized alongside the character. The design includes illustrative elements, rather than a realistic metallic finish. The drawing does not attempt to mimic the wood grain of the guitar as seen in Image A. Instead, the design follows cartoon-like patterns and colors, indicating no attempt to maintain the original wood grain pattern.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the illustrative lines evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the guitar's curvature without overlapping or cutting through structural elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar is part of a stylized illustration. The lines in the artwork follow the design of the character and are stylistically placed. While they are aligned with the guitar's shape, there are bold outlines and usage of colors to emphasize the illustrated form, which overlaps and intertwines with the character's design.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the strings appear as continuous, taut muscle strands that follow the bodyâ€™s contour without kinks, gaps, or floating segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the strings are part of an illustration with a fictional character playing the guitar. The strings are represented in a cartoon style, following the orientation of the guitar neck. Though they appear continuous in the illustration style, this does not reflect realistic taut muscle strands.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the cape extend naturally from the neck, showing smooth folds and consistent sound wave patterns along its length without abrupt changes or breaks?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a character with a cape and dramatic sound wave patterns used as artistic elements around the character. The cape flows naturally within the context of the illustration, showing smooth folds, and the sound waves add dynamic motion, fitting stylistically within the entire graphic design.",
