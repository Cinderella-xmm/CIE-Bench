    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior maintain accurate limb proportions and body structure without distorted joints or exaggerated features?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior is designed with realistic limb proportions and an anatomically accurate body structure. The joints are correctly aligned, and there are no exaggerated or disproportioned features. This is consistent with typical representations of fantasy warriors, where due consideration is usually given to anatomical correctness for aesthetic and believability purposes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the metallic blue surfaces of the armor rendered with natural light reflections and depth, avoiding flat or uniform coloring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the armor's metallic blue surfaces display variations in light reflection and create a sense of depth. There are highlights and shadows, which contribute to a three-dimensional and non-flat appearance. This is consistent with how metal surfaces typically interact with light in reality, adding a sense of realism to the model.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the trident positioned correctly in the hand and scaled appropriately relative to the figure, without bending or truncation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trident held by the Aquatic warrior is properly positioned within the hand and is proportional to the figure's size. The trident appears straight and maintains its structural integrity without any bending or truncation. This proper scaling and positioning ensure that the model looks balanced and realistic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the dome enclosing the model have smooth curvature and consistent transparency without visible stitching, warping, or reflection anomalies?",
    "explanation": "The dome in Image B appears to have a smooth curvature and consistent transparency. There are no visible stitching or warping issues, and the reflections on the dome do not exhibit any anomalies. This suggests a high-quality rendering of the dome, maintaining a polished and coherent appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the coral reef base textured with natural-looking organic patterns and scaled appropriately to support the model without appearing undersized or oversized?",
    "explanation": "The coral reef base in Image B is textured with organic patterns that resemble natural underwater formations. The base is well-scaled concerning the model, providing adequate support without seeming too small or disproportional to the size of the warrior figure. This attention to detail enhances the overall realism of the setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the swirling ocean currents around the model follow continuous, directional flow paths without abrupt breaks or floating fragments?",
    "explanation": "The ocean currents in Image B exhibit smooth, continuous flow paths, enhancing the sense of movement and dynamic interaction with the environment. There are no abrupt breaks or floating fragments, which contributes to a cohesive visual effect and supports the model's underwater theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the hand holding the trident have exactly five fingers with natural joint angles and grip pressure, without extra digits or unnatural bends?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the trident appears to have five fingers, all of which exhibit realistic joint angles and a natural grip. There are no extra digits or bends that would seem unnatural, which is important for maintaining anatomical accuracy in models that depict human or humanoid figures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are all elements (model, dome, base, currents) spatially aligned and layered correctly, with no floating or disconnected parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the model, dome, base, and swirling currents are all aligned and layered correctly. Each component appears to be in the correct spatial position relative to the others, with no indication of floating or disconnected elements. This careful spatial alignment helps create a cohesive and believable scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
