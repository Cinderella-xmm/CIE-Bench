    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the gold-finished surfaces of both cheetah figures smooth, reflective, and free of unnatural textures or patches that suggest digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottles designed to look like cheetah figures with gold finishes appear to be smooth and reflective. The surfaces do not show any digital artifacting, like unnatural textures or patches, suggesting that the editing preserves the intended smoothness and reflective qualities akin to polished gold surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the translucent green-tinted glass façade maintain clean, continuous edges and realistic light transmission without visible distortion or abrupt transitions at its boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green-tinted glass façade in Image B is characterized by smooth, continuous edges and clean light transmission. The absence of visible distortions or abrupt transitions indicates a realistic portrayal of glass, which is crucial for maintaining its transparent and reflective properties.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"Savanna Essence\" clearly visible, correctly positioned on the base, and rendered with sharp edges and consistent font style without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Savanna Essence' appears clear and sharply rendered on the base of the central green glass structure in Image B. The font style is consistent, without blurring or misalignment, ensuring that the branding is legible and professionally placed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the transformed cheetah figures maintain their original sitting posture and anatomical proportions, with no visible elongation, compression, or deformation of limbs or torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetah figures, represented as perfume bottles, maintain a stylized form rather than the detailed anatomical proportions of cheetahs. There are no visible signs of elongation, compression, or deformation as the bottles are abstract representations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the two golden cheetah-bottle figures symmetrically aligned with the central glass façade, and do they cast consistent shadows that match the lighting direction and surface reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden cheetah-bottle figures in Image B are symmetrically aligned on either side of the central green glass façade. The lighting direction and surface reflection result in consistent shadows, indicating careful alignment and consideration of light interaction in the composition.",
