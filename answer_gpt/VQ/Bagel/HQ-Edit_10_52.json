      "question": "Does the woman's face and body maintain natural proportions without exaggerated or distorted features such as uneven eyes, misplaced limbs, or unnatural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual cues from Image B, the woman's body is depicted in a stylized, cartoonish manner, which is common in chibi or animated representations. Her body proportions are simplified and the style does not aim for realism. Instead, it conforms to a certain artistic style that includes larger heads and simplified body shapes. As such, within the context of the artistic style used in Image B, the proportions are consistent and intentional rather than exaggeratedly distorted or misplaced.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the dress enlarged proportionally without breaking their natural shape or causing jagged edges, and do the gold highlights blend seamlessly into the fabric texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the dress are stylized and smoothly integrated into the design. They do not appear to have jagged edges and maintain consistent shapes, which is in line with the expected look of cartoon or animated designs. The gold highlights are drawn to highlight the patterns without breaking natural forms, blending into the dress without obvious disruption.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the radiant hues applied to the dress appear smooth and evenly distributed without visible color bleeding, unnatural glow artifacts, or disrupted fabric texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents colors that are vividly applied in a style typical of illustrated content. They appear to be smooth and evenly distributed, especially given the nature of the artwork. There are no signs of color bleeding or unnatural artifacts. The artistic medium used does not display a textured fabric in the traditional sense, but rather in a painted/cartoon technique.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the abstract bamboo shadows align with the existing light source and cast believable depth without appearing detached, inconsistent, or overlapping incorrectly with the figure or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a stylized representation of bamboo, which fits consistently with the cartoon art style. The shadows and highlights align well with the notion of light coming through and casting upon the scene; there are no noticeable inconsistencies or misalignments that would be expected in a realistic depiction. The presentation is artistically cohesive.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bamboo-shaped writing panel positioned naturally within the scene, with smooth edges and watercolor motifs that match the surrounding textures and do not exhibit harsh lines or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The writing panel in Image B is incorporated as part of the design aesthetic with smooth lines and coloring that match the art style. Its edges are consistent with the watercolor method used throughout the image, and it blends naturally with its surroundings without harsh lines that stand out or disrupt the scene's cohesion.",
