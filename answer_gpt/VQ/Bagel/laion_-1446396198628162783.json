    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the newly added mission control elements (such as consoles, screens, or panels) geometrically consistent with the room's perspective and do not appear to float or clip through surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any mission control elements such as consoles, screens, or panels, hence there are no elements to assess for geometric consistency or issues of floating/clipping through surfaces.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the color-coded sections for training stages (e.g., Physical Training, Technical Skills) have clean edges and are they positioned so they do not overlap or obscure the astronaut’s suit or feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are color-coded sections for training stages positioned around the astronaut. Each section is distinct with clear edges, ensuring that they do not overlap with or obscure the astronaut's suit or feet.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the illustrative icons (e.g., treadmill, simulator) proportionally sized and placed at appropriate distances from the astronaut so they do not appear oversized or misplaced in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustrative icons in Image B, although abstract, are appropriately sized and placed around the astronaut effectively, ensuring they do not look disproportionately large or improperly positioned in relation to the overall graphic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the explanatory text for each training stage clearly readable, properly aligned, and not overlapping with the astronaut’s body or suit components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text associated with each training stage is positioned clearly outside the body margins of the astronaut, ensuring readability and proper alignment without overlap with the suit or body components.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the astronaut’s suit joints (e.g., elbows, knees), gloves, and helmet fully intact with no visible distortion, warping, or missing texture details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut's suit, including joints like elbows and knees, gloves, and helmet, appear intact without discernible distortion, warping, or missing texture details, portrayed in a stylized illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the added mission control elements (e.g., consoles, icons) align with the direction of the original ceiling lighting and do not contradict the existing shadow patterns on the floor and astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no added mission control elements casting shadows in Image B as it is an illustrative infographic without real-world lighting effects mimicking shadow patterns seen in Image A.",
