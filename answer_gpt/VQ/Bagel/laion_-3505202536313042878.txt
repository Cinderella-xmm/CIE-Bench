    "Question": "Q1: Do the man's limbs and torso maintain proportional relationships and natural joint articulation despite stylization?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized illustration of the man retains typical human proportions, such as the length of the arms, legs, and torso. These components are consistent with common human anatomy despite the simplified rendering style. The articulation points align correctly, mimicking realistic human posture despite artistic simplification.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the textures of the tuxedo and fur jacket rendered with sufficient detail and depth to appear physically plausible despite stylization?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the tuxedo and fur jacket are simplified but display visual cues such as shading and contour lines that suggest folds and texture. These elements give an impression of depth and material distinction that is plausible within the style's context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the FIA logo and sponsor names clearly visible and correctly formed within the simplified linear background design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background design is more abstract compared to Image A. The simplified linear style does not clearly depict the FIA logo or sponsor names. The focus of the design appears to be on geometric patterns rather than specific textual details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the gold ribbon-like border fully closed, evenly shaped, and consistently thick around the entire perimeter of the stamp?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold border around the stamp is complete, maintaining a consistent width and an evenly shaped perimeter throughout the design. This closed and uniform border ensures that the stamp design appears tidy and professionally finished.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the embossed logo on the blue envelope show consistent depth, soft shadows, and surface texture without appearing flat or artificially rendered?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background of the blue envelope is designed with graphic elements that mimic embossing. However, these elements lack realistic depth and soft shadows, appearing more like printed patterns rather than true embossing. They do not replicate the texture and shadows found in a real embossed surface.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the stamp positioned with appropriate shadowing and perspective to appear physically attached to the envelope surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stamp is positioned with clear delineation from the envelope, but it lacks shadowing and perspective cues that would suggest physical attachment. The stamp appears as part of a flat design rather than affixed on an envelope, failing to convey depth and adherence accurately.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do both individuals have exactly five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no deformation or missing digits?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stylization of the individuals retains the correct number of fingers with no apparent deformation or missing digits. The illustration maintains natural and typical hand shapes despite the simplified artistic rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
