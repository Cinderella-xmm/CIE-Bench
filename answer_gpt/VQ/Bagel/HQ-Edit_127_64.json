      "question": "Are the stylized seating icons positioned on the grass without overlapping or displacing real people or objects, and do they cast consistent shadows matching the sun's direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized seating icons are abstract and part of a graphic about park etiquette, not actual seating icons on the grass. Therefore, they don't overlap or displace real people. The only real shadows present are for depicted objects or people, acknowledged as part of a graphic design illustrating etiquette rather than precise photography. Given that, questioning about shadows from icons isn't relevant in this context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the speech bubble graphics appear above or near walking figures without intersecting limbs or clothing, and are they proportionally sized relative to the human figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubbles in Image B are part of a stylized graphic illustration on park etiquette. In this graphic, there are some speech bubbles designed for aesthetic purposes and are not meant to integrate with realistic elements or walking figures. Therefore, concerns about intersection with limbs or clothing in a real-world context aren't applicable; the bubbles are proportioned to the graphic icons rather than actual human figures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the camera icon featuring the Eiffel Tower correctly scaled and positioned so that its outline matches the tower's silhouette and does not exhibit distortion or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a graphic about etiquette, featuring symbolic representations like an Eiffel Tower and camera icons. The icons in the graphic are stylized and not meant to match real-world proportions or realism; they serve a decorative purpose. Distortion or edge artifacts are irrelevant to the intended outcome as graphical art doesn't necessarily follow strict proportionality seen in photography.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the vertical split line align with the center of the pathway and extend consistently from foreground to background without cutting through key structures like the Eiffel Tower or hedges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a deliberate vertical split in the design bifurcating the graphic illustration into two sections that discuss etiquette at a conceptual level. Because this isn't depicting a natural scene or pathway, the split line is part of the graphic design rather than altering an existing photographed scene. Thus, it cannot cut through key structures like those in Image A because it doesn't depict them.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cool green tones applied uniformly across the image without causing visible color banding, loss of detail in shadows, or unnatural saturation in the sky or leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a stylized graphic using cool green tones as part of its entire color scheme to visually and thematically convey messages and etiquette. This treatment is different from adjusting tones in a traditional photograph with concerns about banding, shadow detail, or saturation. The uniformity and aesthetic choice hold since this is purposeful artistic shading rather than a photo-editing concern.",
