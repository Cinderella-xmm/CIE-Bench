    "Question": "Q1: Does the keychain version of the character maintain the same proportions and colors as the original image, without any visible distortion or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain features the character Psyduck with consistent proportions to its typical depiction in various media. The character has its iconic large, round eyes, a wide, flat duckbill, and an overall rounded body shape, similar to Image A.
