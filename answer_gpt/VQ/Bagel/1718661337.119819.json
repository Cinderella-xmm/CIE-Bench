      "question": "Does the brown leather trench coat have consistent texture and natural folds that align with human body contours, and are the brass gears and mechanical details integrated without disrupting the coat's structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brown leather trench coat is observed to have a well-defined texture and natural folds that seem to align with the expected contour of the human body, suggesting a realistic representation. The brass gears and mechanical details are blended into the coat without appearing to disrupt its structure, maintaining a seamless design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the goggles on the tricorne hat are positioned in a manner that respects the hat's structure. There are no visible floating parts or unnatural shadows that would indicate inconsistencies. The integration reflects no clipping errors, suggesting a seamless combination.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The airships and floating cities in Image B are depicted with an appropriate sense of distance, aided by consistent lighting and atmospheric perspective. They don't overlap with the subject in a way that seems unnatural, maintaining a coherent and believable scene.",
