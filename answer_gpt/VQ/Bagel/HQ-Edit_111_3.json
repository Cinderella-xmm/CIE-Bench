      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the monochrome line-drawings for the antennae, wings, abdomen, and thorax accurately aligned with the actual anatomy of the butterfly and do they follow its natural contours without overlapping incorrectly or creating geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monochrome line-drawings on the butterfly's body parts, such as the antennae, wings, abdomen, and thorax, should follow the natural contours of the butterfly accurately to depict its anatomy properly. Analyzing Image B, it's apparent that the lines are not aligned correctly because the text accompanying the lines is nonsensical and does not match the parts it labels. This indicates an inaccuracy in alignment and labeling, thus creating a sense of distortion or incorrect overlaps that deviate from an anatomically correct depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the added pink petals appear seamlessly integrated into the surrounding flora with consistent lighting, texture, and shadow alignment, avoiding any visible seams or artificial edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pink petals that accompany the butterfly must be examined for seamless integration with the surrounding environment. The petals should match in terms of lighting, texture, and shadowing to appear natural. However, the petals in the image appear artificially illustrated rather than being naturally integrated, with distinct and clear lines that suggest an unnatural addition rather than a seamless integration.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the text boxes positioned in non-obtrusive areas of the image, clearly readable, and visually balanced so they do not interfere with the butterfly or floral elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text boxes present in Image B should be positioned so that they do not obstruct or interfere with the main subjects, in this case, the butterfly and the flowers. Upon analysis, the text is positioned close to the butterfly and flowers but does not overlap them. However, the text within these boxes is nonsensical, impacting readability, and the proximity to key visual elements may cause distraction, reducing visual harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the vibrant blue color of the butterflyâ€™s wings preserved uniformly across all areas, including under and around the overlaid anatomical lines, without any visible discoloration or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In evaluating the preservation of color in Image B, it is essential that the vibrant blue of the butterfly's wings remains consistent and undistorted by the overlaid anatomical lines. The examination of Image B reveals that the vibrancy and uniformity are maintained across the wings despite the line overlay, without significant visible discoloration or detail loss.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, pixelation, or unnatural textures in the areas where edits were made (e.g., line drawings, text boxes, added petals)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of any digital artifacts needs careful inspection, such as jagged lines or pixelation, particularly in areas like line drawings, text boxes, and added petals. The diagrammatic nature of the image suggests a digitally rendered style, and the nonsensical text and mismatched line labeling could indicate errors or artifacts, leading to an artificial, less polished appearance.",
