    "Question": "Q1: Does the mosaic pattern on the saree maintain uniform tesserae size and alignment across the fabric, with no visible seams or distorted tiles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the saree appears to be embellished with mosaic patterns, presumed to consist of tesserae. Visual cues suggest that tesserae sizes are consistent, and alignment is uniform, displaying an even texture without seams or distortions. Mosaics typically rely on uniform tesserae alignment for aesthetic and structural coherence; hence, visual assessment affirms these qualities within the fabric in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the arches and dome of the transformed building structurally coherent, with straight edges, consistent curvature, and no broken or misaligned geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, architectural features like arches and domes reflect consistency as they portray smooth curves with definitive structure. Straight edges and alignment are essential for architectural integrity; thus, the visual assessment of Image B shows that these elements are kept consistent without visible breaks or connections that appear misaligned.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Do both hands show five fingers each, with natural finger spacing and joint alignment, and no extra digits or unnatural bending?",
    "explanation": "Assessing Image B, both hands are illustrated naturally with five fingers, maintaining regular spacing between them. Joint alignment appears proper, with no unnatural bending or extraneous digits visible. Natural human anatomy consists of five fingers per hand with specific joint alignments, which is visually sustained in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the floral motifs evenly distributed and proportionally sized relative to the surrounding architecture, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "The examination of floral motifs in Image B reveals they are arranged evenly, with suitable proportionality aspects, relative to the surrounding architectural elements. They do not overlap or seem to float inappropriately. Visual design principles entail that motifs integrated into mosaic patterns uphold proportional symmetry and deliberate placement, which is evident in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Does the golden backdrop exhibit smooth gradient transitions and subtle surface variations, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural shine?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop showcases golden hues with fluid gradient transitions, allowing for subtle surface variation. No abrupt color changes or shine anomalies are detected visually, which comply with aesthetic standards for mosaic craftsmanship typically characterized by seamless gradient and rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
