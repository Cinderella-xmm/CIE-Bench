      "question": "Do the chibi-style characters maintain natural proportions and avoid unnatural distortion in their body shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi-style characters are typically characterized by exaggerated features such as large heads and small bodies, which are considered natural in this style. In Image B, the characters indeed follow this style with proportionally large heads and smaller bodies, which aligns with the conventional chibi design approach. Therefore, the style follows its own natural logic, hence maintaining 'natural proportions' within the chibi context.",

      "question": "Are the traditional Chinese wedding outfits (changpao, magua, xiuhe gown) depicted with vivid details and natural textures, fitting well with the chibi characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outfits show intricate designs, including traditional elements like dragons and phoenixes, with clear and vivid colors that are congruent with the exaggerated and stylized features of chibi characters. The portrayal of these traditional outfits retains enough detail to be recognizable and adds charm, complementing the chibi form well.",

      "question": "Does the ruby-red backdrop with the \"囍\" paper-cut design blend naturally with the rest of the image, enhancing the festive atmosphere without causing visual disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ruby-red background in Image B is a classic color associated with Asian wedding ceremonies, especially Chinese traditions, symbolizing happiness and good fortune. Coupled with the '囍' (double happiness) design, it seamlessly meshes with the theme, enhancing the celebratory tone and does not distract from the primary focus but rather contributes to the overall mood.",

      "question": "Are the golden dragon and phoenix designs on the chibi characters' outfits detailed and coherent, without any loss of fine details or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the golden dragon and phoenix patterns with a sufficient level of detail, showing coherent patterns appropriate for a stylized depiction fitting for chibi characters. The intricacy and clarity of the designs are preserved, and they integrate smoothly over the fabric, avoiding any unnatural texture that might stand out.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the image, including the chibi characters, horse-drawn carriage, and festive backdrop, remain structurally consistent and visually credible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates a combination of chibi characters set in a context implying pre-modern European elements (carriage) side by side with traditional Chinese elements (outfits and backdrop). While a creative blend, the composition maintains distinct sections for each cultural reference thereby structurally accommodating both seamlessly. However, in terms of a visually credible scene combining both disparate elements can lead to incohesiveness.",
