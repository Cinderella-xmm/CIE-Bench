    "Question": "Q1: Are the neon accents added to the motorcycleâ€™s body emitting a consistent, smooth glow without harsh edges or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a futuristic representation of a motorcycle with neon accents visible around the wheels. These neon accents appear to have a consistent and smooth glow, indicating a well-executed visual effect without noticeable harsh edges or pixelation. This creates a seamless, clean look consistent with a high-quality digital rendering, which suggests the neon accents are well-integrated into the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the hover wheels maintain symmetrical, closed geometric forms without visible deformation or broken spokes?",
    "explanation": "The wheels on the motorcycle in Image B appear as perfect circles, suggesting hover wheels with neon accents. There are no visible deformities, broken spokes, or inconsistencies in their geometry, indicating that the hover wheels maintain their symmetrical and closed geometric forms. The clean digital rendering upholds the futuristic theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the digital interface seamlessly embedded in the front panel without intersecting or obscuring existing elements like the headlight or mirrors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the digital interface is depicted as futuristic elements on the box packaging, not directly on the motorcycle. However, the presentation suggests no interference with the motorcycle's design. The digital elements are part of the background display rather than intersecting or obscuring physical features like the headlight or mirrors of the motorcycle.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the isometric box exhibit uniform edge lengths and correct angles, with no skewed faces or misaligned corners?",
    "explanation": "The isometric box in Image B presents uniform edge lengths and proper angles, displaying a coherent 3D representation typical of well-produced product packaging. The angles and junctions are precise, with no skewed faces or misaligned corners visible, suggesting high attention to digital design accuracy and rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the transparent window free of warping, chromatic aberration, or ghosting that would distort the view of the motorcycle behind it?",
    "explanation": "The transparent window of the box in Image B allows a clear view of the motorcycle model inside. There is no notable warping, chromatic aberration, or ghosting effects that could distort the motorcycle's appearance. The window provides an unobstructed display, ensuring that the view inside is precise and undistorted.",
    "answer": "Yes"
