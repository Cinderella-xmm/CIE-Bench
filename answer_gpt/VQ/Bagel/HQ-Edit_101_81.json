      "question": "Does the woman's pose maintain anatomical proportion and joint alignment, with no distorted limbs or unnatural bending at the knee, hip, or spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is depicted as a traditional artwork or mural. Her pose is graceful, typical of classical Indian dance postures seen in temple murals. Such poses are aesthetically designed and may not conform to typical anatomical joint alignment, yet they do not appear to be distorted or unnatural. The limbs are proportionate, with harmonious bending and body positioning reflecting traditional art depictions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and folds of the new traditional attire realistic, showing natural draping and flow without unnatural creases or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The attire in Image B is depicted in a style characteristic of temple murals and traditional Indian artwork. The draping and fold textures are stylized, reflecting artistic conventions used in historical depictions. These folds and drapes do not appear to be floating or unnaturally creased, as they follow the accepted patterns seen in cultural art forms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the mural elements blend seamlessly with the existing architectural features (such as windows, walls, and flooring) without breaking continuity or creating visual inconsistencies in depth or scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the context of Image B, rather than fitting into modern architectural elements, the mural integrates its own traditional artistic motifs and structures. The mural stands alone, typical in cultural depictions that especially adorn interiors of traditional shrines or temples. These elements are independent of modern surroundings, therefore, no direct continuity or overlap issues arise with the supposed architectural features.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the added cultural artifacts (such as lamps or decorative items) positioned logically in relation to light sources and shadows, with consistent illumination and no floating or misplaced objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of cultural artifacts in Image B is consistent with traditional Indian art styles, where elements like lamps are integrated into the decorative structure. These artifacts do not misalign with the implicit light source from the artistic perspective, as traditional artworks have their own stylistic shadow depictions that do not necessarily follow real-world physics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do both hands show exactly five fingers each, with natural finger proportions and positioning, and no extra digits or malformed shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands depicted in Image B are stylized according to traditional art conventions. Both hands are shown with five fingers, and the finger proportions and placement appear normal within the artistic style. While traditional depictions may not adhere to anatomical realism, they maintain artistic proportion as seen in classical mural representations.",
