      "question": "Does the transformed violin body maintain consistent surface texture and lighting behavior with a high-quality engraved case, without unnatural sheen or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed violin body in Image B has a dark finish with gold accents and scripted font. Generally, a high-quality engraved case would have a uniform surface texture and consistent lighting behavior to ensure it looks realistic and cohesive. In Image B, the surface texture does not appear to have unnatural sheen or obvious mismatches. Photography of objects with reflective surfaces might exhibit subtle changes based on lighting, but in this case, the body seems to exhibit a consistent texture and sheen common in ornate cases.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gold accents on the chinrest and tailpiece seamlessly integrated with no visible seams, unnatural reflections, or color bleeding into adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the gold accents on the chinrest and tailpiece appear smooth and seamlessly applied, with reflections typical of polished metal. There are no visible seams or color bleeding that would suggest poor integration; the gold accents complement the dark body of the violin without distorting the overall visual harmony. Integration seems effective, contributing to the high-end appearance of the instrument.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the scripted font along the strings clearly legible, aligned with string curvature, and free from distortion or floating effects that suggest digital overlay errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scripted font appears large and decorative, positioned along the strings of the violin. While legibility is somewhat subjective, the font appears readable without apparent distortions, despite the complex curves of the body. There aren't indicators of misalignment or effects suggesting it floats above the surface, which might suggest a digital error. The alignment is close enough to the string curvature to appear intentional and coherent.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the newly designed pedestal stand have proportionally correct legs and decorative elements that match the vintage aesthetic without appearing undersized, misaligned, or structurally unstable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pedestal stand in Image B is ornate, reflecting a vintage aesthetic with carved legs that are proportionate to the seat and violin displayed. The alignment and proportions seem consistent with historical furniture designs, invoked by a plush cushion and wood-carved details. This balance maintains structural stability and visual coherence without appearing misaligned with the weight distribution typical of pedestal designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the key structural components of the violin—such as the f-holes, bridge, and scroll—still present in accurate positions and proportions relative to each other, even after modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized violin with modified elements. Despite the aesthetic changes, key structural components like the f-holes, bridge, and scroll remain in customary position and proper proportion relative to each other. This maintains the functional and recognizable silhouette of the violin, ensuring its musical integrity despite the artistic alterations.",
