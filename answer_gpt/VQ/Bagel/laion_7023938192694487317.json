      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the torso appear uniformly scaled and proportionally enlarged without visible warping or stretching of anatomical features such as shoulders, neck, or waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the torso maintains a consistent and realistic anatomical shape. The proportions of the shoulders, neck, and waist are natural and consistent with an idealized, stylized figurine form. This suggests careful attention to maintaining proportional integrity without distortion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the shirt with a smooth surface and lacks any visible fabric weave patterns or glossy highlights. This uniform appearance is common in polymer-like materials used in figurines, indicating a matte finish.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'Craft' logo in Image B is distinctly visible, with clear and vibrant colors. It appears well-defined and elevated, suggesting it is a separate element affixed on the shirt. There are no signs of blurring, misalignment, or clipping at the edges, indicating precise rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the base under the figurine composed of clean, straight lines with smooth surfaces and subtle reflective highlights consistent with polished metal, and does it appear physically attached yet separable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the base under the figurine features clean, straight lines with a smooth surface. The base exhibits subtle reflective highlights typical of polished metal, suggesting a high-quality finish. This appearance indicates that the base is physically attached yet would be separable in concept.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the face being blurred, the junction between the torso and head appears blended and integrated, maintaining the overall style of the figurine. The torso does not show signs of unnatural blending or distortion that would impact the facial features.",
