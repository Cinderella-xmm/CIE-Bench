      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the character’s head appear significantly larger than the body while maintaining smooth contours and proper alignment of limbs and torso without visible stretching or tearing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character exhibits exaggerated proportions typical of cartoon or caricature art, with a head distinctly larger than the body. The style maintains smooth contours and the limbs, torso, and other body parts are suitably proportioned according to the caricature form without distortion, indicating that the design is intentional and cohesive.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the character’s suit evenly distributed, free from repeating tiles or jagged edges, and do they follow a logical direction consistent with fabric draping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns on the suit in Image B are vivid and appear organically integrated into the fabric's design. They cover the suit evenly, without visible repetition or jagged tile effects, and follow the contours and draping of the clothing logically, enhancing the stylized appearance of the character.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the oversized glasses fully rendered with clear lenses and frames, aligned with the eye region, and without partial transparency or clipping against facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glasses in Image B are stylized as oversized accessories fitting the caricature theme. They are depicted with bold frames and appear aligned with where the eye region would be expected, showing no transparency issues or clipping that would detract from the visual consistency of the character design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the hand have exactly five fingers, with natural curvature and spacing, and are there no distorted knuckles, extra digits, or unnatural shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand in Image B has five fingers that appear naturally spaced and curved, consistent with cartoon-like rendering. While stylized, the depiction avoids distortions, extra digits, or shading errors that could lead to unnatural views, supporting its aesthetic coherence.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the abstract skyscrapers and balloons positioned at plausible distances, casting soft shadows, and aligned with the character’s perspective without floating above ground or appearing detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers and balloons conform to the styling norms where objects appear surreal yet contextually grounded. They align with the character's perspective, and although shadows are stylized rather than realistic, they enhance the vibrancy and coherence of the illustration rather than detach from it.",
