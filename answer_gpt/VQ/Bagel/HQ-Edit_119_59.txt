    "Question": "Q1: Do the exaggerated arms maintain anatomical plausibility with visible muscle groups that follow natural contours and joint alignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arms of the character are highly exaggerated with significant bulk and definition, resembling a caricature. While major muscle groups are visible, the proportions and contours are intentionally distorted for artistic effect, typical in cartoon or comic-style illustrations. Analyzing Image A, the muscles are realistically depicted, showing anatomical accuracy and natural contours. Comparing this with Image B, it's apparent that Image B does not prioritize anatomical realism, focusing instead on stylistic exaggeration.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the gym-themed motifs on the tank top and shorts clearly rendered with consistent material properties and no overlapping or fragmented textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gym-themed motifs, such as the pizza slice and star on the shorts, appear to be deliberately stylized without realistic texture details, aligning with the cartoon style. There are no visible overlaps or fragmented textures, and the motifs are clearly identifiable. In contrast, Image A features a realistic depiction with no visible motifs on the clothing, focusing on texture and material accuracy. Given the cartoon style in Image B, the motifs fit cohesively with this approach.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the colorful icons positioned symmetrically on both sides of the barbell and aligned with the barâ€™s axis without appearing detached or distorted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the colorful icons around the character appear intentionally random and as part of the stylistic design, without a strict alignment to the barbell's axis. The arrangement does not focus on symmetry but rather on creating a playful and busy backdrop. In Image A, the gym setting is realistic, with no such colorful icons present. Therefore, in the context of Image B's cartoon style, the icons are not meant to align traditionally with the barbell.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Do the shadow illustrations in the mirror maintain consistent lighting direction and depth relative to the main subject and surrounding objects?",
    "explanation": "Image B, being a cartoon, doesn't focus on realistic mirror reflections or shadow consistency. It stylizes features primarily for effect rather than maintaining lighting continuity seen in Image A, where shadows and reflections are consistent with the lighting and subject placement. In Image B, the mirror's representation is more symbolic, indicative of the character's stance without detailed shadow and lighting consideration.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the calendar strip aligned horizontally along the bottom edge of the panel and sized appropriately to match the scale of the figure and surroundings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar strip is positioned at the bottom of the panel and appears to be appropriately aligned horizontally. Its size, relative to the content above, complements the whimsical style without overtaking the image or disrupting the scale. Comparing to Image A, where no calendar is present, Image B's alignment seems intentional and coherent within its caricature setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
