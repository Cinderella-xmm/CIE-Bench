      "question": "Do the blue dragons' scales seamlessly integrate with the bowl's blue floral design without appearing as unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue dragons have been added to the scene. Their scales, distinct from the design on the bowl, do not seamlessly mesh with the existing blue floral pattern; rather, they visually stand apart. The dragons' scales have clearly defined textures and shapes that contrast with the floral design on the bowl's surface, revealing them as distinct additions rather than integrated elements. Considering the visual cues, the creatures introduce an additional layer divergent from the dish's original pattern.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the wisps of orange smoke naturally integrated into the scene, complementing the curry without looking out of place or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows no wisps of orange smoke; the elements of curry remain visually consistent without any trace of added smoke. Since there are no wisps to integrate, the question pertains to an element absent from the edited image. Thus, it does not apply.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the dragon eggs retain the shape and texture of the original chicken pieces, ensuring they look like solidified curry without losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chicken pieces remain visually consistent with Image A and there has been no transformation into 'dragon eggs.' The chicken retains its shape and texture similar to the image before editing, maintaining the appearance typical of curries. Therefore, no change has occurred to substantiate the emergence of dragon eggs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the blue dragons positioned naturally above the dragon eggs, maintaining a playful yet coherent interaction without breaking the scene's structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays three blue dragons positioned atop the curry near the cilantro garnish. While the dragons are clearly edited into the image, their positioning is atop the garnish rather than any 'dragon eggs.' The dragons do not seem to interact specifically with any curry pieces but seem added without a coherent narrative context relative to their positioning.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the edited image, including the transformed cilantro, dragon eggs, and smoke, maintain a natural and authentic appearance without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition of Image B includes edited additions of the blue dragons. The cilantro remains unchanged, and no transformation appears in other components such as the chicken (not dragon eggs) or additional smoke. The added dragons stand apart and introduce evident artifacts contrasting with the natural appearance of the rest of the dish, leading to an artificial integration.",
