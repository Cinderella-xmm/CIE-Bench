      "question": "Does the gold spoon maintain the same structural coherence as the original fork with no unnatural texture or distortion in the handle and bowl area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, I observe a gold spoon with a detailed handle featuring ornate patterns. The spoon's structure—handle and bowl—appears consistent and coherent. There are no signs of distortion or unnatural texture in these areas. In comparison, Image A showcases a fork with no evident structural anomalies. Both pieces of cutlery show cohesive designs with textures aligning with their respective materials. Thus, the gold spoon maintains this structural coherence consistently with normal metallic cutlery.",

      "question": "Does the interaction between the gold spoon and the napkin appear natural without disrupting the napkin’s texture or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold spoon is placed on a blue napkin laying over the table. The napkin's texture appears smooth with visible folds, and shadows fall naturally around the spoon without any anomalies. In Image A, the fork similarly rests on the napkin, with no disruptions to the fabric's flow or shadows. This indicates that both images maintain a natural interaction between the cutlery and the napkin, preserving the fabric's texture and shadowing realistically.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the patterns on the gold spoon integrate naturally with the scene and appear as part of the spoon rather than a separate overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold spoon in Image B features ornate patterns on its handle, which appear integrated smoothly as part of the spoon's design without any signs of being overlaid unnaturally. There is consistency in the spoon’s texture and color with these designs. Comparing Image A, which lacks such patterns, the integration still appears natural within this context, showing these patterns belong to the spoon itself and do not disrupt the overall visual harmony.",

      "question": "Does the gold spoon exhibit realistic reflectivity and shine consistent with a metallic spoon under the lighting conditions of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spoon in Image B displays a shiny, reflective surface typical of a metallic object, with highlights and shininess consistent with the lighting conditions reflected from above and surrounding areas. In Image A, similar characteristics are observed in the fork, showing appropriate metallic reflection properties that correspond with the lighting. This indicates the gold spoon's shine and reflectivity are realistic under the image's lighting conditions.",

      "question": "Is the size and positioning of the gold spoon proportionate and physically logical in relation to the napkin, avoiding any unusual scaling issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the spoon placed on the napkin in a balanced and logically scaled manner. The proportions between the spoon and the napkin are realistic, similar to how the fork is positioned in Image A, which also shows consistent scaling without abnormal proportions. Therefore, the spoon's size and positioning are proportionate and fit logically in the scene.",
