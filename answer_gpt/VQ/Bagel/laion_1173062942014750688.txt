    "Question": "Q1: Are the individual bead segments aligned in a smooth, continuous curve that mimics the natural curvature of a serpent's body without abrupt angular breaks or misaligned joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's body is represented in a stylized form, with segments depicted in a continuous and flowing curve. The curvature is smooth and maintains the natural essence of a serpent's body, with no abrupt breaks or misalignment visible within the stylized design. The artistic representation uses flowing lines and interlocking patterns to convey continuity. This suggests that the segments align smoothly as part of artistic coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the blue circular elements positioned at the head end of the serpent in a symmetrical, forward-facing arrangement typical of animal eyes, and do they appear integrated into the surface rather than floating or disconnected?",
    "explanation": "Image B features an artistic rendition of a serpent where blue circular elements are incorporated along the body rather than prominently near the head as eyes. These elements are integrated into the design of the serpent, appearing as part of the decorative pattern across the body segments rather than specifically representing eyes. They do not convey a symmetrical forward-facing arrangement typical of animal eyes near the head, as they are dispersed across the entire serpent’s body.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the black tribal markings follow the natural flow of the serpent’s body segments and avoid sharp, unnatural edges or uniform repetition that suggests digital artifacting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the black tribal markings are presented as part of the artistic design of the serpent and do follow the contour of the body segments. The markings appear to flow naturally with the serpent's curvature, serving as stylized decorations. Despite the stylized approach, these markings maintain their integrity and do not exhibit any sharp, unnatural edges or uniform repetition typically indicative of digital artifacting. The design is consistent with tribal art themes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the tail extend naturally from the rear of the serpent, tapering smoothly and ending in small, loosely connected bead-like tips that appear to hang or sway without breaking the continuity of the structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the serpent is depicted as tapering smoothly and connects into a stylized ending that incorporates several elements suggestive of decorative tips. This stylized representation does not include bead-like tips that hang or sway, but rather follows artistic coherence with consistent patterning throughout. The design does maintain continuity from the serpent's rear; however, it does not showcase any hanging or loosely connected beads.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the surface texture of the serpent’s body uniformly matte or slightly glossy like the original beads, without introducing areas of unnatural shine, roughness, or inconsistent material properties?",
    "explanation": "The serpent in Image B is rendered in a flat artistic design, typical of digital artwork, without texture variations such as matte or gloss. Its representation does not aim to mimic the material properties of beads; instead, it offers a highly stylized and vibrant depiction without textural inconsistencies. The visual features of the serpent are consistent in style and do not suggest unnatural shine or roughness, as would be present in three-dimensional materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"
