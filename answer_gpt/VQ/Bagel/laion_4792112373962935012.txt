    "Question": "Q1: Does the lime wedge retain its natural green hue and textured rind, with no visible distortion or pixelation, even after being shaped into a smiling cap?",
    "explanation": "The lime wedge in Image B is part of an illustrated, stylized depiction and not a realistic representation. It is shaped with a happy face, indicating it's part of a cartoon character design. In such illustrations, natural details like texture and subtle color variations are often simplified or exaggerated for effect. Thus, while it retains a bright green hue and general shape, it lacks the natural texture of a real lime and is a part of a stylized image.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the two ice cubes positioned as eyes clearly defined as solid, translucent cubes with sharp edges and no deformation, and do they sit naturally within the liquid without appearing to float unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ice cubes are stylized as part of the cartoon-character design, serving as eyes. In illustrations, physical properties such as translucency and light interaction are often depicted selectively to emphasize certain design elements. The ice cubes appear solid and have defined edges but are not intended to be realistic in terms of natural interaction with the liquid. Instead, they contribute to the whimsical character design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the sugar rim along the glass edge uniformly granular and continuous, with no visible breaks, smearing, or artificial coloring that disrupts the natural appearance of salt/sugar crystals?",
    "explanation": "The rim in Image B is depicted as a bright pink sugar rim, characteristic of a cartoon style. It appears continuous and without natural texture due to its stylized nature. The color and style emphasize whimsy over realism, and it matches the overall art style rather than depicting the granular detail of real sugar or salt.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the sombrero and maracas have consistent material textures (e.g., woven straw, wood grain, reflective beads), correct scale relative to the glass, and proper shadows that match the lighting direction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the sombrero and maracas are drawn in a cartoon style, where texture is typically simplified or omitted to fit the aesthetic. The sombrero and maracas appear colorful and vibrant but lack realistic material textures. However, they are correctly scaled in relation to the cartoon character design, adhering to the playful and exaggerated art style where shadows and material consistency are not prioritized.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the confetti pieces varied in color and shape, with soft edges and subtle shadows, and do they appear to lie on the surface without floating or overlapping unrealistically?",
    "explanation": "The confetti in Image B is part of a bright, celebratory illustration. They are varied in color and shape but have sharp edges typical of a cartoon style. They appear to float in a space without a defined surface, common in such illustrations, promoting a sense of festivity. The lack of realistic shadowing aligns with the intended playful aesthetic.",

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the text “Fiesta Time!” clearly visible, evenly spaced, and positioned at the top of the image without overlapping or distorting other elements, and does it have consistent stroke width and anti-aliasing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Fiesta Time!' is prominently positioned at the top, clear, and evenly spaced. It does not overlap other elements and is well-integrated into the design. The stroke width is consistent, contributing to the bold, energetic visual of the image. Anti-aliasing is effectively used, giving the text a smooth appearance suitable for the illustration style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
