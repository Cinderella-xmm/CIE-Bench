      "question": "Does the scarecrow’s body exhibit a consistent glossy finish across all areas where straw was replaced, without visible seams, unnatural reflections, or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarecrow appears as an illustration on a packaging box rather than a real-life figure, so the straw is depicted in a stylized manner. There is no indication of replaced straw or any glossy finish present on what would naturally be parts of the scarecrow's straw body. Therefore, the question of inconsistency, seams, unnatural reflections, or texture mismatches does not apply as it would in a real-life context. The illustration style does not attempt to replicate realistic texture changes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hat structurally intact and proportionally consistent with the original, featuring a clearly defined opening at the top that allows for candle placement without distorting its shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat on the scarecrow illustration has been altered to include a candle inside it. The hat shape remains consistent and structurally intact, as it is intended artistically to incorporate the candle. The cartoon-like style on the package ensures that the addition of the candle does not visually distort the hat’s shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the LED string lights positioned along the scarecrow or packaging in a way that emits soft, localized light without causing unnatural bright spots, flickering effects, or visible wiring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, LED string lights are depicted above the scarecrow illustration against the night sky backdrop on the packaging. They emit a soft glow consistent with such decorative lights in illustrations, with no visible wiring or unnatural bright spots that would indicate poor rendering. The lights appear smooth and cohesive as part of the overall artistic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the crow figurine resting stably on the top edge of the box, aligned with gravitational logic, and matching the size and proportions of the birds seen in flight in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crow figurine is placed on top of the box. It appears to rest stably as the image implies a flat box edge, and the crow’s weight distribution looks plausible within the illustration style. However, the crow's size does not closely match the proportions of the birds flying in the background, which are smaller and might not be in direct proximity for accurate comparison.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the packaging surrounding the scarecrow have clean edges, consistent material shading, and proper shadow alignment with the light source, indicating a solid, three-dimensional box structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging appears to have crisp edges and is portrayed with consistent shading that fits within an illustrative style. The shadows on the box align with the light source and maintain a solid, three-dimensional look, supporting the portrayal of a tangible, firm box structure.",
