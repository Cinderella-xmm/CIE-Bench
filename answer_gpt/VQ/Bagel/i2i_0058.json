      "question": "Does the transition between the cow's original body and the new anthropomorphic features of the knight-themed bull maintain a natural appearance without noticeable artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bull is anthropomorphized with knight-themed armor. The transition from a regular bull to an armored, anthropomorphic knight bull appears smooth and natural. The armor and bull's body parts blend well without any visible artifacts disrupting the visual consistency, which is essential for maintaining the believability of anthropomorphism in edited images.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the silver metal armor and cape seamlessly integrated onto the bull without any unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metal armor covering the bull in Image B is rendered with a high level of detail, showing a consistent texture similar to metal and no obvious distortions or mismatches. The same goes for the cape; these elements are integrated well and appear natural, contributing to the visual integrity of the edited image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the medieval forest path background align naturally with the anthropomorphic bull in terms of lighting and perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B, depicted as a medieval forest path, aligns well with the bull in terms of both lighting and perspective. The lighting on the bull matches the ambient lighting from the background, and the perspective allows the viewer to perceive depth, enhancing realism. Thus, the bull fits naturally into this environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical movements of the anthropomorphic bull remain coherent with the rightward walking pose originally depicted by the cow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions in Image B are consistent with what a walking bull might have and align well with the format of the edited image, maintaining coherence in depicting a forward movement down the path. This suggests an understanding of accurate anatomy adaptation for knight armor without altering the intended motion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the brushstrokes in the realistic oil painting style enhance the overall visual plausibility of the anthropomorphic bull, armor, cape, and medieval forest background without appearing overly stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes brushstrokes and a painting style typically seen in realistic oil paintings. These contribute to a cohesive visual story involving the anthropomorphic bull, its armor, cape, and the forest setting. The style is neither underdone nor excessive, positively enhancing the plausibility without being overly stylized.",
