      "question": "Are the transitions between the man's clothing and the cow's fur smooth and free of unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the junctions between the man's white coat and the cow's fur appear natural without sharp changes or discontinuities indicating unnatural textures. These transitions are vital for maintaining a cohesive appearance between the distinct elements of the man's coat and the cow's fur.",

      "question": "Do the proportions of the combined figure, including the size of the horns relative to the body, appear physically plausible and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow's horns appear appropriately sized relative to its body, maintaining a natural proportion seen in Highland cattle. The cow looks proportionate with respect to normal anatomical features of such cattle, and there is no visible distortion regarding the proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the details of the man's white coat and the cow's fur well-preserved and free from unnatural blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's coat and the cow's fur maintain their details without significant loss or distortion. The cow's fur retains its texture, while the coat of the man remains sharp and distinct, indicating preservation of details free from blurring or noticeable pixelation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the posture of the combined figure, including the positioning of the legs and head, appear natural and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the man's walking posture alongside the cow, and the cow's head is positioned forward naturally. This posture is consistent with normal walking scenarios where cows are led by handlers and aligns well with movements depicted in Image A, displaying a natural gait.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement of the combined figure within the scene, including its interaction with the grass and background, appear visually credible and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the combined figure interacts with the grass beneath naturally, as seen in the cow's stance and hoof placement, aligning with a realistic scene. The man and the cow are proportionate to the background, showing credible integration within the outdoor environment without any distortion.",
