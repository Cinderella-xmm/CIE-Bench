      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the text 'Sharp' at the top left blend naturally into the image without causing any visible disruption to the scissors or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Sharp' appears to be integrated into the image with a style that mimics a handwritten or sketched aesthetic, complementing the image's altered sketch-like style. The placement of this text does not overlap with or disrupt the prominent scissor elements or the background, which has been altered to match the overall artistic style of the image. This suggests a deliberate integration that aims to enhance the visual coherence, indicating that the design choice was considered to avoid any disruption.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text 'Clean' at the bottom right rendered in a sketch style that matches the image's aesthetic, without introducing any artifacts or visual noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Clean' in Image B is rendered using a handwritten or sketch typeface that aligns with the overall artistic modified style of the image, which includes contrasting outlines and textures. This rendering is consistent with the visual theme adopted in the image, suggesting intentional design considerations to maintain cohesion between the added text and the graphic style, avoiding visible artifacts or noise.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the scissors preserved, with no apparent distortion in their shape caused by the placement of the texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shape and proportions of the scissors in Image B appear similar to those in Image A, where they maintain their integrity even with the additional texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean'. The edited aesthetic style alters the visual texture but does not seem to distort the scissors' proportions. The careful placement of text avoids overlaps or spatial interference, helping to preserve dimensional accuracy.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the fine details, like reflections and edges of the scissors, remain sharp and unaffected by the presence of the texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits stylistic changes that emphasize outlines and alter surfaces to adhere to the sketch style, suggesting a different artistic representation. While this transformation affects the original fine detail appearance, it intentionally adapts to match the textural style. However, such fine details become less sharp due to the stylized transformation rather than the text overlay.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition of the image, including the positioning of the scissors and the added texts, appear balanced and maintain visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scissors remain centered and prominently placed, providing stable balance in the overall composition. The added texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean' are positioned strategically to draw attention without disrupting the central focus on the scissors, thereby achieving visual balance. The layout reflects intentional placement to maintain cohesive and plausible design, harmonizing elements for aesthetic unity.",
