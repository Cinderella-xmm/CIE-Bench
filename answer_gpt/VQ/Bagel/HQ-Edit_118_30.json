      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the train’s locomotive and carriages transformed into interlocking geometric blocks that maintain their original proportions and alignment along the track without visible distortions or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train's locomotive and carriages are depicted as geometric blocks, evident by the distinct, flat colors and cube-like shapes. These geometric forms are aligned end-to-end while maintaining the concept of a train. Each block is precise and appears to interlock neatly with the adjacent pieces, emulating the composition of a physical train but in a more abstract, puzzle-like manner. This transformation from a traditional train to a series of geometric blocks is distinct, and there are no apparent distortions or alignment issues visible along the track.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the smoke above the train rendered as smooth, continuous swirling white forms that follow the natural trajectory of rising steam without jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the smoke depiction in Image B, it is represented by a smooth, continuous form emerging from the train, following the upward and flowing pattern expected from rising steam. The edges of the smoke are well-defined and lack any jaggedness or disruption in texture, providing a clean and stylized portrayal that fits with the illustrative style of the rest of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all human figures at the station platform replaced by small, flat puzzle-shaped elements wearing vintage clothing, with no visible distortions in limbs or posture, and do they retain recognizable positions relative to benches and luggage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible human figures traditionally posed on a platform akin to those in a typical railway station setting as seen in Image A. However, there are small figures visible in the proximity of the train rendering, suggesting an abstract representation. These figures appear to fit with the surrounding puzzle aesthetic but they do not distinctly replace the original human figures on a station platform scene, thus not fulfilling the conditions of the query.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fields and hills in the background rendered as clearly defined geometric patterns (e.g., rectangles, triangles) that form a cohesive, interlocking design without gaps, overlapping errors, or abrupt texture changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fields and landscape are replaced with puzzle pieces laid out on a tabletop. Each piece has its own distinct color, fitting together without gaps or severe mismatches, creating an interlocking design. The geometric properties of the puzzle pieces ensure that the transitions between colors and forms are coherent and well-defined, supporting the puzzle-like theme.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene, including the train, tracks, station, and landscape, placed on a light wooden tabletop with visible wood grain and consistent lighting, and are there no floating elements or mismatched shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the whole scene is placed on what appears to be a light wooden table. The presence of visible wood grain under the puzzle pieces reinforces this setting. The lighting across the table is even, and there are no identifiable shadows suggesting floating elements or perspective inconsistencies—indicating all visual elements are placed directly on the tabletop.",
