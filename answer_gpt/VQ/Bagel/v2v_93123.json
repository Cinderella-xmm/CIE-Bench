      "question": "Does the lighting on the man and the pineapple appear consistent with the new aged blackboard background, without introducing unnatural shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the man and the pineapple is warm and consistent with an indoor setting, featuring a soft light coming from the left. The new blackboard background is a stark black with white chalk drawings, which tends to absorb light rather than reflect it. The lighting on both the man and the pineapple appears to remain consistent in both images, with no sudden changes in shadows or highlights that suggest inconsistency. Thus, the lighting matches well with the old image despite the new background.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts or unnatural edges where the man and the pineapple meet the new aged blackboard background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the man, the pineapple, and the new blackboard background appears smooth. There are no visible artifacts or unnatural edges that typically indicate a poor cut and paste technique, such as jagged or excessively sharp edges. The integration looks natural, suggesting that care was taken to blend the elements into one cohesive image.",

      "question": "Do the chalk-written equations and galactic sketches on the new blackboard background integrate naturally with the man and the pineapple, maintaining structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chalk-written equations and galactic sketches on the blackboard in Image B complement the image of the man and the pineapple by maintaining the scientific and whimsical theme. The blend between the elements is seamless, and the man appears as though he could be contemplating these equations and sketches. The structural coherence is maintained without any part of the image looking out of place or disjointed from the new background.",

      "question": "Have the proportions and details of the man and the pineapple been preserved, avoiding any distortion or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing Image B with Image A, we can see that the proportions and details of the man and the pineapple have been maintained. The pineapple’s texture, the lines on its surface, and the details on the man's hair and clothing are consistent between the two images. No distortion is evident, meaning that the editing preserved the original integrity of these elements.",

      "question": "Does the texture of the new aged blackboard background complement the man and the pineapple, without introducing any unnatural or conflicting textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blackboard's chalky texture in Image B is consistent with the idea of a classroom or scientific environment, which naturally complements the man's appearance and the pineapple's detailed texture. The aged yet smooth chalkboard contrasts well with the rich textures of the man’s hair and suit, as well as the pineapple, without introducing any conflicting or unnatural textures.",
