      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the hull of the ship display smooth, consistent translucency and iridescent color shifts across its surface without blocky or repeated patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship's hull has been transformed into a crystal-like structure. Observing the image, the hull displays a somewhat consistent translucency and features iridescent color shifts across its surface, indicative of a crystal appearance. However, the structure does display some blocky patterns, which point towards repetitive geometry and potentially digital synthesis rather than smooth, natural crystal shifts. This suggests that while there is an attempt at a crystalline effect, it doesn't completely avoid blocky or repeated patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the windows on the ship's decks replaced with clearly defined, faceted gem-like shapes that reflect light naturally and maintain consistent depth and edge sharpness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the windows on the ship have been altered to blend with the overall crystal theme. However, they don't distinctly showcase well-defined, faceted gem shapes that naturally reflect light as one would expect from well-crafted gems. The edges are not sharply consistent and the depth of these crystal-like transformations isn't consistently represented, indicating that while an attempt was made to depict them as faceted, they lack the clarity and precision of natural facets.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the deck surfaces appear as continuous, structured crystal pathways with no floating pieces, cracks, or abrupt transitions between crystal and non-crystal areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the deck surfaces are transformed to match the crystal theme of the ship. Upon inspection, while they generally maintain the continuity of the ship's surface, there are visible transitions and some inconsistencies in the crystal structure. These include abrupt changes where the crystal ends or appears less structured, suggesting that the deck surfaces do not fully mimic continuous pathways of crystal without abrupt transitions or imperfections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the superstructure of the ship transformed into angular, faceted crystal forms with clean edges and correct proportions, without warped or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the superstructure is artistically altered to become angular and faceted, as would be expected in a crystal-like form. However, upon closer examination, certain areas, especially where the faceted structures meet, exhibit slight warps and imbalances in proportions. These issues point to transformations that aren't perfectly executed, with some aspects of the geometry appearing collapsed or not maintaining ideal proportions.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the background been adjusted to a minimalistic horizon with softened or removed distant islands, while maintaining a smooth transition between the water and sky without visual breaks or mismatches in brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B retains the original setting without much alteration beyond the insertion of the crystalline ship. The distant islands and horizon remain unchanged, suggesting no effort to simplify or minimalize the scenery. This means the water and sky transitions are consistent with the original image, but no additional minimalistic adjustments were made.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the crystal ship positioned correctly on the water surface with no floating portions or misaligned base, and does it maintain proper scale relative to the surrounding water and horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal ship appears to be correctly positioned on the water surface when analyzed relative to the waterline and horizon. The base of the ship aligns well with the water, and the scale of the ship appears appropriate in relation to the surrounding water and distant islands, maintaining a visually coherent placement within the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the crystal surfaces free from repetitive textures, blurred edges, or ghosting effects that suggest digital artifacts or poor synthesis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the crystal surfaces exhibit some areas where repetitive textures are present, contributing to a less natural appearance typical of well-faceted crystals. Additionally, there's evidence of slightly blurred edges and digital artifacts such as ghosting effects around some parts of the crystals, signaling imperfections in the digital creation process.",
