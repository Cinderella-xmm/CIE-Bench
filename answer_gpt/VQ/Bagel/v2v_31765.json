      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the diced vegetables maintain their structural coherence and visual credibility after being transformed into a Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diced vegetables, while altered in color, retain a distinct geometric form with clear edges in the Cubist style. The carrots, celery, and onions are represented as cubes and semi-circles, maintaining structural coherence despite abstraction, aligning with the visual credibility typical of Cubism. Image A shows clearly diced vegetables with precise cuts. Comparing both images, the Cubist representation in Image B reflects a coherent transformation from the original geometric shapes, achieving visual credibility as intended by Cubism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the diced carrots, celery, and onions natural and detailed, without any obvious loss of detail in the Cubist style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textures in Image B have been transformed significantly in the Cubist style, focusing on form and color over texture detail. The original Image A displays detailed textures of the vegetables, such as the surface texture of carrots, but Image B prioritizes geometric abstraction and color blocks over natural texture detail, which is characteristic of Cubism and results in a loss of natural texture.",

      "question": "Do the colors of the diced carrots, celery, and onions appear authentic and harmonious, contributing to the overall natural appearance in the Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the Cubist style with an emphasis on vibrant, enhanced colors that differ from natural tones. The carrots are depicted in bright yellow, celery in pastel green, and onions in bright white, diverging from Image A's more natural huesâ€”orange, green, and white, respectively. This alteration is typical of Cubism, focusing on bold color differences rather than naturalness, aiming for artistic expression over authenticity and harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the diced vegetables intact and undistorted, without any broken edges or unnatural deformations in the Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms the diced vegetables into more abstract shapes, yet these remain undistorted and with clear edges typical of Cubism. Image A presents intact and clear geometric dice forms, which Image B creatively abstracts into Cubist shapes without signs of distortion or broken edges. The Cubist style manipulates perception while maintaining coherent geometric forms.",

      "question": "Does the knife retain its natural appearance and structural integrity, without any obvious artifacts or distortions in the Cubist style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife undergoes a transformation in line with Cubist principles but retains structural integrity and clear definition without noticeable distortions or artifacts. While Image A displays a realistic knife with accurate dimensions and metal sheen, Image B presents the knife with coherent structure and solid form, amplified by stylized color abstraction. The observed transformation prioritizes clear lines and forms characteristic of Cubism without introducing distortions.",
