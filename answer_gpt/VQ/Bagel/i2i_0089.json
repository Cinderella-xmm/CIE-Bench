      "question": "Does the kitten's body appear structurally consistent without any unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten is depicted as leaping with its paws forward. Despite the blur, its body appears proportional and natural. The limbs are evenly sized and positioned correctly relative to the body, and there's no visible indication of distortion or artifacts. The paws and ears visible in Image B maintain a harmonious size relative to the portions of the body visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fur details around the kittenâ€™s face natural and free from any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the face is blurred, the visible portions of the kitten, such as the paws and the ears, still show natural fur details. The texture and coloration of the fur on these parts are consistent with what would be expected for a kitten, showing a realistic rendering of fur without any unnatural textures or loss of detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the kitten's position and perspective accurately simulate a 3D jumps-out effect without breaking its geometric shapes or distorting its proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the kitten in a dynamic pose that suggests movement, giving a 3D illusion of jumping. The visible elements such as the ears and paws maintain their geometric shapes and undistorted proportions, aligning with the perspective necessary for a jump effect. The position of the extended paws supports this illusion effectively.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the material properties of the blue blanket around the kitten look natural, supporting the 3D illusion without introducing any artificial artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no blue blanket present. The question seems to be concerning elements only present in Image A, so this aspect does not apply to Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the kitten's paws shaped naturally, consistently placed, and free from any distortion or unrealistic deformations after applying the 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten's paws are visible in a leaping position, where they appear well-shaped, natural, and without any deformation. The paws seem evenly sized and correctly positioned relative to each other, maintaining their natural appearance despite the 3D jumping effect.",
