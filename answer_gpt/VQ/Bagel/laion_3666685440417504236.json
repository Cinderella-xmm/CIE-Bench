      "question": "Are the dome, minaret, and arches inside the globe proportionally accurate and geometrically intact, with no warped edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dome, minaret, and arches inside the globe appear to be designed as a miniature representation of the original architecture. Observing the structural lines and proportions of these elements inside the globe, they look geometrically intact with no visible warping or broken lines. The design maintains a consistent representation of the elements as small-scale architectural models, indicative of a detailed decorative piece.",

      "question": "Do the palm trees and cobblestone path inside the globe appear at a consistent scale with the architecture and follow a plausible layout leading to the entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees and cobblestone path add to the scenic representation inside the globe. The trees are scaled to complement the size of the architectural features and do not overpower the image. The cobblestone path is aligned to lead towards the entrance of the structure, simulating a realistic and visually appealing layout that contributes to the overall congruence of the composition.",

      "question": "Are the Persian patterns on the exterior of the globe continuous, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the tilework seen on the original building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the exterior of the globe is adorned with Persian patterns that mimic the intricate tilework on the original building from Image A. The patterns are continuous and evenly spaced around the curve of the globe, maintaining a consistent stylistic theme. This reflects an intention to preserve the aesthetic appeal and cultural motifs from the original architectural tilework.",

      "question": "Are the golden highlights on the dome and arches applied in a way that follows natural light interaction, with no flat, overly bright, or artificially drawn lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the golden highlights are applied on the dome and arches with precision, reflecting a natural spread of light over the curved surfaces. The highlights are neither flat nor excessively bright but seem to adhere to a realistic depiction of how light would interact with the rounded and ornate surfaces, adding depth and realism to the miniature representation.",

      "question": "Is the boundary between the interior scene and the globeâ€™s surface clean and free of jagged edges, transparency glitches, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boundary where the interior scene meets the exterior of the globe is sharply defined, with no visible jagged edges or transparency issues. The transitions are smooth, and no unnatural reflections disrupt the visual continuity, suggesting careful attention to the integration of the scene within the globe's surface.",
