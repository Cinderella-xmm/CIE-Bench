      "question": "Are the triangular overlay shapes on the side of the shoe clearly defined and aligned correctly, without warped edges or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the triangular overlay shapes on the side of the shoe are made to resemble wooden carvings. They appear clearly defined and aligned properly, without any warped edges or missing segments. The craftsmanship implies precise construction, which is commonly seen in high-quality woodworking. Therefore, the triangular overlays follow a coherent design that reflects meticulous attention to detail.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wood grain lines flow naturally across the shoe's surface, following the contours of the panels and laces, without repeating or pixelated patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wood grain lines in Image B flow smoothly and naturally across the shoe, reflecting authentic wooden textures. They follow the contours of the panels and laces without displaying any obvious repeating or pixelated patterns, which would indicate digital manipulation. The continuity of the grain enhances the realistic wooden aesthetic, showing attention to detail and craftsmanship.",

      "question": "Are the laces depicted as solid wooden strands with consistent width and proper threading through the eyelets, maintaining their original path and tension?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laces are depicted as solid wooden strands. They maintain a consistent width and are properly threaded through the eyelets, preserving the path and tension traditionally found in shoelaces. The depiction supports the overall wooden aesthetic while respecting the design functionality of the lace system.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the darker and lighter wood tones create a clear distinction between the shoe's main body and highlights, such as the toe cap and midsole, without unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of darker and lighter wood tones effectively distinguishes the shoe's main body from the highlights, like the toe cap and midsole. These tones are applied in a way consistent with wood grains and shades, without any unnatural color shifts. This gradation reflects the natural diversity seen in wooden textures, accentuating the shoe's features.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brand names and logos (e.g., \"Salomon\", \"Speedcross\", \"Contagrip\") clearly readable and accurately positioned on the shoe, with clean edges and no blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe seems to be a wooden-crafted interpretation and does not use traditional branding methods. Therefore, there are no visible brand names or logos that follow the positioning in Image A. This suggests that the focus in Image B is on the artistic wooden depiction rather than on showcasing brand logos.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the outsole feature deep, well-defined treads and a reinforced toe cap, with consistent depth and spacing that matches the original shoeâ€™s geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden shoe in Image B has a detailed wooden carving for the outsole, which creatively interprets the tread design. While it appears well-defined and resembles the original concept, the nature of the material means that it may not perfectly mimic the rubber tread depth and spacing of the original shoe in terms of practical use. However, for a decorative wooden design, the representation is consistent in maintaining the essence of tread designs.",

      "question": "Is the wooden shoe placed on a clean, flat shelf with soft shadows beneath it, suggesting a stable and realistic display environment without floating or misaligned positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden shoe is placed on a clean, flat surface, likely intended to resemble a shelf or display stand. Soft shadows beneath the shoe indicate realistic lighting and grounded positioning. The presentation suggests a stable and coherent display environment, enhancing the visual appeal and realism.",
