      "question": "Does the checkmark pathway appear naturally tangled without breaking its geometric integrity or introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the checkmark pathway is covered with a red tape motif that makes it look tangled, which suggests a more disrupted appearance compared to Image A. The original geometric integrity of the pathway is slightly unaffected but visually altered with a tangled look. The introduction of this motif breaks the natural clean, sleek appearance of a simple checkmark in Image A, giving it an unnatural texture. Therefore, the appearance of tangling does affect its geometric integrity by adding complexity.",

      "question": "Are the overlapping stamps on the 'We verify your Document' icon visually coherent and free from unnatural textures or excessive clutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red tape motif wraps around the icon which creates visual clutter and adds unnatural texture overlay, differentiating the look from Image A where the icon is clear and clutter-free. The motif disrupts the simplicity and coherence by introducing additional elements that do not align naturally with the original design.",

      "question": "Does the red tape motif blend naturally into the orange circular step markers without causing visual disruption or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red tape motif spans over the orange circular step markers. It creates a contrast that overlays on the existing design and introduces a more complex visual texture, which does not appear as a natural blend with the pre-existing color scheme and simple design of Image A. This results in a visual disruption and potential loss of clarity in the steps that were initially clear in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the icons and text within the orange circular step markers still legible and structurally consistent after the addition of the red tape motif?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the addition of the red tape motif, the icons and text within the orange circular step markers in Image B remain legible and their structural integrity is maintained. The motif does not obscure the key elements of the icons or disrupt the readability of the text. Compared to Image A, while there is an introduced texture, the essential legibility is preserved.",

      "question": "Has the infographic maintained its clarity and sharpness without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The introduction of the red tape motif in Image B adds a texture that appears unnatural compared to the clean and sharp design in Image A. This motif introduces a less clear and more complex overlay that may obscure some fine details previously present. Therefore, the clarity and sharpness of the entire infographic are compromised with unnatural textures. The comparison shows obvious degradation in visual quality due to the additions.",
