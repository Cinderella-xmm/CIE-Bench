    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the gold embellishments on the Dashiki naturally integrated into the fabric, showing realistic reflective properties and no floating or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows gold embellishments that appear to be a natural part of the Dashiki. The reflective properties of the embellishments seem consistent with the lighting in the scene, suggesting realism. There are no visible signs of pixelation or floating edges, which would indicate poor integration. Therefore, the embellishments seem naturally integrated.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the beads and symbols on the shoulders align correctly with the shoulder anatomy and exhibit natural material textures without distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the beads and symbols on the shoulders appear to be positioned in a way that aligns accurately with the anatomy, following the contour of the shoulders. The textures look consistent with realistic material appearances, showing no significant distortion or misalignment.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the Acacia trees in the background proportionally accurate and structurally coherent, with natural branching patterns and no visible geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features Acacia trees that appear to be proportionally accurate to the landscape and structurally coherent. The branching patterns of the trees seem natural and do not show any visible geometric distortions that could affect their realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wild grass in the foreground and midground display natural variation in height, color, and orientation, avoiding repetitive or tiled patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wild grass in the edited image shows variation in terms of height, color, and orientation. These variations contribute to a natural appearance, avoiding any repetitive or tiled patterns which would reduce the realism of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands show five fingers each, with natural joint alignment, skin texture, and shading that matches the rest of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the hands are depicted with five fingers each, and they appear to have natural joint alignment. The skin texture and shading are consistent with the lighting and overall appearance of the figure, contributing to a realistic representation.",
