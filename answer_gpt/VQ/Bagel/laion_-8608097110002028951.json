      "question": "Does the facade of the theater building appear composed of uniform tan LEGO bricks with brown accents, without visible seams, irregular patterns, or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facade of the building shows a consistent surface that resembles LEGO bricks. The tan color is uniform, and the accents are brown, suggesting a constructed appearance typical of LEGO materials. However, the image does show some visible lines and irregular patterns that can be akin to the seams between LEGO bricks, which is a familiar characteristic of LEGO designs. Despite these, the question pertains to whether these seams and patterns appear or not. Therefore, the presence of visible seams and irregular textures indicates that the facade is not without such features.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the three large arched windows replaced with translucent square LEGO-style panes that preserve the arch shape but feature a regular grid pattern, without distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arched windows retain their original shape but the inner panes are displayed as a series of translucent square elements, mimicking the LEGO style with a regular grid pattern. The grid is intact and aligns well within the arches, maintaining symmetry and removing any distortion or misalignment. Comparison with Image A shows that this structured, grid-like appearance aligns with typical LEGO characteristics.",

      "question": "Do the \"Walgreens\" and \"Marina Theater\" signs show letters constructed from smooth red flat LEGO bricks, maintaining legibility and alignment with the awning structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the signs above both entrances are constructed as if made of smooth red flat LEGO bricks. The 'Walgreens' lettering and the 'Marina Theater' name maintain a clear and legible format, although the 'Marina Theater' now reads differently ('una Ta'). The alignment of the letters follows the structure of the awning underneath, showcasing consistency with LEGO’s style, but there is a change in lettering which affects legibility.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both vintage cars rendered as blocky LEGO vehicles with simplified shapes, including rectangular bodies, circular wheels, and flat surfaces, without retaining realistic car features like curved fenders or chrome trim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cars have been transformed into LEGO-like models. They are characterized by blocky, rectangular bodies with rounded, circular wheels, fitting the style of LEGO vehicles. There are no intricate details such as curved fenders or chrome trim that are typical of realistic vintage cars. The cars’ features are simplified in a manner reflective of typical LEGO designs, supporting that they do not retain realistic car features.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the LEGO-style cars and building maintain proper scale and alignment with each other and the surrounding environment, with no floating parts, misaligned bricks, or unnatural spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the scale of the LEGO-style cars relative to the building is consistent and aligned with what one would expect in reality, meaning their size and placement in the street environment appear harmonious. There are no visible bricks or components that seem out of place, floating, or misaligned within the context of the scene. All parts fit naturally within this LEGO-styled environment.",
