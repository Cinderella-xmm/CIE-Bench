      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the burgers and fries have been transformed alongside the other elements into a style consistent with the chibi theme.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person has indeed been transformed into a chibi-style figure. Chibi characters typically have exaggerated head-to-body ratios while retaining recognizable features.

This transformation successfully avoids unnatural textures, consistent with chibi aesthetics.",
