    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and grin added to the energy blast positioned within the glowing orb and aligned with its curvature, without creating jagged edges or broken light paths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and grin are elements of the cartoonish depiction of Naruto. They are humorously exaggerated and are positioned within the glowing orb. The alignment seems intentional to follow the contour of the orb, creating a comical effect. Given the stylized nature of the design in Image B, the edges are not jagged, but are designed for comedic impact rather than realistic alignment, which aligns with the theme of the artwork.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dialogue bubble positioned so that it does not overlap with Naruto’s face or hand, and does it have clean borders and readable text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dialogue bubble is placed above the character and doesn't overlap with Naruto's face or hands. The borders of the bubble are clean, ensuring the text inside is visible and readable. The text is clear and sufficiently large, ensuring easy readability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the motion lines and energy beams from the spirit and Naruto’s attack converge smoothly at the fusion point, showing continuous flow without abrupt breaks or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motion lines and energy beams are exaggerated in a cartoonish style. They converge at the fusion point but do not follow the natural, smooth flow seen in more realistic depictions. The style used is coherent within the context of the image but doesn't aim for the smoothness typically expected in a more serious depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the debris and elemental fragments in the background rendered with consistent lighting and shadow, appearing to float in a shared 3D space rather than being pasted flatly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The debris and fragments in Image B are illustrated in a flat, simplified style common in cartoon art, which does not emphasize 3D rendering or consistent lighting and shadows. They are intended to be humorous rather than realistic, giving a flat appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does Naruto’s face retain the original number of whisker marks, eye shape, and headband position, with no distorted lines or missing features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face of Naruto is depicted humorously exaggerated with altered features such as the eye shape and expression. While it doesn't retain the original design of Naruto's features faithfully (such as whisker marks and eye shape), it is clear that this stylistic choice is intentional for comedic effect, meaning the features are present but exaggerated or altered.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the action bubble placed in a visible area of the image without covering Naruto’s hand or the fusion point, and does it use consistent styling with the dialogue bubble?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the action bubble is placed prominently and does not cover critical elements such as Naruto’s hand or the key fusion point. However, the styling of the action bubble, with its bold text and placement at the bottom, differs from the round shape and placement of the dialogue bubble, suggesting a deliberate choice to distinguish between dialogue and action.",
