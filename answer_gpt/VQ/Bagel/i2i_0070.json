      "question": "Does the African savanna at night blend seamlessly with the existing train and tracks, without any unnatural edges or contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train and tracks are positioned against an African savanna setting. The landscape has varied lighting due to the depiction of nighttime conditions. A seamless blend requires consistent color saturation and integration of both elements without jarring transitions. The image depicts clear demarcation lines, particularly where the tracks meet the landscape, indicating a lack of seamless blending and suggesting unnatural edges and contrasts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stars and the Milky Way depicted naturally, without any artificial or pixelated textures disrupting their appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a vibrant, detailed starry sky with the Milky Way clearly visible. To assess natural depiction, it is important to check for smooth gradients and flow without irregularities or pixelation. The stars appear evenly distributed and the Milky Way flows smoothly, offering a realistic representation without apparent artificial textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the train and tracks correspond logically to the new nighttime savanna setting, maintaining structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Nighttime lighting typically results in darker shadows with less distinct delineation than daylight. In Image B, the train and tracks appear well-lit without consistent nighttime shadows, conflicting with the depiction of a dark sky. This suggests the lighting does not logically correspond to the nighttime savanna context, affecting structural coherence.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the size of the train relative to the vastness of the African savanna and the starry sky proportionally correct and believable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Proportionality requires that the train appear small in comparison to the expansive landscape of the savanna and the vast starry sky, maintaining a sense of scale. Image B presents the train at a notable size, which detracts from the impression of an extensive savanna, making the proportions appear less realistic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the train been preserved without degradation or introduction of unnatural textures during the editing process?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For preservation of fine details, the train in Image B should retain its visible elements like contours, materials, and signage without noticeable degradation or new textures from editing. The train's details, such as its structure and labeling, remain clear and crisp, suggesting that its original detail has been preserved effectively.",
