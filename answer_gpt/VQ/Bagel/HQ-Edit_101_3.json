      "question": "Does the illustrated bird retain the original bird's body proportions and head-to-body ratio without exaggerated or distorted features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrated bird shows a stylized version of the original bird from Image A. The depicted bird in Image B has a similar head-to-body ratio as the original, with the head and body proportions well-balanced, similar to how the original bird appears in Image A. No exaggerated or distorted features are observed that deviate from the characteristic shape and size of the original bird.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossom motifs surrounding the bird evenly spaced and proportionally consistent with the original flowers in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms are depicted as stylized illustrations around the bird. When comparing them with Image A, it can be seen that the positioning and spacing in Image B do not follow a natural or consistent pattern of distribution observed with real blossoms. They lack the natural random occurrence and size variety seen in the original photograph, indicating they are not evenly spaced or proportionally consistent with the original flowers.",

      "question": "Is the typographic logo positioned at the top of the image with smooth edges and uniform spacing, free from pixelation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typographic logo in Image B appears at the top of the image. Although it is legible, upon close inspection, the edges of the typography appear uneven and there is noticeable pixelation, particularly around the curves and fine details of the letters. The spacing of the text also varies slightly, indicative of a lack of uniformity compared to a clean, professional typeface presentation.",

      "question": "Does the pastel gradient background transition smoothly from one hue to another without visible banding or sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a pastel gradient background. The transition between hues is meant to be smooth; however, upon inspection, there appear to be subtle areas where the gradient does not transition as smoothly as expected. There are slight indications of banding, which is a visible stepping effect rather than a smooth and gradual transition.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the yellow color of the illustrated bird uniformly applied across its body without patches of over-saturation or loss of fine texture detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow color on the illustrated bird is applied consistently across its surface. Although it lacks the detailed texture found in photographic images, which is expected in an illustration, there are no noticeable patches of over-saturation or inconsistencies that disrupt the uniformity of the coloring.",
