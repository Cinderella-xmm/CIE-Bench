    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the elements of the image, such as the elephant and its environment, unaltered and maintain their original natural appearance without any artifacts introduced in the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a dish artistically plated rather than an elephant in its environment. Elements such as food and presentation have replaced the original image content. This significant change indicates artifacts have been introduced, altering the natural appearance significantly.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the elements within the image appear natural and consistent with the original, such as the roughness of the elephantâ€™s skin and the details of the hay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features food with distinct textures like the surface of the meat and the arrangement of vegetables and sauces, contrasting the animal and habitat in Image A. These changes in material and texture signify a departure from the original elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical features of the elephant and its surroundings, like the hay bale and enclosure, depicted accurately and without unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B no longer depicts an elephant or its environment, but rather a plate of food. The absence of the original subjects suggests that the proportions and features compared to Image A are not maintained, having been entirely transformed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details, such as the subtle lines and wrinkles on the elephant's skin and the strands of hay, been preserved without any degradation or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that Image B does not retain any elements of the original elephant or hay bale but instead shows a culinary dish, the fine details specific to the original content are neither preserved nor relevant in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition of the image, including the placement of the elephant, the hay bale, and the enclosure, maintain visual credibility and alignment with the expected scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's composition revolves around a plate of food, entirely different from the elephant scene in Image A. The new composition doesn't align with the original scene, indicating an intentional re-imagining rather than preservation.",
