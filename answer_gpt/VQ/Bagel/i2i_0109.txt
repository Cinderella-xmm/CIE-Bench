    "Question": "Q2: Are the added lighting effects around the plastic figurine seamlessly integrated with its surface and the surrounding desk, avoiding unnatural highlights or shadows?",
    "explanation": "The lighting effects in Image B appear to be consistent with ambient lighting that might come from a nearby lamp, as suggested by the light casting on the surface of the desk and the overall scene setting.
