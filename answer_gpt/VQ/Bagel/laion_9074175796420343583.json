    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the arms and face drawn on the pie’s surface consistent with the texture and color of the crust, without visible digital artifacts or mismatched shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms and face drawn on the pie are artistically rendered to resemble a character. These details are less about matching the texture and color of the pie crust as seen in Image A and more about creating a cartoon-like effect. The shading and texturing are intentionally designed to give an animated appearance that stands out from the actual pie surface. Thus, the lack of an exact match with the pie’s crust texture and color is due to artistic choice rather than digital artifacts or shading mismatches.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lattice pattern retain its original grid structure and spacing, and does it appear as a draped fabric apron without broken or stretched lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lattice pattern from Image A's pie is transformed into a checked fabric designed to resemble an apron for the pie character. The structure of the 'apron' departs from the original lattice due to its illustrative transformation into clothing, which naturally introduces different line dynamics. Since the goal is to portray an apron, the grid lines might not perfectly align with the original pie lattice, reflecting artistic license rather than an exact conversion.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the knife converted into a feather pen with a realistic quill tip and wooden shaft, and does it maintain a natural transition from the original knife shape without abrupt edges or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife visible in Image A has been depicted as a large knife in the cartoon rather than a feather pen. The intention is illustrative, in-line with the pie being anthropomorphized holding what is clearly meant to resemble the large knife from the first image but without it being converted into a feather pen. The representation does not aim for realism or a pen-like transition, so texture mismatches or abrupt edges were not considerations in this transformation.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the additional pastries positioned at a consistent distance and scale relative to the main pie, and do they cast realistic shadows and reflect the same lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a cartoon and does not depict additional pastries around the main pie character. Instead, the focus is on the pie character itself, without integrating other pastry elements as observed in Image A. Thus, issues of positioning, scale, shadows, or consistent lighting in relation to additional pastries do not apply.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the text bubbles positioned close to the pie’s mouth, legible, and free from overlapping or clipping with the pie or plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text bubbles are placed above the pie character, aligned and consistent with typical comic book style. They are positioned to ensure legibility and do not overlap with the pie character or any other element within the frames. This aligns with the requirements for the text bubbles being functional and clear in their intended context.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the hands on the pie have exactly five fingers each, proper joint alignment, and a natural grip on the feather pen without deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie character does not exhibit realistic human hand features meant to manipulate a feather pen. Instead, it holds a knife as depicted in an exaggerated cartoon style typical of comic characters, without detailed or realistic finger depictions. Thus, examining the natural grip or digit alignment isn't applicable to this type of stylized portrayal.",
