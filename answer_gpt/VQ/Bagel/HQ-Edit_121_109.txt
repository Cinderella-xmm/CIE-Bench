    "Question": "Q1: Do the hummingbird's wings display a seamless, continuous iridescent glass-like texture with natural light reflection and rainbow color gradients, free from jagged edges or artificial-looking patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hummingbird's wings are designed to resemble rainbow-colored glass shards. The iridescent effect is achieved with smooth color transitions and a glossy texture that mimics light reflection. There are no visible jagged edges or pixelated patterns, and the color gradients appear natural, suggesting a well-executed glass-like appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the luminescent petals covering the hummingbird’s body arranged in a way that follows the bird’s body contours without gaps, overlaps, or unnatural spacing, and do they exhibit consistent lighting and translucency?",
    "explanation": "The petals covering the hummingbird's body in Image B follow the contours smoothly. They are evenly spaced without noticeable gaps or overlaps, creating an appearance that is harmonious with the bird's natural form. The petals also show a consistent level of translucency, aligning with the overall luminescent theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the crystalline spout seamlessly integrated into the hummingbird’s head, with realistic internal refraction and a coherent, gravity-consistent flow of nectar emerging from its tip?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystalline spout extends from the hummingbird's head in a visually coherent manner. The internal refraction is portrayed realistically, with light bending as expected within a crystal structure. The nectar flow, however, appears static and lacks the authentic gravity-consistent dynamics one would expect in nature.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the trailing vines and blossoms extending from the hummingbird’s tail maintain natural growth patterns, with gradual tapering and evenly spaced flowers, and do they avoid appearing stiff or unnaturally rigid?",
    "explanation": "The trailing vines and blossoms in Image B extend from the hummingbird's tail, with a natural-looking growth pattern. They taper gradually as one would see in actual botanical structures, and the flowers are evenly spaced. The vines do not appear stiff, maintaining an organic flexibility that adds to the realistic portrayal.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the transformed hummingbird cast a shadow consistent with the ambient lighting direction and intensity, and does its overall appearance harmonize with the surrounding garden elements in terms of color temperature and luminosity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed hummingbird does not cast a shadow that matches the ambient lighting direction, which suggests an inconsistency in terms of lighting realism. Moreover, its vivid, high-luminosity colors do not fully harmonize with the more naturally toned garden background, though it adds an artistic contrast.",
    "answer": "No"
