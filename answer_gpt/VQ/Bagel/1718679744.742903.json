      "question": "Does the bold black outline fully trace the crocodile's form without breaking or misaligning at joints, scales, or facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile is presented with a bold black outline that is used to provide a stylized, graphic look. However, upon examining the outline, it seems to adequately trace the contours of the crocodile, including around the head and body without significant breaks or misalignments. This is consistent with the characteristics of a vector or graphic-style illustration where lines are often clean and continuous.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the hat and sunglasses vividly saturated but still preserving visible texture details like knit stitches and lens reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B adopts a very bold and graphic color style, suggesting a reduction in visual detail, typical in highly stylized illustrations. The colors of the hat and sunglasses are indeed vividly saturated, but due to the nature of such graphic styles, texture details such as knit stitches and lens reflections are generally not depicted with fine detail. Instead, the focus is on bold color contrasts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the geometric patterns on the crocodile's skin repeat consistently across the neck, back, and limbs without gaps, overlaps, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile's skin is represented with a simplified, geometric pattern that covers the body uniformly. These patterns are regular and consistent with the typical artistic style where precision in pattern is maintained for a stylized effect. There do not appear to be gaps, overlaps, or distortions in the pattern across different parts of the body.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the hat, sunglasses, and geometric patterns aligned correctly with the crocodile’s head and body, showing no floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the artistic rendering, the components such as the hat and sunglasses appear to be properly aligned with the crocodile’s head. The hat fits over its head, and the sunglasses align as they would anatomically fit over where eyes would presumably be if more realistic. The patterns also follow the contours appropriately. Given these observations, all components seem correctly positioned without appearing to float or misalign.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crocodile’s facial features, including the snout, teeth, and eye placement, proportionally accurate and undistorted despite the artistic modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the crocodile’s facial features along simplified, exaggerated lines due to the graphic style, which might skew realistic proportions slightly. Despite this stylization, the basic structure such as the snout and general head shape appear to be preserved. Thus, while not identical to a realistic portrayal, they maintain an essential proportion consistency within the stylization context.",
