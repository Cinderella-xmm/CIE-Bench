    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed book maintain consistent proportions and structural integrity when opened into a pop-up form, without warped edges or floating components?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the book is transformed into a pop-up form under a glass dome. The edges appear straight, and the structure looks stable without any warping or floating components. The design suggests a consistent transformation where all parts remain proportional, supporting logical conclusions based on visual cues.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the quill positioned centrally and vertically as a stable pivot, with natural feather texture and metallic base that match the original materials?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the quill pens shifted within the dome, maintaining a central position relative to the dome’s orientation. The feather texture looks realistic, and the quill’s base maintains a metallic sheen reminiscent of Image A’s materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Does the inkwell’s transformation into a fountain include realistic water flow and surface reflections without unnatural highlights or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the inkwell within the dome setup, but it does not show any fountain transformation. The surface reflections and inkwell design remain consistent with expected properties without unrealistic highlights or broken geometry, alluding to no fountain feature.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the glass cloche transparent and free of distortion, with smooth curvature and accurate light refraction across all internal elements?",
    "explanation": "The glass cloche in Image B appears transparent with smooth curvature and light refraction. The internal elements of the book and quill are clearly visible without signs of distortion, indicating accurate design implementation concerning light refraction and transparency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the engraved lines on the wooden base continuous, legible, and integrated with the wood texture without sharp breaks or unnatural depth variations?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base shows engraved lines that appear continuous and integrated with the underlying texture. The depth looks naturally consistent without sharp breaks or unnatural variations, indicating thoughtful design adherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
