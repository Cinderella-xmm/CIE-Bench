      "question": "Does the transparent glass material retain the denim blue tint without unnatural color bleeding or inconsistent opacity across the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) features an object resembling a pair of jeans but made of a transparent glass-like material, which maintains a consistent blue tint. The tint is smooth and uniformly distributed across the surface of the 'jeans,' with no visible signs of color bleeding or inconsistent opacity. The design reflects a stylized interpretation of denim, capturing the visual essence without irregularities in color or transparency.",

      "question": "Are the embossed metallic branding elements positioned correctly over the original back pocket area without distorting the surrounding fabric or creating visible seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic branding element is placed near the waistband area. However, it lacks clear reference to the back pocket area since the image's glass material makes the concept of pockets ambiguous. The embossing does not appear to distort the surface around it, but the concept of pockets is not explicitly represented, leading to uncertainty about correct positioning.",

      "question": "Is the silver button-shaped cap properly aligned with the waistband and securely attached without gaps or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a silver button-like cap at the top resembling a waistband area. It is well-aligned and does not display any signs of floating or misalignment. The attachment looks secure and integrated into the design, showing consistency with the garmentâ€™s outline.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the lace-up details on both legs have symmetrical threading and bow knots that follow the natural curve of the leg without distortion or clipping through the fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features lace-up details on both legs that seem to align symmetrically along the glass-like material. The threading and knots follow the curves as intended without visible distortion or clipping through the glass surface. The visual alignment remains consistent with the intended style without visible artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the flared leg section maintain smooth, continuous curvature without sharp breaks, pixelation, or stretched textures indicating geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flared legs of the object in Image B exhibit a smooth and consistent curvature. The design captures the essence of flare jeans, maintaining continuous flow without breaks, pixelation, or texture stretching. The smooth transitions reflect a well-integrated geometric design, maintaining the overall aesthetic coherently.",
