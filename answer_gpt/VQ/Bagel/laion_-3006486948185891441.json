    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the transparent showcase box fully aligned with the horse’s outline and free from visual distortions such as warped edges, double images, or unnatural light refractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The showcase box around the horse appears to follow the horse’s outline without any apparent mismatches or distortions. The edges of the box seem straight and parallel, typical of a well-manufactured display case. There's no evidence of double images or unnatural light refractions in the image, indicating the box is properly aligned and crafted.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the showcase box have uniform color and reflective properties consistent with polished metal, without unnatural highlights or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold accents appear even in color and consistency, reflecting light uniformly as polished metal would. There are no visible signs of color bleeding or random highlights, which supports the notion that the accents are designed to mimic polished metal accurately.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the brand logo clearly legible, properly centered on the black base stand, and free from pixelation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brand logo is visible on the backdrop but not on the base stand. It is detailed and discernible, without signs of pixelation or blurring. The absence of these digital imperfections implies a design that maintains clarity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the internal backdrop pattern follow the correct perspective of the box and avoid warping, tiling errors, or partial cutoffs at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backdrop pattern aligns well with the structural perspective of the box, showing no obvious signs of warping or tiling errors. The print continues uniformly, fitting well within the boundaries of the box without warping or incomplete patterns at the edges.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the magnetic closure mechanism visibly integrated into the box structure without gaps, overlaps, or floating components that suggest mechanical impossibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible closure mechanism seen in the image, and no signs indicating any mechanical impossibility such as gaps or overlaps. Therefore, it implies that the mechanism, if existent, is integrated seamlessly into the box structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all visible parts of the horse sculpture (including the head, legs, saddle, and painted areas) clearly preserved and unobscured by the added packaging elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture is well-displayed, with all major parts visible and unobstructed by the packaging. The showcase design allows a clear view of the sculpture's details such as the horse's head, legs, and saddle, ensuring that no packaging elements obscure these parts.",
