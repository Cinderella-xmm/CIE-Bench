      "question": "Are the edges of the cabin’s roof, walls, and windows clearly defined and geometrically consistent, even with visible brushstrokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the artistic brushstrokes creating a more painterly aesthetic, the edges of the cabin's roof, walls, and windows remain defined and geometrically consistent. The cabin maintains an A-frame structure and vertical walls with rectangular windows, similar to common architectural forms. The brushstrokes enhance the visual texture but do not compromise the recognizability of the cabin’s geometric shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surrounding fir trees maintain their vertical orientation and layered foliage structure despite the use of loose brushwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fir trees are depicted with vibrant colors and dynamic brushstrokes but maintain their upright orientation and layered foliage structure resembling typical coniferous trees. The patterns created by the brushwork mimic the natural arrangement of needles visible in fir trees, ensuring they are recognizable as vertical and structured.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the smoke rise straight upward from the chimney and gradually blur outward, mimicking natural dispersion in cold air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smoke rises from the chimney in a straight line before dispersing outward, reflecting how smoke naturally behaves in the cold air due to thermal effects and wind movement. The brushstrokes contribute to a blurred look, simulating the gradual dissipation of smoke as expected in such conditions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the snow covering the roof, ground, and tree branches uniformly distributed and textured in a way that suggests natural accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses expressive brushstrokes, which create vibrant and varied textures. However, the snow appears less uniformly distributed, with varied hues and strokes that disrupt the appearance of natural accumulation, making it appear stylized rather than naturally textured.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the illuminated windows and string lights along the eaves softly blended into the scene, without harsh outlines or glowing halos that break the stylistic consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows and string lights emit a bright glow that contrasts with the painterly style. The fusion of abstract and bold strokes makes the illumination prominent, with halos and outlines adding radiance that interrupts the stylistic consistency. This contrasts with more subtle artistic blending expected in harmonious visual styles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the foreground elements (small trees, fence) appear closer than the midground cabin and background trees, preserving depth and spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of elements, despite being stylized, maintains spatial logic. The brushwork allows the foreground elements to appear closer, with the cabin in midground and trees in the background, maintaining depth and typical spatial arrangements observed in scenes designed to convey three-dimensional space.",
