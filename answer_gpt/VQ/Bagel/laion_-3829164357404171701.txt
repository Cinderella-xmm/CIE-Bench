    "Question": "Q2: Are the modified gray ribbons shaped into wings with smooth, symmetrical curves and natural fabric draping that match the original material appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gray ribbons have been modified to resemble wings. The modification has maintained smooth, symmetrical curves that give the appearance of wings. While they still resemble fabric in texture, the transformation into wing-like shapes includes blending them seamlessly onto the figure created, but they do not replicate the exact appearance of the original material, serving rather as stylized additions.",

    "explanation": "In the edited image, the white flowers have been visually altered with additional features resembling eyelash-like details. These are incorporated into the design of the object in place of eyes. However, they do not appear as part of standard floral design modifications but are integrated into the artistic transformation that does not maintain the natural shape of actual flowers.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the modified chain forming a continuous, curved tail underneath the bag that retains metallic texture and does not intersect or float above the surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chain from Image A has not been depicted forming a tail-like feature under the bag. The edits have repositioned it as part of the new artistic display, rather than extending it underneath the surface area as described. The chain retains a metallic look but does not extend as a curved tail.",
