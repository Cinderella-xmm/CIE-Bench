    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the text 'Stories Through Time' rendered in a serif font with a distressed gold texture that matches the typewriter’s material and color tone, and does it appear seamlessly integrated into the image without overlapping or obscuring key objects like the typewriter or lamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Stories Through Time' is clearly rendered in a serif font. The distressed gold texture of the text complements the vintage aesthetic of the typewriter, maintaining a similar material and color tone. The placement of the text is above the typewriter and does not overlap with the typewriter or any other key objects, ensuring it is seamlessly integrated into the overall composition of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the sepia filter apply evenly across all elements—such as the wooden desk, typewriter, lamp, and wall—without causing uneven color shifts, loss of texture detail, or artificial flattening of shadows and highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sepia filter in Image B is applied uniformly across various elements including the typewriter, desk, and background. The colors have been adjusted to achieve a cohesive vintage effect, while textures on elements like the desk and typewriter maintain their detail. Shadows and highlights are present and not artificially flattened, reinforcing a consistent depth and texture across the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ghostly pages positioned around the typewriter in a flowing, semi-transparent manner, avoiding sharp edges or unnatural overlaps with solid objects like the typewriter body or desk surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ghostly pages are positioned above and behind the typewriter in a semi-transparent manner. Their edges are smooth and flow naturally, enhancing the ethereal quality without causing any awkward overlaps with solid objects such as the typewriter or desk. This subtle integration contributes to the overall harmonious look of the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Art Deco border present along the edges of the image, featuring symmetrical geometric patterns and consistent thickness, without cutting into or distorting any central elements like the typewriter or lamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes an Art Deco border framing the image's edges. This border features symmetrical geometric patterns, maintaining consistent thickness. It frames the image without encroaching upon or distorting central elements, like the typewriter, allowing these elements to remain the focal point.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the typewriter retain its original shape, alignment of keys, and mechanical structure without visible deformation, stretching, or broken geometry despite the addition of new elements like text and ghostly pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typewriter in Image B retains its original form, with keys correctly aligned and mechanical structures intact. Despite the addition of elements like the text and ghostly pages, the typewriter does not show any signs of deformation, stretching, or broken geometry. This maintains the integrity of the typewriter's design as seen in Image A.",
