      "question": "Are the wooden planks on the walls seamlessly integrated with no visible gaps, misalignment, or unnatural texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden planks appear to be well-integrated into the structure of the house, with no visible gaps or misalignment. The texture of the wood looks natural and convincing, likely because each plank shows a unique pattern, avoiding any unnatural repetition that might occur from copying and pasting textures. This suggests that attention has been paid to blending these elements seamlessly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss texture cover only appropriate surfaces (e.g., lower stone blocks, corners) and appear layered and organic without floating or flat patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moss texture is carefully applied to the base and corners of the house. This suggests an awareness of how moss would naturally accumulate and grow in real-life settings. The moss texture appears layered and three-dimensional, avoiding flat or unrealistic patches and appearing to cling naturally to the surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the roof tiles, walls, and wooden elements uniformly adjusted to earthy tones without inconsistent color gradients or localized discoloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof tiles, walls, and wooden elements have been adjusted to have a cohesive color scheme concentrating on earthy tones, which gives a more realistic and harmonious appearance. The colors are consistent across the entire structure without noticeable discoloration or disjointed gradients, resulting in a natural and uniform presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature characters correctly scaled relative to the house and positioned in plausible locations (e.g., near doors, paths) without floating or intersecting with structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature characters are appropriately scaled in relation to the size of the house. They are positioned logically on the board, with their bases resting on the flat surface, indicating a proper grounding. Their placement near appropriate features like paths further supports their realistic integration into the scene, and they do not appear to float or intersect with any part of the structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the parchment board positioned flat on the ground with realistic folds, texture, and shadow alignment matching the light source direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parchment board appears flat and integrated into the scene, as it is aligned parallel to the ground. The texture of the board features slight folds and aging that are consistent with how parchment would naturally behave. Shadow placement is consistent with the light source, enhancing its realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the rule booklets have consistent page thickness, visible spine details, and shadows that align with the lighting and surface they rest on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any rule booklets to assess. Therefore, this analysis is not applicable to the visible elements within the scene. This question pertains to elements not present in the edited image.",
