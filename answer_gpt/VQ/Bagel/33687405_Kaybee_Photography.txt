    "Question": "Q2: Are the stat bars positioned in a way that does not obscure key facial features or clothing details and appear visually coherent with the overall composition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stat bars are strategically placed in the lower portion of the image as if part of a card design, thereby not interfering with salient features of the clothing, such as the vest and its beadwork. This placement ensures that the key visual elements remain unobstructed, allowing the viewer to appreciate the design fully without conflict between visual components.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the gold-etched nameplate free from exaggerated glares or inconsistent surface reflections, and does it maintain a uniform thickness and edge definition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold-etched nameplate maintains a uniform thickness and shows well-defined edges with quality, realistic detailing. The reflective quality is managed well, meaning there are no exaggerated distractions from surface reflections that would compromise the design aesthetic. Thus, these factors reflect careful design with attention to realism and detail.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are the geometric tribal motifs along the border continuous, symmetrical, and free from gaps or distorted angles that suggest poor rendering?",
    "explanation": "The border in Image B features geometric tribal motifs that exhibit continuity and symmetry, sealing the card's design harmoniously. These motifs show no visible gaps nor distorted angles, signifying a well-rendered design. This observation is informed by assessing the regularity and completeness of patterns around the border as compared to a high-quality rendering standard.",
    "answer": "Yes"
