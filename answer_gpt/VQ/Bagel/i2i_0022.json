      "question": "Does the cat’s curled-up posture in the chibi illustration match the original position on the car hood and maintain structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi illustration portrays the cat as curled up, which is a common position for cats to take. This posture is recognizable as a typical curled-up sleeping position on a flat surface. In Image A, the cat on the car hood is curled up, sleeping comfortably. The position in Image B retains this structural consistency of the curled posture, making it visually coherent and recognizable as the same position even in stylized art.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gradient color blocks used to depict the cat’s fur smooth and free from unnatural textures or color blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's fur is stylized with gradient color blocks that create a smooth transition between different shades. These gradients represent the varied colors of a typical cat's fur, using smooth color transitions which are stylized but free from unnatural textures or harsh color blocks. The original image, Image A, shows a more detailed and textured fur pattern, characteristic of real fur. The transformation in Image B is simplified for artistic effect while remaining smooth.",

      "question": "Does the car appear as a curved surface with reflection lines only, maintaining its structural integrity and avoiding obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is simplified and stylized to resemble a platform-like surface for the cat illustration. The reflections are stylized with lines to suggest a reflective surface, consistent with typical representations of shiny surfaces in art. Image A shows the real car hood, with reflections and curves that match its physical construction. In both images, the surface appears coherent with the chibi illustration avoiding any distortions or artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sticker outlined with a thick white line and does it have a transparent background, retaining the visual coherence of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the cat illustration as a sticker or decal, surrounded by a thick white line which is typical of sticker designs to define their border. The background is transparent, ensuring it can visually be pasted onto any surface without compromising the scene's coherence. This form matches common sticker designs. Image A does not feature a sticker but shows the real cat on a car hood. The sticker presentation in Image B does not disrupt the scene's visual balance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have any unnatural textures been introduced, or have key details of the cat and car been lost in the chibi illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi illustration simplifies the details of the cat and the car to achieve a stylized effect typical of graphic stickers. The cat's fur, while less detailed than Image A, is not rendered with unnatural textures, and the posture is clearly defined. Similarly, the car surface is abstracted to a basic reflective platform for artistic purposes. The transformation retains key recognizable features without introducing unnatural textures, focusing on simplicity rather than loss of key details.",
