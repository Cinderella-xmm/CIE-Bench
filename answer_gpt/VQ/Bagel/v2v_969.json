      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D figures inside the snow globe maintain the correct proportions and avoid unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the chibi-style figures appear consistent with typical design proportionsâ€”large heads and small bodies. This stylization aligns with common chibi design principles that emphasize exaggerated features without distortion. The proportions of the figures do not seem unnatural, maintaining the form and aspect typically associated with such collectibles.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow inside the globe appears as a subtle dusting, which is typical for decorative snow globes to simulate snowfall. The texture does not show evident artifacts nor does it interfere with the visual of the grass, presenting a believable winter scene. Such realistic depiction aligns with common aesthetics of miniature snow displays.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe rest naturally on the rustic wooden shelf with soft sunlight filtering through, creating believable warm, golden reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe is placed on what seems like a rustic wooden surface with lighting that casts a soft, warm glow typical of sunlight filtering through. The reflections on the glass surface of the globe give an impression of realism and warmth, aligning with a typical environmental setting where natural sunlight adds to the aesthetic of the scene.",

      "question": "Are the bats propped against the fence inside the snow globe depicted with natural textures and shapes, avoiding any distortion or unnatural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the bats held by the figures inside the globe appear straight and correctly proportioned, maintaining a natural appearance without any visible distortion. They are depicted with consistent textures that one would expect from small plastic or wooden replicas, creating a valid representation in line with miniature baseball settings.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the interior scene of the snow globe and the vintage baseball clubhouse backdrop smooth, without any visible artifacts or breaks in continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon evaluating Image B, the transition from the interior base of mini figures to the background baseball clubhouse scene inside the globe is smooth, as the image demonstrates no distinct artifacts or sharp breaks. This transition is visually coherent, maintaining continuity, which contributes to the overall aesthetic appearance of the snow globe.",
