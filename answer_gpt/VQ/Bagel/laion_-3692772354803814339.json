      "question": "Are the swirling ocean wave patterns inside the crystal bottle smooth, continuous, and free of jagged edges or unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual examination of the edited image shows a carefully crafted wave pattern with smooth and flowing lines, typical of an artistic representation of a swirling ocean inside a glass bottle. It does not show any jagged edges or unnatural distortions, as the design is intended to give a natural and artistic oceanic feel. The waves appear fluid and uninterrupted, reflecting the artist's intent for graceful motion, which suggests a well-rendered image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the golden maritime symbols on the bottle label occupy the correct area, maintain sharp edges, and show no signs of pixelation or smudging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden maritime symbols are clearly rendered with intricate details and appear to maintain sharp edges. There is no visible pixelation or smudging, which indicates that the image quality is high. The symbols are precisely placed and clearly distinguishable, which suggests that they occupy the correct area on the bottle's surface.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the compass rose at the top of the packaging have evenly spaced metallic points with realistic reflections and no misalignment or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The compass rose features visible metallic points that are evenly spaced, and the reflections suggest a realistic metal-like texture. There are no signs of misalignment or clipping artifacts, which would have appeared as misaligned edges or abrupt cut-offs in the design. The compass maintains its expected geometric precision, indicating a high-quality rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition from the bottle neck to the wave-patterned body seamless, with no abrupt breaks or geometric deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition between the bottle neck and the wave-patterned body appears smooth and continuous without any abrupt changes or visible geometric deformations. The design flows naturally from the neck down into the wave pattern, maintaining the integrity of the crystal bottle's artistic design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the parchment surface of the packaging display consistent aging texture without artificial streaks or uneven shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parchment surface on the packaging is intended to evoke an aged appearance. The texture appears consistent across the surface, with no noticeable artificial streaks or uneven shading that would disrupt the natural look of aged parchment. The use of consistent tone and texture further supports the authenticity of the aging effect.",
