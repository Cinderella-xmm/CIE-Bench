      "question": "Are the gorilla's hands holding the bananas with five fingers each, and do the fingers have natural curvature and skin texture without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla is holding a bunch of bananas. The visual inspection shows that each hand has five fingers, and the fingers display natural curvature with realistic skin texture which suggests realism in the depiction of the gorilla's hands. This conclusion is based on the visible details such as the knuckles and natural bends of the fingers, which are typical attributes of a gorilla's hand.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cereal box integrated with the gorilla and background of a jungle. The blending appears smooth without any visible seams or harsh lines, and there are no abrupt changes in lighting where the box meets the surrounding elements. This suggests that the edge of the box is blended well.",

      "question": "Are the green and yellow colors on the cereal box consistent with the lighting and tone of the jungle environment, without abrupt shifts or oversaturated patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cereal box in Image B contains green and yellow colors that align with the jungle setting. The colors seem consistent with the tones found in the jungle background, and there are no regions that appear oversaturated or jarring. The visual harmony between these colors and the environment suggests a coherent color scheme.",

      "question": "Do the banana motifs and leaf patterns on the box have realistic shadows and depth, matching the lighting direction of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana motifs and leaf patterns on the cereal box show consistent lighting and shadows that mirror the direction of the light in the scene. These elements have realistic depth, which suggests that the decorations on the box are designed with attention to the angle of lighting, giving them a natural appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The back panel in Image B features an illustration where the perspective and scale appear consistent with the overall design. The text is placed in such a way that it does not obscure significant parts of the image, including the gorillas or bananas. This indicates appropriate arrangement and readability of the text within the scene.",
