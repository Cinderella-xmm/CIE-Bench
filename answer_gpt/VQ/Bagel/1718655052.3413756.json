    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the wood-carved hat and scarf clearly distinguishable from the original fabric textures, with consistent grain patterns and engraved details that follow natural wood structure without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and scarf have been transformed into a wood-carved style. The wood grain patterns and engraved details are consistent with what we'd expect from a natural wooden structure - they exhibit the texture and pattern typical of wood, suggesting a skilled transformation from fabric to wood while maintaining realism. There are no distortions in the patterns that would indicate a poor transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks form a continuous, anatomically plausible layer over the dog’s body without gaps, overlapping inconsistencies, or floating pieces that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks are arranged in such a way that they form a logical and continuous covering over the dog's body. The structure of LEGO typically involves interlocking pieces that fit together without gaps. The image shows a neat arrangement of bricks without noticeable spacing issues, and there are no floating pieces, suggesting a coherent and logical assembly.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the light-colored wooden tabletop background evenly lit and seamlessly integrated with the subject, without abrupt transitions or shadow mismatches that suggest poor compositing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears to be a light-colored wooden tabletop. It is evenly lit and does not exhibit harsh transitions or shadow mismatches between the table and the dog figure, indicating successful integration. The lighting is consistent across the scene, enhancing the believable placement of the dog on the tabletop.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ear flaps of the wood-carved hat properly shaped and positioned symmetrically on both sides of the dog’s head, without deformation or disproportionate scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ear flaps are symmetrically positioned on either side of the dog's head. They are carved with precision, and there is no evident deformation or disproportionate scaling. The symmetry and appropriate styling give a balanced look to the image, consistent with traditional woodcraft techniques.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks exhibit consistent edge definition, proper shading, and logical placement across the dog’s body, avoiding blocky artifacts or color clumps that break visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows LEGO bricks with well-defined edges and logical placement. The shading on these bricks aligns with how real LEGO pieces look under light, enhancing their three-dimensional appearance. The arrangement avoids artifacts or color clumps that could detract from the realism, maintaining visual continuity across the figure.",
