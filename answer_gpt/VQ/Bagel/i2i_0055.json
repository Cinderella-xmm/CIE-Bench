      "question": "Does the cartoon transformation of the baby elephant maintain natural proportions without any noticeable distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon baby elephant is displayed with typically exaggerated features that are characteristic of cartoon art, such as a large head and big eyes, enhancing its cuteness. These features are consistent with common cartoon styling and not considered distortion when viewed as a cartoon. Therefore, the proportions are intentionally designed to be cute and appealing, rather than realistic, but they do not exhibit any noticeable distortion beyond this stylistic choice.",
