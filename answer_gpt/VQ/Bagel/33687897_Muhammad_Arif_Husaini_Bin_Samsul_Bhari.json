      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the stone-like texture applied to the mountain's surface exhibit uniformity and natural variation in roughness, without visible artifacts like repeating patterns or abrupt transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stone-like texture on the mountain's surface should ideally mimic natural stone, displaying subtle variations in roughness that provide authenticity. However, in Image B, the stone surface displays a uniform pattern with stylized, unnatural features such as glowing eyes and glowing veins. Artifacts like these introduce abrupt transitions not typically found in natural stone formations, leading to a non-uniform appearance. Thus, the texture does not exhibit natural variation in roughness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the rock-carved eyes positioned symmetrically and proportionally on the mountain’s peak, with realistic depth and integration into the terrain, avoiding floating or misplaced features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are designed as glowing features that are not naturally part of the terrain. They appear across the upper part of the structure, aiming for symmetry; however, their illumination and artistry suggest that they are not traditionally integrated into the rock's depth or terrain, as they don't conform to what would naturally be carved into a mountain. The glow further accentuates their separation from the terrain.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wing-like ridges extend from the mountain’s sides in a way that follows natural geological lines and does not introduce sharp, broken, or impossible angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the wing-like structures extending from the main body of the mountain-like figure are designed with an organic flow, resembling extended limbs rather than geological ridges. While creative, they do not resemble natural geological formations due to pronounced and sharp angles that don't follow the continuity seen in mountain erosion or formation lines, creating a sense of surreal artificiality.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the limbs of the creature integrated with the tree silhouettes in a way that avoids visual conflicts such as overlapping branches appearing behind solid limbs or disconnected joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's limbs intermingle with the tree silhouettes. However, rather than appearing naturally integrated, there are instances where branches and limbs overlap in non-realistic ways, such as branches appearing to exist independently of the limb positioning and joint articulation not reflecting the natural bends or joints in such limbs. This leads to visual conflicts, where elements fail to blend seamlessly with one another.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the luminous veins emit a soft glow that blends with the blue and pink hues of the sky, without creating bright halos, sharp edges, or overexposed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminous veins on the creature in Image B emit a distinct glow. However, instead of blending softly into the sky, they create sharp contrasts against the softer background hues of blue and pink sky. This results in noticeable, sharp edges and bright areas that disrupt the more muted background, implying a level of overexposure that detracts from a seamless blend.",
