      "question": "Are the added cogs and gears on the lamp's armature properly aligned with the existing structure, maintaining consistent proportions and smooth transitions without visible seams or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a lamp embedded with various cogs and gears extending along its armature. In analyzing the added elements, the cogs appear integrated without visible seams or texture mismatches. Their proportions align well with the mechanical arm's structure, suggesting a deliberate design choice that supports the armature's aesthetic and functional continuity. Such additions merge seamlessly by utilizing a consistent metallic texture and color scheme with the arm, providing a cohesive visual effect.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the page edges of the open book display cog-like patterns that are integrated seamlessly into the paper texture without distorting the natural curl or layering of the pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the open book's page edges with cog-like designs porting into the paper texture. The alterations and added mechanical designs don't interfere with the natural curl and layering of the pages, as they maintain consistent shadows and textures, reflecting careful integration into the book's structural design without causing distortions. Consequently, the effect on pattern is realistic, preserving the bookâ€™s natural appearance while accentuating it with added detailing.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rivet patterns applied to the floral wallpaper evenly spaced and dimensionally consistent with the wall surface, without causing distortions in the flower shapes or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This question is interpreted considering a mechanical theme alteration. Image A's wallpaper is adorned with floral designs, not rivets. Image B lacks any floral wallpaper; instead, it uses cog and gear decoration on a different texture. Therefore, the question deviates from Image B's design. Additionally, the absence of visible distortions or inconsistencies in Image B affirms no influence on floral patterns or shadows.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the color tone of the edited elements (lamp, books, wallpaper) consistent with the original warm vintage palette, showing no abrupt shifts in hue or brightness that disrupt visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the color palette aligns closely with the mechanical-industrial theme, different from the original vintage palette in Image A. The edited image embraces a steampunk atmosphere with hues that interplay with metallic and brown shades. Despite not matching the vintage hue in Image A, the tonal consistency in Image B is harmonized with its unique theme, shifting yet coherently complementing the visual construction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the mechanical additions (cogs, gears, rivets) proportionally scaled and structurally anchored to existing surfaces, avoiding floating or misaligned components that break spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B integrates cogs and gears into the lamp's design, with careful spatial logic keeping these additions proportionally scaled and structurally anchored to the surfaces. The components are meticulously aligned demonstrating consolidation with the mechanical design space, avoiding irregular or floating appearances. This integration maintains spatial coherence, respecting the design logic.",
