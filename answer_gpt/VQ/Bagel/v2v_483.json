      "question": "Does the man's face maintain natural proportions and avoid distortion after being converted into a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a 3D cartoon style presentation. In general, converting a realistic image into a 3D cartoon style often involves adjusting proportions to give a stylized appearance. The man's proportions seem consistent with typical 3D caricature styling, where characteristics are exaggerated while maintaining recognition. It does not exhibit unnatural distortion that would be noticeable or unusual within the context of a cartoon style.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the fan has been transformed into a simplified cartoon style. Cartoon representations inherently reduce complexity, leading to smoother surfaces and fewer details compared to real life. The hand's texture appears consistent with general cartoon styles, without noticeable artifacts disrupting the overall image. The conversion has maintained a clean appearance that aligns with typical cartoon aesthetics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the fan is represented in a cartoon style that closely mirrors its position and appearance in the original image. While details are simplified, the fan interacts with the environment by maintaining visual consistency with the 3D cartoon surroundings, such as maintaining its position relative to the character and having a recognizable shape. There are no visible artifacts or distortions introduced in this cartoonized environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The birthday cake and candles have been depicted in a stylized cartoon format. The image shows the cake with visible cartoonish texture and distinct, colorful candles. The transition to a cartoon style has preserved the primary features and arrangement from the original image, avoiding any visible artifacts or awkward alterations. They appear natural within the context of the overall cartoon scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The festive-themed backdrop includes balloons that, while cartoonized, fit well with the overall style and theme of the edited image. The candles, presented within the cartoon cake, are consistent in style and color with the rest of the image. Both the balloons and candles integrate harmoniously, adding to the festive ambience without disrupting the scene's authenticity and cohesiveness.",
