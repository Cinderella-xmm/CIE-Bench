      "question": "Does the chibi character maintain the same pose and clothing details as the original image without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character's pose is much more simplified and cartoonish compared to the original image in Image A. In the original image, the person is in a Tai Chi pose, which is dynamic and complex. In contrast, the chibi character in Image B is seated and holding its hands up, a posture not present in Image A. Given these differences, it is evident that the pose and details have been changed considerably, which leads to distortions in comparison to the original.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and fine details of the chibi character's clothing and skin natural and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture and details of the chibi character's clothing and skin are highly stylized and simplified, typical of a cartoon or 3D character design. The original image likely had more realistic textures, with fine details that are natural for human skin and fabric. The chibi character's appearance does not reflect these natural textures, focusing instead on smooth surfaces and minimal detail. This inconsistency indicates that the textures do not match the realism expected.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi character's hands and legs match the original image without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character in Image B shows exaggerated proportions, which are characteristic of chibi style â€” large head, small body, and disproportionately bigger hands in relation to the rest of the body. The original image likely depicts a person with realistic human proportions. Therefore, the proportions of the chibi character do not match the realistic and rational proportions expected in a human figure, indicating a distortion.",

      "question": "Does the placement of the chibi character sitting on the edge of the Instagram frame look natural and visually plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character appears to be interacting with an Instagram frame with its legs hanging over the edge. This seating arrangement appears logical and spatially coherent within the context of the cartoon environment, suggesting intentional design rather than an unnatural placement. The placement seems visually plausible given the style and dimensions of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the social media icons and the username \"Graceful\" integrated seamlessly into the scene without disrupting the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The social media icons and the username 'Graceful' in Image B are part of the Instagram frame design around the chibi character. They are presented in a consistent style that matches the rest of the scene, suggesting an attempt to create a unified and seamless visual theme. The elements appear as intended and do not disrupt the natural appearance of this stylized, cartoon scene.",
