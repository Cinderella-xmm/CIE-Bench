    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the magnifying glass placed among the books on the left bookshelf visually consistent in size, shape, and material, with a shadow extending toward the desk that matches the lighting direction from the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the magnifying glass appears prominently near the center of the desk without a visible shadow. The lighting appears to originate from the window behind, casting shadows from elements on the desk onto the floor. The lack of a shadow from the magnifying glass indicates it does not align with the existing lighting direction seen in the image, making the setup visually inconsistent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the ghostly outline of the detective in a trench coat appear as a translucent, softly blended form within the stained-glass window pattern, maintaining the integrity of the original design and showing no jagged edges or inconsistent opacity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outline of the detective is noticeably solid with a defined silhouette that partially obscures the stained-glass window pattern. The edges are crisp rather than softly blended, which creates a distinct separation from the background window design rather than appearing translucent and integrated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the deep sepia tones applied consistently across all surfaces including the wooden desk, bookshelves, floor, and window, preserving fine details like wood grain and book spines without introducing blotchy or uneven color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features consistent sepia tones across different surfaces, providing a warm and cohesive look. The details on the wooden desk, bookshelves, and floor are preserved without visibly blotchy patches or uneven color spreads, maintaining the texture and visual richness of the elements depicted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the title \"The Lost Legacy\" positioned at the top of the image in a bold serif font that is clearly legible, proportionally scaled, and seamlessly overlaid without obscuring the ceiling details or causing visual disruption to the surrounding ornate patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'The Lost Legacy' is placed prominently at the top. The font is bold and serif, and it fits proportionally within the space without overlapping ceiling details or causing disruption to engraved patterns, ensuring readability and visual harmony.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the added elements—the magnifying glass and the ghostly figure—integrate seamlessly into the scene without distorting adjacent objects, altering lighting logic, or introducing visible artifacts such as misaligned edges or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the magnifying glass and detective figure are added in a way that does not integrate naturally into the scene. The magnifying glass lacks a consistent shadow that should follow the desk's lighting logic, and the detective figure interrupts the window's design with harsh edges. These added elements introduce a visual discrepancy, impacting seamless integration.",
