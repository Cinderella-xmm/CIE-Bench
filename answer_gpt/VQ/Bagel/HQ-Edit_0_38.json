      "question": "Do the golden highlights on the grape clusters follow the natural curvature and lighting direction of the grapes without appearing as separate, overlaid patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden highlights on the grape clusters are analyzed. The highlights appear to blend naturally with the grapes, following their curvature and lighting direction, reflecting realistic light interaction. This prevents the highlights from appearing as separate or overlaid patches, thus ensuring visual coherence with the grapes in the scene.",

      "question": "Does the twisted vine design of the cane maintain smooth, continuous curves and proportional thickness consistent with a natural vine, without sharp breaks or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cane in Image B is examined for its vine design. It exhibits smooth, continuous curves and maintains a proportional thickness, mimicking the appearance of a natural vine. This consistency in design ensures there are no sharp breaks or irregularities, contributing to a coherent and authentic feel of the object.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornate filigree details are analyzed against the suit's fabric. The integration appears seamless, as the filigree aligns with and complements the existing weave pattern without any disruption due to visible outlines or layering artifacts. This ensures the fabric retains a clean and cohesive look.",
