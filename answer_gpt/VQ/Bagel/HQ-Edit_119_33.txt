The Art Nouveau aesthetic often prioritizes flowing lines and large, simple forms over fine detailing. Therefore, while clarity is maintained in design outlines, the detailed texture typical of realistic representation is not present, particularly with simplification in the stylized areas like the sunflower centers and hair. As Art Nouveau involves abstraction with bold lines, the details are enhanced through line work but not through minute texture, which differs from realistic detailing.",
