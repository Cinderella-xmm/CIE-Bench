      "question": "Are the chibi versions of Ultraman and the creature proportionally scaled with rounded, simplified features that maintain their identifiable characteristics without distorted limbs or facial structures?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts chibi versions of Ultraman and the creature inside a snow globe. Chibi art style typically features characters with an exaggerated head-to-body ratio while simplifying details. The figures maintain recognizable features; Ultraman has a blue circular element on his chest, and the creature has large eyes and a wide grin, which are consistent with their usual depictions, albeit in a cute form. Their limbs and facial features appear rounded and without distortion.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of Image Bâ€™s snow globe has a texturized surface that resembles rugged terrain and metallic debris compatible with the scale of chibi figures.
