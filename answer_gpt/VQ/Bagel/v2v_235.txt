    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D chibi rendition of the dancer maintain natural proportions without introducing any unnatural geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi dancer has exaggerated features typical of chibi art. This style intentionally uses disproportionate body parts, often with larger heads and smaller bodies, to create a cute appearance. Thus, while the style itself is intended to be distorted compared to realistic human proportions, it does not imply a deviation from the chibi art style's norms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the glowing elliptical portal visually credible, with no obvious artifacts where it meets the realistic dance studio environment?",
    "explanation": "The portal in Image B has a smooth gradient and transitions well into the environment. The surrounding environment complements the portal's visual cues, with soft illumination matching the portal's glow, enhancing its believability and integration into the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the dancer's hand extending towards the viewer retain natural textures and details, with no more than five fingers visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi dancer's hand is stylized, consistent with chibi art, which often simplifies anatomical details. Despite the simplification, the hand appears to have the correct number of fingers — five — and maintains a coherent texture suitable for this art style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the spotlight effects in the grayscale 3D chibi world consistent with the dancer's pose, contributing to a natural and visually plausible scene?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a colored environment with soft lighting rather than a grayscale world. The spotlight effect isn't clearly observed, but the lighting enhances the 3D feel of the portal and dancer, making the scene visually cohesive. However, since the scene isn't grayscale as the question implies, the spotlight's role is more atmospheric than directional.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the composition adhere to the 2:3 aspect ratio, with the dancer and portal positioned in a balanced manner that enhances visual credibility?",
    "explanation": "Image B seems to maintain a square format rather than a 2:3 aspect ratio. The dancer and portal are centrally positioned, providing a balanced composition within the frame, but this does not correspond to a 2:3 aspect ratio. Therefore, while the balance is achieved, the aspect ratio criterion is not met.",
    "answer": "No"
