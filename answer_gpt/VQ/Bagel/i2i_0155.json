      "question": "Does the addition of 'Breathe' at the top left corner blend naturally with the image without introducing any visible artifacts or disrupting the plant's structural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Breathe' is added to the top left corner. Analyzing Image B without considering Image A, the text appears to be distinctly separate from the plant, with enough space around it to avoid affecting the structural appearance of the plant itself. The color and placement seem deliberate and complement the image's aesthetic, creating no disturbances or artifacts in the visual presentation of the plant. Comparing Image A, the absence of text makes the green of the leaves slightly more dominant, but the addition in Image B is visually smooth and doesn't detract from the focus on the plant.",

      "question": "Is the inclusion of 'Calm' at the bottom right corner naturally integrated into the scene, ensuring that the window frame's geometry remains intact and visually plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, 'Calm' is placed at the bottom right corner. Observing Image B, the text 'Calm' is added in an area that does not overlap the rim or geometry of the actual window frame, focusing instead on an open space at the bottom of the image. The font and color scheme complements the existing lighting and aesthetics, allowing the window frame to remain visually intact and unobstructed. Comparing with Image A, the text inclusion in Image B does not alter or interfere with the spatial elements or symmetry of the window itself.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the light reflections and shadows on the leaves natural and consistent with the lighting source, unaffected by the added text 'Breathe' and 'Calm'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a plant with leaves reflecting light consistent with a natural lighting source, unchanged by the text 'Breathe' and 'Calm.' The text addition doesn't interfere with the shadows or reflections on the leaves, retaining their authenticity which suggests good integration of text without altering existing details. Comparing Image A, both images maintain the same consistent lighting on the plant, with no inconsistencies introduced by the added text.",

      "question": "Do the texture details of the terracotta pot and its saucer remain authentic and detailed, with no degradation or introduction of unnatural textures due to the addition of text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the terracotta pot and saucer exhibit consistent texture details and authenticity, unaffected by the 'Breathe' and 'Calm' text additions. The pot's surfaces remain smooth, with a natural gradient of lighting and color unaffected by surrounding elements, including added text. Comparing with Image A, the texture remains equally clear and realistic, showing no degradation or introduction of unnatural textures.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the positioning of 'Breathe' and 'Calm' preserved the plant's form and the window's symmetry, avoiding any distortion or disruption in proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of 'Breathe' and 'Calm' appears strategic and intentional, avoiding any distortion to the plant's form or the window's symmetry. The text occupies spaces away from the center, focusing on areas where they do not disrupt proportions or symmetry. Comparing with Image A, Image B retains the original symmetrical form of the plant and window, suggesting a careful addition that preserves the intended spatial balance without distortion.",
