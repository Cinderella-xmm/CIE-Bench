      "question": "Do the exaggerated muscles on the athleteâ€™s arms, shoulders, and abdomen follow natural anatomical contours without introducing unnatural bulges or broken shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the athlete's muscles are illustrated in an exaggerated manner typical of comic art styles, focusing on enhancing muscle definition and size. However, the representation does not break anatomical logic; each muscle group flows naturally into the next, adhering to typical human anatomy, though exaggerated.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gloves have a uniform color and texture, consistent with comic art styles. The highlights and accents are consistent with the light sources depicted, and there is no pixelation or unnatural seams visible. The cartoonish rendering supports a consistent style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the strobe lights in the background evenly distributed and consistent in direction and intensity, without creating unnatural shadows or light leaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the strobe lights appear as stylized, colorful lines in the background. The orientation and intensity of these lights are consistent with the overall comic style, maintaining a uniform direction and avoiding the creation of unrealistic shadows or light leaks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blank motivational quote panel aligned with the perspective of the scene and does it have consistent lighting and shadowing to appear as if part of the environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The quote panels in Image B are designed as part of the comic strips. The alignment and placement appear consistent with the frame's layout, but they do not integrate with lighting effects due to their unique function as text areas. However, their position does not detract from the coherence of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition maintains balance by focusing on the athlete's posture and attributes, such as the gloves and stance, which remain clear. The guarded cropping and stylized elements allow the image to remain detailed and distinguishable when scaled for print.",
