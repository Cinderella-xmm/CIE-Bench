      "question": "Are the edges of the cat’s body defined by clear, continuous, and uniform bold lines that follow its natural silhouette without distortion or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's body is outlined with bold, uniform black lines, which suggest a cartoon or graphic style. These lines are continuous and follow the natural silhouette of the cat without any distortion or gaps. The use of such lines is common in cartoon illustrations to emphasize shapes and simplify forms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the color of the sunglasses uniformly flat orange without any reflection, gradient, or texture, and does it maintain the original shape and position on the cat’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses on the cat are depicted with a single flat orange color, lacking any reflection, gradient, or texture. This creates a simplified and stylized look. The shape and position of the sunglasses are consistent with their original placement in Image A, maintaining continuity in the depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the beach background been converted into solid, non-blended color blocks for the sky, ocean, and sand, with no visible texture or natural gradient transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background comprising the sky, ocean, and sand is rendered in solid color blocks. There are no visible textures or gradient transitions present, which deviates from the realistic depiction in Image A. This visual choice enhances the graphic or pop-art style by using distinct, non-blended colors.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the harness depicted using a smooth gradient fill instead of realistic fabric texture, and are the shadows under the cat composed of gradient colors rather than natural light-based shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the harness is shown in flat colors without any realistic fabric texture detail. The shadows under the cat, along with other shadows, are depicted using simplified gradient colors instead of natural, light-based shading. This alteration gives the image a more digital and stylized appearance, aligning with graphic art styles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all major elements in the image—including the cat, sunglasses, hot dog, and background—rendered exclusively in red, blue, or yellow, with no other colors present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the major elements such as the cat, sunglasses, hot dog, and background are primarily rendered in red, blue, and yellow. These primary colors dominate the image and are characteristic of pop-art styles. No other colors are present, which demonstrates a reductionist color scheme exclusive to these three hues.",
