      "question": "Are the floral patterns and lace overlay smoothly blended into the gown without visible seams or unnatural texture disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns and lace overlay visually blend with the gown, creating a seamless appearance. The flowers are incorporated into the background design, showing no visible seams or texture disruptions that would indicate poor integration. This smooth blending indicates a thoughtful design process that respects the gown's aesthetic. In comparison to Image A, the incorporation of lace is even further emphasized by the floral elements, but no new seams or disruptions have been introduced. Therefore, the edited image maintains a smooth and harmonious integration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hand show five fingers with natural positioning and no deformation, and is the bouquet held in a physically plausible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the bouquet shows five fingers with a natural positioning, indicating normal human hand anatomy. The fingers wrap around the bouquet stems plausibly, suggesting a realistic grip. The bouquet is held in a manner that one would typically expect when grasping flowers, making this pose both physically and visually plausible. Comparing to Image A, the hand seems similarly natural and well-positioned, maintaining consistent realism in both images.",

      "question": "Are the watercolor effects evenly distributed without obscuring facial features, dress details, or creating harsh color boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, watercolor effects are used creatively to enhance the overall elegance without overtaking main elements like facial features, or clear dress details. The effects are dispersed around the figure, adding to the background without causing harsh color boundaries. The dress details remain clear and the visual presentation stays harmonious. Compared to Image A, the watercolor effects add an artistic touch without compromising visibility and coherence of the main subject.",

      "question": "Are the embossed edges consistently applied around the image, and is the paper sleeve positioned without overlapping or distorting the main subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features embossed edges that complement the artistic design, applied consistently around the image, providing a framed artwork look without interfering with the main subject. The paper sleeve serves as a border and none of the edges overlap or distort the figure. Compared to Image A, the embossed edges add another layer to the presentation without misplacing the subject.",

      "question": "Is the veil still attached correctly to the head, the floral crown intact and properly positioned, and the dress silhouette preserved without warping or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the veil is properly attached to the head, showing continuity from the crown. The floral crown remains intact and correctly positioned, ensuring the headpiece contributes to the elegant aesthetic without misalignment. Additionally, the dress silhouette is preserved accurately, showing no signs of warping or distortion which indicates a careful editing process. Image A confirms that these elements have been retained well in the edited version, maintaining the structure and integrity of the original design.",
