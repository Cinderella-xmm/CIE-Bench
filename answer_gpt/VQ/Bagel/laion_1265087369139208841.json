      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the crystal orb surrounding the castle have clean, unbroken edges without visible distortion or bending of the castle’s structure inside it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orb is consistently rounded with no visible distortions, maintaining the integrity of the castle’s structure within it. The edges of the orb appear smooth and clean, indicating no distortion or bending effects are present. The depiction follows familiar stylistic portrayals of crystal balls or snow globes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the clouds positioned above the castle without overlapping or clipping through any architectural elements, and do they have soft, natural-looking edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are situated within the orb and positioned above the castle without intersecting or overlapping architectural elements. The edges of the clouds appear soft and fluffy, consistent with how clouds typically look in illustrations; they do not interfere with the structural aspects of the castle.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vines climb the castle walls from the bottom upward, following the wall contours without breaking the stone texture or appearing to float in mid-air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, vines are seen climbing from the base towards the top of the castle walls. They appear to follow the contours of the stone structure closely, integrating well with the castle surface. There is no indication of floating, as the foliage seems to be naturally attached to the wall, maintaining structural coherence and realism.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gem-like flowers placed within the garden beds at a natural scale, with no excessive glare or repeating textures that indicate artificial rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers, stylized to appear gem-like, are situated within the designed garden area of the orb display. They are proportionately scaled and harmonize with surrounding decorative elements. While they are bright and colorful, consistent with decorative pieces like a snow globe or miniature display, the light effects appear intentional rather than excessive glare.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dragon positioned on a stable part of the central tower, proportionally small compared to the structure, and casting a shadow aligned with the ambient light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon sits atop one of the central turrets, maintaining a scale that is small relative to the castle structure, which is typical in miniature or decorative designs. The positioning is stable and appropriate for the structure's architecture, with shadow consistency matching the ambient lighting depicted in the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the gold base lie flush with the ground, extend evenly under the castle, and show consistent engraved patterns without jagged edges or texture errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold base appears to be even and flush where it meets the surrounding base structure of the orb. The engraved patterns exhibit consistent design and execution, typical for decorative ornaments. There are no visible texture errors or marking inconsistencies, indicating a high-quality finish.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all added elements (orb, clouds, vines, dragon, flowers, base) structurally coherent with the original castle, showing no broken lines, floating components, or conflicting lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the additional elements like the orb, clouds, dragon, and vines are integrated well with the original castle structure. There are no visible broken lines or floating components. Each element matches the overall ambient lighting, maintaining a uniform visual coherence within this fantastical depiction.",
