    "Question": "Q1: Are the cogwheel joints clearly defined, aligned with the frame's geometry, and rendered with consistent metallic texture and shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cogwheel joints must show detailed and intricate design work consistent with a mechanical aesthetic. The alignment should follow logic, maintaining a balance and symmetry with other mechanical parts. The metallic texture should have highlights and shadows to convey a three-dimensional look. The overall rendering should feel cohesive, reflecting a metallic object rather than a flat one.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the carapace-shaped seat have detailed surface textures, proper curvature, and seamless attachment to the seat post without visible seams or warping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the seat appears as a part of the insect-like arrangement. It should have a continuous surface with textures that give it a realistic look, mimicking a natural curve found in biological exoskeletons. Additionally, the seat should appear to be part of a single constructed unit with the rest of the mechanism, with no gaps or misaligned sections that disrupt the illusion of seamless adherence.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the mechanical legs have realistic hinge mechanisms, correct proportions, and no overlapping or misplaced segments that break spatial logic?",
    "explanation": "The mechanical legs in Image B should exhibit a believable mechanical function, similar to robotic or articulated parts found in engineered structures. The hinge mechanisms should appear functional, allowing movement akin to joints in insects. Each segment of the leg should be correctly proportioned and logically placed; there should be no visual confusion, overlap, or inconsistencies that suggest errors in design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the wingtips smoothly attached to the top tube, showing consistent copper coloring, reflective properties, and no jagged edges or texture repetition?",
    "explanation": "The wings in Image B should transition smoothly from their base to tip, and should be attached in a manner that integrates them seamlessly into the overall mechanical composition. The coloring should reflect an even tone of copper, with appropriate highlights and reflections that mimic metallic surfaces. The edges of the wings should be clean and devoid of any artifacts that might disrupt the smoothness of the visual presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the clock faces clearly visible, properly embedded in the handlebars, and free from texture artifacts, incorrect lighting, or distorted numerals/runes?",
    "explanation": "The clock faces in Image B should be identifiable and proportionally fitting within the space reserved for them within the design. They should display time markers (numerals or runes) that are clear and undistorted, maintaining their integrity despite the image's fantastical context. The lighting should enhance the visibility and vibrancy of the numerals, ensuring no blurring or artifacts that diminish clarity.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do all newly added mechanical elements (legs, joints, wings, clocks) share consistent material properties, such as metallic sheen, color tone, and surface imperfections, without abrupt visual breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, all added mechanical features should harmonize visually, possessing a united aesthetic in terms of texture, color, and finish. Metallic sheen must be applied consistently across all elements, with lighting and imperfections contributing to a coherent appearance. Abrupt transitions in color or texture will break the illusion of a single crafted organism, so consistency here is crucial.",
    "answer": "Yes"
