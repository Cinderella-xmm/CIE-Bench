      "question": "Does the Funko Pop-style box maintain a consistent texture and color scheme that aligns naturally with the theme of the gorilla, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop-style box design in Image B features a geometric pattern with leaf motifs that correspond to the jungle theme associated with the gorilla. The color scheme includes green and brown tones that are typical for jungle-themed visual textures, ensuring that it complements the gorilla theme. The box art is neatly presented without visible artifacts, supporting a coherent design. This analysis is based on visual cues relating to color theme and pattern coherence which align with typical design expectations for themed collectible packaging.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the chibi-style gorilla figure inside the box structurally consistent and visually credible, without any distorted or deformed features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla figure is modeled in a stylized 'chibi' form, which inherently includes exaggerated proportions such as larger heads and smaller bodies. Nonetheless, within this stylistic framework, the figure maintains typical chibi proportions that do not appear unnaturally distorted or misshapen. The limbs, facial features, and body structure follow the conventional chibi aesthetic without irregularities, making it visually credible as a Funko Pop toy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the realistic illustration of the gorilla beside the box exhibit detailed textures and lighting that enhance the lifelike appearance, without any loss of fine details or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains no realistic illustration of the gorilla beside the box comparable to Image A. The figure shown in Image B follows a 'chibi' aesthetic rather than a realistic style. Thus, there's no need for realistic detail or texture enhancement as expected in a lifelike illustration, and comparison is moot.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the design of the Funko Pop-style box, including the title \"JUNGLE KING,\" visually credible and free from any obvious unnatural artifacts that could detract from the overall realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop-style box in Image B shows a well-integrated title 'JUNGLE KING' that corresponds to the jungle theme inferred from its gorilla figure. The text is styled to match the collectible branding and doesn't present any artifacts or inconsistencies within expected design principles for such packaging, maintaining visual credibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the accessories (leafy crown, wooden staff, and jungle-themed details) accompanying the chibi-style gorilla figure appear physically rational and undistorted, contributing to the overall visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style gorilla is adorned with accessories like a leafy crown and a wooden staff. These items are well-proportioned and fit the thematic context of a jungle setting, enhancing the figure's costume credibility. The accessories are intentionally exaggerated in proportions as is typical for chibi figures, but they maintain a consistent form without distortion, contributing positively to the visual aesthetic.",
