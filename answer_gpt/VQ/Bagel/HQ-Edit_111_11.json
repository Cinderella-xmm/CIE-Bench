      "question": "Does the fedora hat sit naturally on the man's head without visible misalignment, unnatural shadows, or clipping artifacts at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fedora hat appears to sit naturally on the man's head. The positioning does not exhibit obvious misalignment or clipping artifacts along the edges. The shadowing around the hat is consistent with the overall lighting in the image, giving it a natural appearance. This assessment relies on common knowledge of how hats fit and appear in relation to human heads in photographs.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Do the figures in the background wear clothing consistent with 1920s fashion, with correct proportions, no overlapping or missing limbs, and natural fabric draping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in the background of Image B are depicted wearing clothing styles that align with 1920s fashion, such as tailored suits and cloche hats. The proportions appear correct, with no missing limbs or overlapping that would suggest an error in depiction. The fabric exhibits natural draping, adding to the authenticity of the period-specific style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands holding the saxophone have five fingers each. The positioning is natural, consistent with how one would hold a musical instrument, and the fingers show visible knuckles without any deformation or the presence of extra digits. This assessment is based on typical human anatomy and how fingers align during instrument handling.",
