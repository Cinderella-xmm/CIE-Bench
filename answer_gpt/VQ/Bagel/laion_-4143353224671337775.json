    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the beige and brown puzzle pieces uniformly aligned and interlocked across the surface of the sculpture without visible gaps, misalignments, or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the puzzle pieces are visually inspected for alignment and interlocking. They appear tightly connected without visible gaps or irregular jagged edges, indicating a smooth integration of the pieces. This observation suggests precise craftsmanship where pieces are designed to fit together seamlessly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the edges of the puzzle pieces follow the natural curvature of the original ceramic head shape without abrupt angular deviations or unnatural flattening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the puzzle pieces are observed to form a shape that follows a consistent curvature, similar to a 3D figure. There are no sudden angles or flat sections, indicating that the puzzle pieces maintain the form of a rounded or organic structure, similar to the shape of an animal or character.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the green puzzle fragment on the top of the head smooth and free of rough textures, cracks, or color variations that contrast with the surrounding beige and brown puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green puzzle piece in Image B is analyzed for uniformity against the backdrop of beige and brown pieces. It appears smooth, without rough textures or visible cracks. The color is consistent, not displaying noticeable variations, which causes it to blend harmoniously with the surrounding pieces.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed horizontally on the white shelf with stable contact and no floating or tilting effects, maintaining a natural shadow and perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is positioned on a shelf, showing a stable horizontal placement. The shadow cast beneath matches the expected natural lighting and perspective, with no indication of levitating or odd tilting. This suggests the sculpture is firmly and naturally placed on the surface.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, eyebrows, mouth, ears) clearly preserved in shape and proportion despite being integrated into the puzzle piece design, without deformation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are integrated into the puzzle design while maintaining clarity. The shapes of the eyes, eyebrows, and other features remain proportionate, without blurring or distortion, which demonstrates the design's ability to preserve recognizable elements despite the complexity of the puzzle piece format.",
