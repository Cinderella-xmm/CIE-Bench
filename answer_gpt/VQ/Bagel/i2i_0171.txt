    "Question": "Q1: Do the skis appear naturally detached from the skier with no visible artifacts or unnatural distortions in their shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skis are separate from the skier within the packaging and appear to maintain their shape without any visible distortions. By comparing this to Image A, where the skis are attached to the skier's boots during the action of skiing, the shape and structure of the skis remain consistent with no unnatural artifacts introduced during the editing process. This suggests that the detachment is done cleanly.",

The integration of the snow powder base in the figurine aligns with the cardboard illustration, maintaining structural consistency with the real snow environment depicted in Image A. The absence of unnatural textures or breaks in the scene's consistency reflects a seamless integration.",
