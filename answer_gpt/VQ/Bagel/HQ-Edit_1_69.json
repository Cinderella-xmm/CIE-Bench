      "question": "Does the red dress maintain natural fabric folds and surface texture despite increased saturation and bold outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress is part of an illustration with bold outlines, and its details are simplified, focusing on creating a striking and stylized appearance rather than maintaining the natural fabric folds and texture seen in real life. In such illustrative styles, details like fabric texture are often abstracted. Therefore, the dress does not maintain natural fabric folds or surface texture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the woman’s leg and arm positions consistent with natural human biomechanics during a walking motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a stylized illustration where the woman's leg and arm positions are simplified. The left leg is extended forward in a typical walking posture and the left arm is positioned with a handbag, consistent with depicting a dynamic pose. However, due to the illustrative nature, exact biomechanics may not be perfectly represented but appear generally consistent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black slipcase visually integrated into the scene with consistent lighting and shadow direction relative to the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black slipcase appears as an added frame to the illustration. The flat colors and bold outlines of the illustration style do not interact directly with the realistic lighting and shadows of the first image, so while the slipcase is included in the composition, it's not part of the environment and does not demonstrate interaction through shadows or lighting.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bold outlines around the woman’s body follow the natural contours of her shape without creating gaps or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the bold outlines emphasize the stylized form of the character. They effectively follow the general contours of the woman's body, with the aim of maintaining clarity and coherence in illustration without noticeable gaps or incorrect overlaps.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the woman’s right hand have five fingers with natural proportions and smooth skin texture, without deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the style of illustration simplifies and abstracts details in favor of a bold, graphic representation. The right hand may not retain realistic detailing or exact proportions due to this style, often omitting detailed digits to simplify form in such artwork.",
