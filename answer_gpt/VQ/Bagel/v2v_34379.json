      "question": "Do the shrunk vegetables retain their natural texture and fine details without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrunk vegetables maintain their natural appearance and fine surface details, consistent with how broccoli appears naturally. The florets exhibit the expected texture without noticeable artifacts or unnatural modifications. In comparing with Image A, it's clear the overall texture of the broccoli in both images is detailed and realistic, suggesting a quality edit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the shapes of the shrunk vegetables proportionate and physically plausible, avoiding any unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the shrunk broccoli florets with natural and proportionate shapes. The stems and tops of the florets appear well-formed, resembling realistic broccoli morphology. Upon comparison with Image A, although the florets are smaller, they maintain the coherence of proportions seen in naturally grown broccoli, indicating a lack of distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shrinkage preserve the natural colors and material appearance of the vegetables without introducing any artificial tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli retains a consistent green color that aligns with the typical appearance of fresh broccoli, demonstrating no noticeable changes in hue that could be deemed artificial. When compared to Image A, both the originals and the shrunk vegetables exhibit the typical dark green shade, ensuring color authenticity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the spatial arrangement of the shrunk vegetables consistent with the original structure, maintaining visual credibility within the dish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of broccoli florets in Image B mirrors the layout seen in Image A, despite the reduction in size. The spatial distribution remains logical, with the florets evenly spread across the dish. This logical continuity reinforces visual credibility that the shrinkage was carefully applied while conserving the original positioning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the edges and geometric shapes of the shrunk vegetables remained intact, avoiding any broken or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shrunk broccoli in Image B exhibits well-defined edges and geometric shapes characteristic of naturally cut broccoli. Detailed observations show intact and smoothly contoured circumferences. Comparatively, Image A also showcases similar integrity in edge presentation, supporting the view that Image B did not introduce irregularities.",
