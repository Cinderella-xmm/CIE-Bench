      "question": "Do the transformed plants maintain recognizable plant-like structures without unnatural appendages or disproportionate body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plants are transformed into fantastical creatures rather than maintaining the appearance of conventional plants. These creatures have distinctive features like eyes, wings, and facial expressions, which do not align with typical plant-like structures. Therefore, the elements in the image are not conventional plant forms and exhibit appendages that are not characteristic of recognizable plant structures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vine patterns on the leaves seamlessly blended with the leaf texture, showing no visible edges, clipping, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vine patterns depicted appear to be part of a fantastical scene with exaggerated and animated characteristics. Without inconsistencies in the blending or edges visible, the patterns show a seamless integration with the surrounding textures, suggesting an intentional design typical of illustrated or animated scenes where shading and texturing are typically cohesive.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the magical orbs replace the original flowers in the same positions and emit light that interacts realistically with nearby surfaces and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orbs in Image B appear to be independent of any original positioning related to flowers and exhibit a bright, glowing effect. However, the light effect doesn't provide realistic interaction with shadows or surfaces, as the entire scene is depicted in a stylized, cartoonish manner that does not focus on realistic lighting dynamics that we associate with physical interaction.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shelves positioned above the ground with soft shadows beneath them that align with the light source and do not show unnatural gaps or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no shelves similar to those in a natural or realistic environment. The focus is on a fantasy landscape, where concepts like 'shelves' are nonexistent, and the elements float or are positioned in a surreal manner. Thus, shadows do not align in any conventional sense due to the absence of standard light physics in this depicted context.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the iridescent foliage cascade from the ceiling in a way that follows the structural lines of the roof frame and allows light to diffuse naturally through its layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is a fantastical, imagined forest environment with no direct representation of a ceiling structure. Iridescent foliage is depicted, but not in relation to a roof. The image suggests a magical environment where spatial dynamics don't apply the same way as a natural or constructed roof. Thus, thereâ€™s no reference to structural lines or natural light diffusion in the way a physical structure would direct.",
