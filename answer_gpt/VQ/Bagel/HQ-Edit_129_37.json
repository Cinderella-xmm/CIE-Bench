      "question": "Does the glass container maintain the original circular shape and proportions of the compass body, with no warped edges or irregular thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the glass container is observed to have a consistent circular shape and proportions similar to the compass body visible in Image A. There are no signs of warped edges or irregular thickness. This analysis draws upon the common design characteristic of rounded, smooth surfaces for glass containers, which typically aim for symmetry and uniform thickness for both aesthetic and functional reasons.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the spray nozzle centered within the glass container, aligned with the pivot point of the original needle, and does it have a smooth, continuous metallic surface without jagged edges or textural inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spray nozzle appears to be centrally located within the glass container, aligning with the central pivot point that would be associated with a compass needle. The metallic surface appears smooth and without jagged edges or textural inconsistencies, which reflects a common design characteristic of finely crafted perfume bottles where the nozzle is manufactured to be aesthetically pleasing and functional.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cap feature a detailed engraving of a vintage map that is evenly distributed across its surface, with no blurred lines or inconsistent depth, and is it attached seamlessly to the top of the glass container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although there is an indication of a vintage design, the cap lacks detailed engraving of a vintage map. It also does not appear to have detailed engravings evenly distributed across its surface. It seems primarily metallic and seamlessly attached to the container but without the specified map engraving.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bronze gradient applied smoothly across the glass container and cap, with subtle variations in tone that simulate wear and light reflection, and no sharp color boundaries or artificial sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bronze gradient appears to be applied smoothly across the container and cap. The gradient shows subtle variations in tone simulating light reflection and wear, without sharp color boundaries or artificial sheen. Such a smooth gradient is typically seen in high-quality edited images aiming for realistic material representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the branding text visible along the outer rim of the glass container, with consistent font size and spacing, and does it appear embedded into the surface without overlapping or floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes branding text along the outer rim of the glass container. A closer look reveals consistent font size and spacing. The text appears embedded into the surface, which suggests a typical design choice for premium products, ensuring the text is seamlessly part of the container's structure and not awkwardly floating or overlapping.",
