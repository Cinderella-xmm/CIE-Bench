      "question": "Are the cat's limbs and body proportions appropriate for its new lounging pose on the sofa without appearing unnaturally distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is positioned on a sofa with a relaxed pose. The limbs, including the visible paw, appear proportional to the cat’s body, which aligns with common feline lounging positions. As cats typically have flexible bodies allowing them to comfortably drape or sit, this arrangement does not seem unnatural. The body proportions observe common feline physicality.",

      "question": "Do the glasses on the cat's face fit naturally and are they free from any visible artifacts such as unnatural texture or alignment issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the cat wearing glasses, a humorous edit. The glasses are aligned with the cat's eyes without visible misalignment or awkward texture blending. Considering the edit that places the glasses accurately on the bridge of the cat's nose without crooked positioning or pixelation artifacts, they visually integrate with the cat's face.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the cat and the living room background smooth, with no distracting edges or mismatches in lighting and shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the integration of the cat with the living room is mostly smooth. The lighting inside the room and the shadows on the cat are consistent. There are no sharp edges or jarring contrasts between the cat’s features and the background, suggesting a thorough edit. The lighting matches indoor environments, ensuring a realistic scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the remote control look naturally placed, with fingers appropriately positioned around the remote, avoiding any anatomical distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paw, resembling a hand, grips a remote control in a plausible manner. The paw's positioning around the remote reflects standard gripping gestures, where fingers wrap around the object. The design avoids any anatomical distortion, akin to how one might see a paw grasp a cylindrical item if such positioning were possible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors and materials used for the cat, the sofa, and the living room consistent and harmonious, contributing to an overall authentic and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette harmonizes between the cat, sofa, and living room. The cat's fur blends with the sofa's texture both in color and material depiction, and the room possesses matching hues and lighting that support a coherent visual experience. This consistency forms a natural appearance and enhances the edited image's authenticity.",
