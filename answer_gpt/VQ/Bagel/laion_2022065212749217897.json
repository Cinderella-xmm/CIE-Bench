    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head disproportionately large compared to the body but without stretched or compressed facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head is depicted as significantly larger compared to the body, a common characteristic of chibi or caricature styles where proportions differ from real-life figures. The general shape of the head is round and smooth without any signs of stretching or compression. This style often emphasizes a large head to convey certain aesthetic qualities.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) clearly visible and proportionally accurate despite the enlarged head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B are not visible as they are blurred. Therefore, there is no information to assess the proportion or visibility of facial features.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the stripes on the shirt maintain consistent width, alignment, and color accuracy across the collar and chest area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt has yellow and blue stripes, and their width and alignment remain consistent across the collar and chest area of the figure. This indicates that there was attention to maintaining uniformity and accuracy in the design of the stripes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the surface of the figure appear smooth and reflective, with no visible texture artifacts or rough edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the figure in Image B looks smooth and slightly reflective, which is typical for a plastic or resin figure. There are no visible texture artifacts or rough edges present, providing a clean finish to the object.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform pastel color with no gradients, shadows, or blending artifacts near the figure's edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a uniform pastel pink color with no noticeable gradients, shadows, or artifacts around the edges of the figure. This creates a clear visual separation between the figure and the background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the facial expression more animated than the original (e.g., wider eyes, open mouth) but still anatomically consistent and not distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As the facial features in Image B are blurred, itâ€™s impossible to determine if the facial expression is more animated or if it maintains anatomical consistency compared to the original.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
