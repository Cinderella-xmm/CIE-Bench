    "Question": "Q1: Do the chibi car mascots retain their original car shapes and colors without any noticeable distortion or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "The chibi car mascots in Image B retain the shapes and colors we associate with cars, albeit in a stylized, toy-like form. The blue and red cars are clearly distinguishable, and they maintain key characteristics such as wheels, headlights, and overall shape to represent cars, despite their exaggerated, cartoon-like appearance. Thus, there is neither noticeable distortion nor loss of detail that would make them unrecognizable as cars.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the textures and fine details of the cars accurately represented in the chibi car mascots without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The chibi car mascots are designed to be cartoonish and do not aim to replicate realistic car textures or details. Instead, they present a smooth, simplistic surface typical of cartoon or toy designs. Artifacts typically refer to unintended visual errors, which are not present here as the image execution is consistent with its intended style. Therefore, although the detail level is minimal due to the toy-like representation, this is in line with the stylistic choice rather than being an artifact.",
