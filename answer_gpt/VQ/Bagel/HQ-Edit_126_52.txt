    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal shards aligned with the cactus ribs and uniformly distributed without gaps or overlapping clusters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal shards appear evenly spaced along the ribs of the cactus. The distribution is uniform without visible gaps or overlapping clusters, which suggests meticulous design alignment with the underlying structure. The reasoning is based on the observation of consistent positioning relative to the cactus ribs and the absence of visual clutter.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the luminous glyphs follow the rib lines of the cactus and emit a soft glow without causing overexposure or halo effects?",
    "explanation": "The glyphs in Image B are positioned along the ribs of the cactus, indicating intentional placement that respects the natural segmentation of the plant. They emit light softly, with no signs of overexposure or halo effects visible in the image, as evidenced by the clear visibility of each glyph's form and the absence of bright spots or surrounding halos.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the sandstone pedestal fully grounded on the wooden surface with natural texture and no floating or clipped edges?",
    "explanation": "The pedestal in Image B appears naturally placed on the wooden surface, with its base evenly resting on the wood. The texture and edges are consistent with a grounded appearance, showing no signs of floating or clipping. This assessment is based on the visible contact between the pedestal and surface without any unnatural separation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the amber eyes embedded within the cactus ribs at symmetrical positions and do they show internal illumination without distorting the surrounding tissue?",
    "explanation": "The amber eyes in Image B are symmetrically embedded within the cactus ribs, maintaining balance in position relative to each other. They display internal illumination, evidenced by their vibrant glow, yet the surrounding cactus tissue remains intact without distortion or deformation from the light source. This conclusion leverages both visual symmetry and the structural integrity of the cactus.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the vine tendrils curve naturally around the pedestal and connect smoothly to the base without floating or rigid positioning?",
    "explanation": "The vine tendrils in Image B are depicted with natural curves wrapping around the pedestal, integrating smoothly into the base structure. They demonstrate fluidity in their arrangement, avoiding any rigid or floating appearance, which is evident in the curved lines and consistent contact with the pedestal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
