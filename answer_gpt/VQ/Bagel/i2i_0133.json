      "question": "Does the scarf placed around the bear's neck appear naturally attached without introducing unnatural folds or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scarf around the bear's neck in Image B appears smooth and fits neatly without visible gaps or folds. The positioning of the scarf aligns well with the bear's neck, and it doesn't appear forced or awkward, which suggests a natural attachment. This is assessed through the seamless curve and fit around the neck area, typical of objects that's been carefully placed on plush toys.",

      "question": "Do the scarf's texture and the bear's fur texture integrate seamlessly, avoiding any noticeable artifacts or contrasting material differences?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarf shows a woolen texture with a soft, plush look that corresponds well to the bear’s fur texture. The materials appear visually compatible, as both have an inviting softness and fitting appearance. There are no distinct or jarring artifacts suggesting different materials that clash - both appear cozy and unified.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the scarf proportionate to the bear's size, neither appearing overly large nor too small to maintain a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Relative to the bear's size, the scarf in Image B appropriately encircles the neck area, staying wide enough for a noticeable presence but not overwhelming the bear's plush body. This proportionality can be deduced from visual balance - where the scarf neither diminishes the visibility of the bear nor dominates its features.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the scarf enhance the bear's cuteness factor appropriate for a Children’s Day gift while keeping its design simple and uncluttered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scarf in Image B is a simple and charming accessory that adds to the bear's cuteness factor with its pastel color and soft appearance. It maintains simplicity, avoiding excessive patterns or decorations that might detract from the bear's plush appeal, contributing to its suitability for a child-themed gift.",

      "question": "Are the bear's facial features and paw details preserved intact after adding the scarf, without any degradation or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial and paw details of the bear in Image B remain well-preserved, maintaining clear lines and smooth surfaces that reflect quality plush craftsmanship. Adding the scarf appears not to have altered or obscured these features, which are visually distinct and free from distracting artifacts, indicating that the editing was done carefully.",
