      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the transformed skis and hockey sticks maintain their original structural integrity and proportions as footwear, avoiding any unnatural distortions or breaks in geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skis appear more elongated and cylindrical compared to typical footwear, with no visible indications of foot openings or sole structures. The hockey sticks retain their original form without any apparent modifications to resemble footwear. Analyzing structural continuity and shape integrity, the objects in Image B do not exhibit characteristics typical of transferred footwear design, maintaining their original elongated forms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vivid patterns and wooden textures from the original skis and hockey sticks naturally incorporated into the footwear design without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skis in Image B possess a distinctly new color scheme with bold black, red, and cream patterns, diverging significantly from the vibrant multicolor designs in Image A. The hockey sticks remain unchanged with the same wooden texture. While the skis' transformation doesn't preserve the original patterns, there is no introduction of unnatural textures; however, it reflects a significant loss of the original detail design.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transition from skis and hockey sticks to footwear appear logical and plausible, maintaining the visual credibility of both the original and new forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases skis in a tubular form without clear footwear identifiers such as soles, heels, or openings conducive to wearing. The hockey sticks maintain their original structure. This implies a lack of logical transition maintaining the visual functionality and plausibility necessary for footwear design.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the original skis and hockey sticks been preserved in the new footwear design, avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents skis entirely covered in new patterns, missing the intricate multicolor details of Image A. The wooden texture of the hockey sticks is unchanged. This indicates a loss of fine detail from the original design on the skis, although there are no unnatural textures introduced.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the new footwear design respect the physical properties and proportions of the original skis and hockey sticks, avoiding any distortion or damage to geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skis and hockey sticks in Image B retain their elongated shapes without geometric distortion. However, their conversion into plausible footwear is not apparent, thus the physical properties and proportions necessary for functional footwear are absent, reflecting that the structure doesn't support the intended transition.",
