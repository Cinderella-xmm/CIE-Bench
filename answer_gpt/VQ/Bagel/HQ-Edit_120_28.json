      "question": "Is the treasure chest still geometrically intact and proportionally consistent with its original form when placed on the newly added weathered map background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the treasure chest is depicted on a map style illustration. Geometrically, it appears to retain its shape and proportions as compared to a realistic rendering. Despite the shift from a 3D realistic rendering in Image A to a 2D illustration style in Image B, the chest's structure, including the arching lid and rivet details, remains consistent. The proportions of the chest seem intact and logically placed within the map's illustrative context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ropes used as decorative borders maintain their natural fiber texture and realistic coil shapes without appearing stretched, flattened, or unnaturally contorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ropes are used as part of an illustrated map border. The challenge is translating the realistic rope texture from Image A into a 2D drawing while maintaining coherence. The ropes in the map appear consistent with a drawn style, maintaining their coil shape and texture as a line drawing, effectively replicating the appearance without unnatural distortion despite their illustrated nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the symbols and ancient-style text in the legend aligned properly with the overall lighting and depth of the image, and do they appear cleanly rendered without jagged edges or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The symbols and text on the map in Image B are designed in an ancient style, consistent with the thematic elements of a treasure map. They are cleanly rendered in black ink, contrasting clearly against the parchment-like background without evident jagged edges or color bleeding. The style maintains a consistent flat appearance, suitable for a drawing and properly aligned with the illustrative style of the map.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the compass rose in the bottom-right corner have consistent metallic sheen and shadowing that aligns with the lighting direction and material properties of the surrounding gold coins and gems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The compass rose in Image B is part of the map's drawn features and does not have a realistic metallic sheen. Instead, it fits into the drawn ink style seen across the map. Unlike Image A, which uses shadowing subtly on realistic elements, the compass doesn't carry a sheen but matches the aesthetic with consistent style and coherent line shading appropriate for an illustration.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sea monster motifs seamlessly blended into the map background, maintaining consistent line thickness and shading with the rest of the ink drawings, and do they not appear as disjointed or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sea monsters are illustrated within the same ink drawing style used for the rest of the map's elements. This integration allows for consistent line thickness and shading, resulting in a cohesive appearance that aligns with the map's overall aesthetic. They are well-blended into the background without appearing disjointed or out of place.",
