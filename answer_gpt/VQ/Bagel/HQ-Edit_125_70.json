      "question": "Is the logo on the hammer handle seamlessly integrated with no visible texture mismatch, jagged edges, or unnatural color contrast compared to the surrounding wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo on the hammer handle should appear as if it has been naturally printed or engraved onto the wood. A seamless integration would mean that there are no signs of the logo being digitally altered, such as texture mismatches or visible edges where the logo meets the wood. The color should also blend naturally with the handle's wood, without looking excessively bright or dull compared to the rest of the handle. Upon examining the image, the logo seems well integrated with the wood, with no noticeable inconsistencies or misalignments.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the letters on the wood shavings follow the natural curvature and thickness of each shaving without appearing flattened, stretched, or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For the letters on the wood shavings to appear natural, they must adhere to the curvature and shape of the shavings, giving the impression of being printed on the surface. If the letters look flat or appear to float above the shavings, they would seem artificially imposed. In Image B, however, upon close inspection, the letters do not seem to follow the natural lines of the shavings entirely and may show signs of being superimposed rather than naturally part of the shavings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the rustic banner at the top align with the lighting and shadows of the scene, and does its texture appear consistent with natural aged wood or fabric rather than digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rustic banner should blend into the overall image by aligning with the scene’s lighting and shadows, as well as having a texture that mimics natural aged wood or fabric. This would entail having consistent shadows and highlights that match the rest of the image’s lighting conditions. Upon analysis of Image B, the banner seems to align well with the scene’s lighting, displaying a realistic texture that merges with the ambient setup.",

      "question": "Are the copper accents on the pegboard evenly lit and shaded, matching the surrounding grayscale tones without creating unrealistic reflections or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The copper accents should be consistently integrated into the pegboard scene. This means having even shading and lighting that aligns with the monochrome or subtle tones of the image, without looking out of place or causing abrupt changes in color or lighting when viewed in context. Upon inspecting Image B, the accents are consistently lit alongside the surrounding elements, without noticeable jarring contrasts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the business card positioned with correct perspective and scale relative to the tools and workbench, and does it cast a subtle shadow consistent with the ambient light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A correctly positioned business card should exhibit perspective scaling, making it appear consistent with the spatial arrangement of the surrounding tools and workbench. Additionally, it should have shadows that reflect the lighting environment of the image. The business card in Image B is appropriately sized and aligned with the scene. The shadows cast are subtle yet consistent with the overall lighting, indicating accurate placement and lighting integration in the depicted setting.",
