      "question": "Does the fireplace appear naturally integrated into the medieval castle hall setting without any visible unnatural textures or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fireplace is styled with medieval elements, such as stone carvings and a turret-like structure at the top, which are typical of castle architecture. There are no visible broken geometric shapes or textures that seem inconsistent, giving an impression of natural integration into the setting.",

      "question": "Do the stone carvings that replace the bookshelves exhibit realistic stone textures and colors, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area surrounding the fireplace has been transformed into stone carvings, replacing bookshelves.

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sofas and table adequately adapted or replaced to fit the medieval hall setting, maintaining structural coherence and visual credibility in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofas and table retain their modern design rather than being adapted or replaced with furniture appropriate for a medieval hall. The styling of the sofas is contemporary, and they do not visually align with the traditional medieval elements in the rest of the room, which affects the overall coherence.",

      "question": "Is the lighting consistent with a medieval castle hall setting, with no unnatural shadows or light effects disrupting the scene's authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B creates a warm ambiance that is consistent with a medieval setting, likely coming from torches or sconces typical of such environments. The shadows and light effects seem natural, contributing to the atmospheric quality of a medieval hall.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rug seems unchanged in pattern and appears like a contemporary design, which may not be historically accurate for a medieval castle hall. The intricate patterns of the rug could be considered out of place against the medieval elements, affecting seamless integration.",
