    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the girl, stone platform, and frisbee free of unnatural distortions or artifacts, appearing structurally coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl, stone platform, and frisbee appear proportionate and logically positioned. There are no visible distortions or artifacts that disrupt the perception of these elements as realistic. The girl is standing on the stone platform, holding the frisbee in a manner consistent with a natural posture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the grass and blue sky background integrate smoothly with the foreground elements, avoiding obvious seams or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear distinction between the grass, stone platform, and the blue sky background. The integration appears smooth with no visible seams or obvious texture mismatches that would detract from the coherence of the overall image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the girl, stone platform, and frisbee adhere to the golden ratio principles in their positioning, creating a balanced and visually credible composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the girl, stone platform, and frisbee in Image B does not explicitly illustrate adherence to the golden ratio, which is a specific mathematical structure in compositions. However, they are arranged in a manner that appears visually balanced and credible without any awkward spacing or alignment issues.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details like the texture of the girl's clothing, the surface of the stone platform, and the frisbee preserved clearly without degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the details such as the texture of the girl's clothing and the surface of the stone platform are reasonably clear. The frisbee is depicted with clarity as well. There is no indication of detail degradation; the textures appear visually consistent and well-rendered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting on the girl, stone platform, and frisbee match the lighting conditions of the new grass and sky background, avoiding mismatched shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the girl, stone platform, and frisbee generally matches the surrounding environment of grass and sky. The light seems to be consistent, with no noticeable mismatched shadows or highlights suggesting an incongruent lighting condition.",
