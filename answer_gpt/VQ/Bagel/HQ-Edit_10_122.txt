    "Question": "Q1: Does the patterned textile on the character’s top display coherent geometric shapes, consistent color gradients, and natural fabric-like texture without visible distortions or repeating digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The patterned textile in Image B is detailed with a vibrant mix of colors and geometric motifs, such as circles and linear forms. The texture appears consistent with a realistic fabric-like surface, reflecting light naturally. There is no evidence of digital artifacts such as pixelation or repetitive patterns that would disrupt the harmony of design elements in a typical textile.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the tribal motifs on the gold earrings and necklaces clearly defined, proportionally accurate, and free from distorted edges or unrealistic surface reflections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tribal motifs on the gold jewelry are intricately designed, with clear and precise lines that make them stand out against the skin. The proportions seem appropriate, aligning with the customary size of such accessories. The reflections on the metal appear realistic, capturing light naturally without displaying any distortion or over-the-top shine that doesn't align with a metallic surface.",

    "Question": "Q3: Do the abstracted umbrellas in the background maintain plausible proportions and spatial relationships, without overlapping or floating inconsistently relative to the market stalls?",
    "explanation": "The umbrellas in Image B are positioned with attention to realism in terms of their spatial presence in a market setting, aligning with the stalls' structure. Their proportions are consistent, avoiding any overlapping or floating effects that would appear unnatural. This uses common perspective techniques to ensure that objects align with the ground and the scene's depth.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the musical notes distributed evenly and positioned along plausible trajectories around the character’s head, without sharp breaks or abrupt cutoffs in their paths?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the musical notes are arranged in a dynamic yet balanced manner around the character's head, creating a sense of rhythm and flow expected from musical elements. The notes don't abruptly end or break off unnaturally; instead, they follow a curved trajectory, enhancing the fluidity and artistic motion within the image.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the character’s right hand show five fingers with correct proportions, natural curvature, and realistic skin texture, without any missing, duplicated, or misshapen digits?",
    "explanation": "The character's right hand in Image B features all five fingers, each with accurate proportions consistent with a natural human hand. The curvature of the fingers is realistic, and the skin texture is finely detailed, with no signs of missing or duplicated digits, nor any distortion that would make them appear unnatural or misshapen.",
    "answer": "Yes"
