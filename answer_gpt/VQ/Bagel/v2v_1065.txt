    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi-style 3D figure maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the skateboarder's mid-action pose without distortion?",
    "explanation": "The chibi-style 3D figure is a stylized representation, which often features exaggerated proportions for aesthetic purposes. In Image B, the figure maintains a stylized pose of the skateboarder that corresponds with the mid-action dynamic seen in skateboarding. Despite the intentional artistic distortion for a chibi design, the pose itself reflects the action faithfully, maintaining the essence of the movement without disrupting the physical rationality of a skateboarding pose. Therefore, the proportions and dynamics of the pose are appropriate for the chibi style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the tiny palm trees and ramps inside the snow globe naturally integrated into the scene without introducing unnatural textures or broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tiny palm trees and ramps are miniaturized versions meant to fit the aesthetic of a snow globe. The textures of the palm trees and ramps appear smooth and consistent with their miniature scale, avoiding any broken or unnatural geometric shapes. These elements are designed to complement the whimsical and creative theme of the snow globe environment, making them appear naturally integrated within the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the character's clothing and skateboard retain their fine details and natural textures inside the snow globe?",
    "explanation": "The chibi figureâ€™s clothing and skateboard are depicted with clear and consistent textures, appropriate to its miniature and stylized design. Image B presents these elements without losing significant details; for instance, the texture and color of the clothing and skateboard are visibly coherent and are scaled properly for the chibi aesthetic, preserving the integrity of the design elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the snow globe resting on the table near the window appear structurally consistent and visually credible with realistic light scattering effects?",
    "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B shows a well-rendered glass sphere that reflects and scatters light in a manner that is plausible with real-world optics. Light is appropriately diffused, creating a structurally consistent and visually credible image, indicative of realistic light scattering effects that enhance the perception of depth and material quality.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the snow falling inside the snow globe look natural and enhance the lively atmosphere without appearing artificial or out of place?",
    "explanation": "The depiction of snow falling inside the snow globe in Image B contributes to an animated and lively scene. The snow flakes are rendered with attention to how they distribute in space, appearing natural and consistent with the expected behavior of particles in a snow globe. This enhances the charm of the scene without seeming artificial or disconnected from the cohesive design aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
