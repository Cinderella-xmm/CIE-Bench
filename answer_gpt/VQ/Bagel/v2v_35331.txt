    "Question": "Q4: Do the proportions of the dog and the banana remain realistic and proportional to each other, avoiding any unnatural stretching or shrinking?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions between the dog and the banana are exaggerated, as bananas are typically much smaller compared to dogs. However, the edited image seems to have aimed for a playful, exaggerated portrayal rather than a realistic comparison. Nevertheless, upon technical terms, this is not proportional if we go strictly by natural size comparisons.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the materials of the dog's fur and the banana's peel retain their natural texture and appearance, contributing to the overall realism?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's fur seems detailed and natural, familiar to real dog appearances. The banana’s peel also retains its natural glossiness and speckled texture. Both maintain a realistic texture which contributes effectively to the visual realism despite the exaggerated size portrayal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
