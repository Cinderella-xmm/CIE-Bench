    "Question": "Q1: Are the limbs of the astronaut proportionally consistent with human anatomy, and do they avoid unnatural bends or distortions in the joints when enlarged with zig-zag motion lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the illustrated astronaut are depicted with cartoonish proportions typical of chibi-style art. This style often exaggerates certain features for effect. Despite this, the limbs still have a clear structure without bends or distortions that would be unnatural for a human. The motion is a stylized representation rather than a realistic one; however, there are no visible zig-zag motion lines distorting anatomical features.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the celestial motifs applied to the suit exhibit uniform texture and shading that aligns with the material appearance of the spacesuit, without visible seams or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the celestial motifs are abstract, depicted as blue spots on the suit. Due to the style of this illustration being more cartoon-like, the texture does not need precision in realism. The motifs are consistent with the suit's visual style, which is flat and unified without any visible seams or texture artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the illustrated moon surface positioned at the correct depth and scale relative to the astronaut’s feet and shadow, with no visible gaps or misalignment between the figure and ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the moon surface is drawn in a cartoonish style. The astronaut stands firmly on this surface, and the cartoon aesthetic aligns the figure well with the ground. There is no misalignment or visible gaps; the shadow adds depth perception consistent with the illustration's style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the astronaut’s face retain natural facial proportions and feature alignment, such as symmetrical eyes and a defined jawline, without excessive smoothing or distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration portrays chibi-style facial proportions with traits like symmetrical eyes and simplified facial features for effect. Although these proportions are exaggerated, they adhere to the style without excessive distortion or errors in feature alignment, maintaining consistency with typical cartoon proportions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the space-themed border evenly aligned around the image edge without overlapping or cutting into the astronaut or background elements, and does the simulated card stock texture appear uniform and free of repetition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the space-themed border is consistently aligned along the edges without overlapping or cutting into the astronaut or other elements. The border design complements the illustration without disrupting the visual composition. The card stock texture effect appears uniform and serves its role without visible repetition errors.",
    "answer": "Yes"
