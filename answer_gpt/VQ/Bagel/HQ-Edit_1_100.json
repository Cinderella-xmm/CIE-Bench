      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the character’s face retain natural proportions and smooth contours despite the half-cartoon style transformation, without visible distortion in facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the half-cartoon style transformation seen in Image B, the character's general proportions and contours should remain coherent and undistorted according to the style's typical approach. In such transformations, natural proportions are often stylized but maintain a coherent shape. Though the face is blurred and cannot be evaluated directly, the overall head shape and body proportions typically align with the style’s conventions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the elongated book's shape geometrically consistent with a real book, maintaining uniform page thickness and aligned edges without warping or stretching artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book appears to resemble an illustrated style while maintaining its overall geometric consistency. The pages are aligned and the thickness looks uniform, suggesting an accurate representation devoid of warping or stretching, which is typical in illustration-style transformations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the sleeves exhibit natural fabric draping with consistent lighting, shadow depth, and fold patterns that align with gravity and textile behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sleeves are depicted in a cartoon style where natural fabric behavior is exaggerated yet consistent with gravity and textile behavior typical for such illustrations. The shadowing and folds are represented in a simplified manner consistent with the style, appearing natural for this type of transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the golden filigree details on the buttons clearly rendered and integrated into the button surface without visible artifacts, such as jagged edges or mismatched reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buttons are illustrated in a simple, clean cartoon style, which effectively minimizes artifacts such as jagged edges or mismatched reflections. The buttons appear to be integrated into the shirt surface without visible rendering issues.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the library shelves transformed into a wooden frame background with consistent wood grain, edge alignment, and depth cues that maintain spatial logic and avoid broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation of the library shelves into a wooden frame background seems to maintain consistent edge alignment and spatial logic typical of a cartoon style. The wood grain appears to be simplified but does not break any perceptual geometry, providing depth and maintaining a clean, consistent representation.",
