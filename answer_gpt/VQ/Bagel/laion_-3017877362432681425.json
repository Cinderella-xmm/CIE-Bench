      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the gullwing doors reshaped into raised, rounded button-like structures symmetrically placed on both sides of the car, with smooth transitions from the body and no visible warping or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gullwing doors appear to have been reshaped into prominent, exaggerated structures resembling buttons. These structures are symmetrically placed on both sides of the car and blend smoothly with the car's body, showing no signs of warping or clipping. This is achieved by observing the visual continuity and the form of the shapes, knowing that symmetrical modifications should maintain visual harmony without visible distortions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the front grille redesigned into a four-segment cross-shaped directional pad with evenly spaced and aligned sections, centered beneath the Mercedes emblem, and free from overlapping or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grille does not resemble a four-segment cross-shaped directional pad. Instead, it appears as part of the car’s revised facial structure, but lacking the clear, distinct shape and alignment that a directional pad implies. Therefore, world knowledge about vehicle design suggests that the grille was not edited into the described pattern.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the entire exterior surface exhibit consistent metallic red coloring with smooth gloss highlights that follow the curvature of the body and reflect ambient light realistically without abrupt transitions or flat areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car displays a consistent metallic red finish with smooth gloss highlights that accurately trace the car's curves, providing a realistic reflection of light. This observation is based on the interplay of light and shadow that aligns with known properties of well-polished metallic surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a detailed emblem located on the dashboard area, resembling a central control button, with clear lines and shading that match the surrounding interior materials and do not appear displaced or blurry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon close inspection, there is no visible emblem on the dashboard that resembles a central control button with defined lines and coherent shading. World knowledge regarding typical dashboard layouts and close analysis suggests such an emblem doesn’t appear prominently or with clarity.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a branded logo placed centrally on the hood, shaped like a circular control element with defined edges and consistent depth, and aligned with the car’s longitudinal axis without tilting or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a branded logo on the hood shaped like a circular element. It has defined edges and seems aligned along the car’s axis without evident tilting or distortion. This is determined by examining the symmetrical position and the lack of visual cues indicating misalignment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all edited components (shoulder buttons, D-pad grille, hood logo) fully attached to the car body with no floating parts, misaligned joints, or unnatural bends in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, all edited components including the exaggerated door structures, revised grille, and hood logo appear seamlessly integrated with the car body. There are no indications of floating parts or misalignment, as reflected by the seamless transitions and absence of unnatural bends in the structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, repeated patterns, or unnatural reflections at the boundaries of edited regions (e.g., door edges, grille perimeter, hood logo)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display visible artifacts like jagged lines or repeated patterns around the edited regions. The transitions appear smooth and natural, achieved by aligning the visual appearance with known high-standard automotive rendering practices, suggesting that any editorial imbalances would be minimal or absent.",
