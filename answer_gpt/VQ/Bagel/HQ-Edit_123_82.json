      "question": "Are the butterfly wings proportionally sized relative to the woman’s body and positioned naturally behind her shoulders without overlapping or distorting her silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings are appropriately sized relative to the woman's body, depicting a harmonious scale where they appear as an aesthetic enhancement rather than overwhelming or awkwardly positioned. The silhouette is preserved, with the wings emerging naturally behind her shoulders. This alignment avoids any distortion of her silhouette, which indicates careful integration and good proportion sense common to art and design principles.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the butterfly wings display consistent and detailed textures across their surfaces, with no visible artifacts such as jagged edges, repeated patterns, or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly wings in Image B show smooth texture transitions, exhibiting uniform patterns and shading that align with natural butterfly wing appearances. There are no visible artifacts like jagged edges or repetitive patterns, often indicative of photo editing, which means the art style is well-maintained. This consistency aligns with graphic design standards for high-quality illustrations where detail and smoothness are pivotal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the woman’s body maintain natural proportions, with no exaggerated limbs, distorted joints, or disproportionate head size that would compromise visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of the woman's body in Image B shows natural proportions typical of stylized illustrations. Her limbs and joints are not exaggerated, maintaining dimensions that provide visual credibility. Her head size, in proportion to her body, remains balanced, avoiding disproportionate representation, aligning with artistic norms where even styled art upholds body balance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the gold embroidery on the red dress clearly defined, textured appropriately, and integrated into the fabric without appearing flat, misplaced, or disconnected from the material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold embroidery on the dress is well-defined and appropriately textured, ensuring it stands out yet remains part of the fabric's design. The embroidery is integrated seamlessly, exhibiting no signs of being flat or misaligned with the dress material. This attention to detail is crucial in art where texture and design coherence enhance the clothing's realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the months displayed on the wings clearly legible, properly aligned, and integrated into the wing design without disrupting the wing’s shape or causing visual conflicts such as overlapping or floating text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, in fact, does not display any months on the butterfly wings, indicating a misunderstanding in the question context or visual interpretation. Consequently, issues like text alignment, visual conflicts, or disruptions do not arise as there's no text to interact with the wing's design.",
