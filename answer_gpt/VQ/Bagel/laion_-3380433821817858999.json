    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the added kneeling figure have five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no distorted joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual cues in Image B, the kneeling figure is illustrated with five fingers on each hand. The hands are shaped naturally without distorted or awkwardly positioned joints, reflecting a standard cartoon representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the legs and torso of the leaping figure properly extended and aligned to reflect forward momentum without broken or warped limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaping figureâ€™s legs and torso are extended and appear naturally aligned to reflect forward momentum typical in jumping action poses. The limbs are not broken or warped and appear to maintain consistent cartoon proportions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the knees tucked tightly toward the chest with natural curvature and no visible deformation in the leg muscles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knee placement is observed where the knees are tucked toward the chest. The curvature aligns with the dynamic action pose and the visual representation in Image B does not show deformation in the leg muscles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bold outlines follow the contours of the figure smoothly without jagged edges or color spillage into adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bold outlines in Image B smoothly follow the contours of the figure without jagged edges or color spillage. The outlines are consistent with typical cartoon styling, adding definition and separating areas cleanly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the text captions and step numbers positioned so they do not cover key facial features or limbs of the main figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text captions and step numbers are strategically positioned to avoid covering the key facial features or limbs of the depicted figures. The layout maintains visibility of both the figure and textual elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the simplified figures in each step scaled consistently with the original character and aligned in perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The simplified figures in Image B are scaled consistently with the original character proportions and aligned in perspective. They maintain distinctive character traits and coherent scaling that matches the overall style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
