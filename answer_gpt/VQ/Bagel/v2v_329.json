      "question": "Are the shapes and proportions of the 3D chibi-style bicycles consistent with their original forms, avoiding any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi-style bicycles have distinctly different proportions compared to realistic bicycles. The shapes are stylized, with thicker handlebars and simplified frames, which is characteristic of chibi-style design, focusing more on cute and rounded shapes rather than realistic proportions. In Image A, the bicycles have realistic proportions, typical of actual bicycles, with thinner frames and detailed components. This difference is due to the artistic choice to present them in a chibi-style which inherently involves distortion for stylistic effect.",

      "question": "Do the colors of the 3D chibi-style bicycles match their original counterparts without introducing any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the 3D chibi-style bicycles have been altered significantly. The tan bicycle has been changed to white and light blue, while other colors have been brightened compared to Image A. Additionally, the color application in Image B is smooth and lacks the natural texture seen in Image A, which includes gradients and shading typical of real objects. This difference is due to the stylized nature of the chibi design, which aims for simplicity rather than realism.",

      "question": "Are the 3D chibi-style bicycles arranged in the same relative positions and spacing as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles appear to be arranged in a similar sequence; however, the spacing and angles differ slightly from Image A, where they appear more precisely grouped and aligned. Image B shows a more casual distribution, which may be due to adjustments made during the 3D modeling process to fit the stylized rendering of the image.",

      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the 3D chibi-style bicycles align naturally with the light source and the floor, contributing to the overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows in Image B are stylized to match the overall chibi aesthetic. They mimic the positions and general shapes of the bicycles but are simplified and appear less precise compared to Image A, where the shadows are more accurately aligned with the bicyclesâ€™ components. This difference suggests a focus on artistic rather than realistic portrayal in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the wheels, frames, and other components of the 3D chibi-style bicycles retained their fine details without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles are simplified and stylized, meaning many realistic details and fine components are reduced or omitted, which is typical in chibi-style representation. In contrast, Image A showcases bicycles with well-defined details such as gearing, spokes, and realistic frames. This transformation reflects an artistic decision for simplification rather than maintaining detailed authenticity.",
