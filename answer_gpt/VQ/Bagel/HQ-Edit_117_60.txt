    "Question": "Q1: Are the sails rendered as smooth, polished walnut with visible and consistent grain patterns that mimic real wood, without artificial sheen or texture repetition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sails are depicted with a smooth surface and distinct grain patterns that mimic real wood. The texture appears consistent and natural, suggesting that it is modeled after walnut wood with a polished finish. There is no repeated texture or artificial sheen observed, which would otherwise indicate synthetic materials. These visual cues support the conclusion that the sails are rendered as described.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the hull display deep, textured carvings that resemble individual walnut planks with natural variations in thickness and spacing, preserving the original boat’s silhouette without distortion?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the hull with clear carvings that resemble wooden planks. The carvings follow natural variations typical of individual planks, indicating depth and texture characteristic of real wood. The silhouette of the hull appears intact and accurately preserved, with no visible distortion from the original structure. These observations confirm that the hull maintains the specified characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the boat positioned on a sleek, pale beige pedestal that is properly grounded and aligned with the boat’s base, without appearing to float or disconnect from the surface?",
    "explanation": "The boat in Image B is supported by a pedestal that appears pale beige and maintains a sleek appearance. It visually integrates with the base of the boat, creating the impression that the boat is properly grounded. There is no gap or disconnect between the boat and the pedestal observed, which indicates proper alignment and a stable position.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the wood tones across the sails and hull show natural variation in color and reflectivity under the ambient light, without uniformity or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays wood tones on the sails and hull with a range of colors typical of natural wood. The variation suggests different exposure to ambient light, which is common for walnut wood. The tones do not appear uniformly or artificially highlighted, indicating a realistic rendering of wood under natural lighting conditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are all structural elements such as the mast, rigging, and deck preserved in correct alignment and proportion relative to each other, without stretching, bending, or missing parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structural elements, including the mast and sails, appear accurately proportioned and well-aligned. There are no indications of stretching, bending, or missing components in the structure of the boat, suggesting that these elements have been preserved and represented correctly relative to each other.",
    "answer": "Yes"
