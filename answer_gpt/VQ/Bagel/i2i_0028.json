        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person's face is drawn with smooth, simple lines typical of soft illustration styles, which often simplify features for charm and warmth, rather than depicting realistic shading and textures. Therefore, while coherent within the style, it lacks natural shading and texture.",
