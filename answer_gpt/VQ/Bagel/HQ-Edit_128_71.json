      "question": "Does the scaled-down Statue of Liberty retain correct proportions between its head, torso, arms, and legs without any visible stretching or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Statue of Liberty appears to be scaled down and housed within a glass lantern. The proportions of the statue's head, torso, arms, and legs seem consistent with its original form, with no visible signs of stretching or compression, maintaining the correct proportions similar to how the original statue is designed.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the green and copper hues on the statue’s surface distributed naturally with variations in tone and texture resembling real patina formation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the miniature Statue of Liberty shows variations in green and copper hues, which resemble a patina texture found on aged copper structures. The changes in tone and texture across its surface suggest a natural formation, consistent with real patina effects on statues like the original in New York.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass lantern transparent with visible reflections and refractions, and do its edges appear smooth without jagged lines or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the glass lantern encasing the statue, which appears transparent, allowing clear visibility of the statue inside. The lantern displays reflections and refraction, characteristic of real glass, and the edges of the glass are smooth, lacking jagged lines or digital artifacts, indicating high visual quality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pastel skyline composed of smooth color gradients and softly defined building silhouettes without abrupt color changes or banding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastel hues form a gradient in the skyline, transitioning smoothly without abrupt color changes or banding. The buildings in the background are softly defined, consistent with a stylized skyline often depicted in illustrative settings.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the ships and waves beneath the statue appropriately sized relative to the statue and do they exhibit natural shapes and wave patterns without repetition or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ships and waves at the base of Image B's statue are depicted proportionally to the statue's size, representing realistic elements. Their shapes and patterns avoid unnatural repetition or distortion, enhancing the cohesive visual narrative of the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the revolving mechanism at the base integrated seamlessly with the lantern’s structure, with all components properly aligned and grounded without floating or misaligned parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the structure of the lantern and statue's base seems properly aligned, without any components appearing to float or be misaligned. The integration of parts ensures that the lantern apparatus appears seamless and functional within the visual setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all elements in the scene—including the statue, glass lantern, ships, and waves—cast shadows consistent with a single light source and show uniform lighting without conflicting highlights or dark spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting across the elements—statue, glass lantern, ships, and waves—shows consistent shadows and highlights indicative of a single light source. The scene is uniformly lit, avoiding conflicting highlights, which contributes to a coherent visual atmosphere.",
