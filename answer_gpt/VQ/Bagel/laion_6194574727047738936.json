      "question": "Are the facial features and tiny hands added to each cereal bar proportionally sized and positioned in a way that maintains the original rectangular shape of the bars without distorting their geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the cereal bars have been given cartoon-like facial features and tiny hands. These are added in a whimsical, exaggerated manner typical of cartoon styles, which often don't strictly adhere to proportional sizes as in real life. However, the position of these features seems to maintain the general shape of the bars; the bars still appear rectangular without significant distortion in their base geometry. The characters maintain the core shape of the bars while adding playful elements.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cereal bar characters appear to interact with the pink flamingo mug in a physically plausible manner, such as touching or leaning toward it, without violating spatial logic or causing visual inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the cereal bar characters are positioned around the pink flamingo mug in a way that suggests a thematic relationship but not a direct physical interaction. The design seems to place them near or around the mug but not in a manner that shows physical contact or interaction. This preserves spatial logic as the characters do not overlap with or improperly connect to the mug, keeping visual consistency intact.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the whimsical font placed above the cereal bar characters clearly legible, properly aligned, and free from artifacts such as jagged edges or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a whimsical font above the cereal bar characters that appears clear and legible. The font is properly aligned in a visually appealing way that fits well with the overall design aesthetic. The characters and letters are smooth and free from artifacts such as jagged edges or blurring, which ensures that the text is easy to read and visually coherent with the rest of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the added facial features and hands on the cereal bars preserve the original texture of the chocolate and cereal layers, without introducing unnatural smoothness, sharp edges, or missing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon-like facial features and hands added to the cereal bars inherently alter the visual texture due to their illustration style. While they do introduce a smoothness typical of animated features, they do not completely eradicate the recognizable texture of chocolate and cereal. The intention was more about creating a characterful look than maintaining hyper-realism. Hence, while some textural details are simplified, the edit doesn't completely distort or misalign the core textures of the cereal bars.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tiny hands added to the cereal bars have a natural number of fingers (no more than five), proper curvature, and appropriate shadowing to match the lighting in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cereal bars are animated with tiny hands resembling simple cartoony appendages, which are often depicted with fewer than five fingers for stylistic reasons. These hands follow such a design principle, emphasizing simplicity over detailed anatomical accuracy. Despite this simplification, they are drawn with a curvature and shadowing that matches the whimsical lighting and style of the scene, making them visually coherent.",
