    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the curls in the hair rendered with consistent marble texture, showing natural variations in depth and surface detail without visible artifacts such as blurring, flattening, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The curls in the hair of Image B are visually consistent in their marble representation. The texture exhibits natural depth and surface detail typical of intricately carved marble. The shading appears consistent across the curls, without noticeable artifacts such as blurring or flattening that would disrupt the marble effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ornamental carvings on the neck and shoulders maintain anatomical alignment with the musculature and have continuous, coherent shapes without gaps, misaligned edges, or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ornamental carvings on the neck and shoulders of Image B align well with the underlying musculature, suggesting an understanding of anatomical structure. The carvings flow cohesively without gaps or misalignments, and do not exhibit any geometric distortions, maintaining the illusion of being part of the figure's anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the angelic figures in the background depicted with clear outlines, proper proportions, and consistent depth relative to the central figure, without appearing flat, distorted, or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the angelic figures in the background are depicted with clear outlines and maintain proportions that are appropriate relative to the central figure. There is a consistent sense of depth, and the figures do not appear flat or fragmented, showing a coherent artistic execution.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire image uniformly rendered in a monochrome palette with smooth gradients and no abrupt transitions between light and dark areas that suggest incomplete color conversion or artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is rendered in a monochrome palette, typical of marble sculptures, with smooth gradients from light to dark areas. The transitions are seamless, indicating a complete and accurate color conversion without any signs of artifacting or abrupt changes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do both hands display exactly five fingers each with natural joint articulation and realistic proportions, without fused digits, elongated limbs, or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands are depicted with five fingers each. The fingers are naturally articulated, exhibiting realistic proportions without any indication of fused digits, elongated limbs, or unnatural bending, which enhances the natural representation of the sculpture.",
