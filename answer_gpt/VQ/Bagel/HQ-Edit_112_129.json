      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass dome have natural transparency and refraction effects that match the lighting direction and shadow patterns from the window, without visible artifacts such as uneven edges or unrealistic glare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome encases the teapot and has a clear, smooth surface that matches the lighting in the scene. The dome shows realistic transparency and slight refraction effects as light interacts with it. The lighting appears to be coming from above and slightly to the side, casting appropriate shadows and causing natural light reflections on the dome. There are no visible artifacts like jagged edges or unrealistic glare impairing its appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the vintage wooden base visually consistent in color, texture, and grain pattern with the surrounding wooden table, and does the velvet lining appear soft and layered without pixelation or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base has a rich brown tone and texture that complements the wooden table beneath it. The texture and grain appear continuous and harmonious, showing an understanding of how similar wood types interact in color and pattern. The velvet lining at the base's top edge appears soft, well-rendered, and free from any pixelation or overly reflective sheen that would suggest artificiality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the flowering plants and ferns emerging from the spout and lid grow in a way that follows natural botanical form and maintains contact with the teapot's surface without floating or breaking geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plants are depicted with natural curvature and growth patterns typical of ferns and flowers. They appear rooted or anchored into the teapot's engravings, visually maintaining continuity and looking as if they are growing naturally along the surface. None of the plants seem to be floating or disrupting the geometry of the teapot.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the butterflies positioned at plausible flight heights and angles near the floral engravings, with visible wings and body details that match the scale and lighting of the scene, and do they cast subtle shadows on the teapot surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterflies hover close to the floral patterns, with positions and angles typical for butterflies interacting with flowers. Their positioning reflects a familiarity with butterfly behavior around blooms. The butterflies display detailed wings and bodies consistent with the image's light source; subtle shadows on the teapot surface enhance the realism and integrate them into the scene effectively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all newly added elements rendered in muted earth tones that blend seamlessly with the original silver teapot and wooden background, avoiding bright or jarring color contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the added elements such as the flowers, ferns, and butterflies are depicted in earth tones that harmonize with the existing muted color palette of the teapot and base. The colors are subdued and pleasant, staying true to a vintage and cohesive aesthetic without introducing any jarring contrasts or bright colors that would disrupt the overall scene.",
