      "question": "Does the claymation texture applied to the cocktail glass maintain its structural coherence without introducing unnatural textures or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cocktail glass is depicted using claymation styling. This style inherently simplifies and alters textures, resulting in softer and less detailed surfaces compared to a real glass. The structural coherence of the glass appears preserved, but the fine details are typical of claymation, which tend to be less intricate. Therefore, while it maintains structural coherence, it does introduce unnatural textures that are characteristic of claymation.",

      "question": "Do the ice cubes and liquid in the cocktail retain their visual plausibility and natural appearance after being converted into a claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typical characteristics of ice cubes and liquid are highly altered due to the claymation style. Instead of transparent ice cubes and liquid, the representation uses solid clay shapes without any translucence or fluidity. This transformation makes them appear less plausible and more stylized as clay objects, rather than natural ice and liquid.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the lime slice and straw preserved without distortion in the claymation design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime slice and straw are depicted in a way that maintains the basic geometric shapesâ€”round for the lime and cylindrical for the straw. However, the claymation style leads to physical distortions typical in such a medium, especially in the lime slice, which lacks detail and appears more rounded than precise. Thus while the general shapes are recognizable, they do suffer from distortion.",

      "question": "Does the background, including the bar counter and bottles, retain its structural integrity and visual coherence without introducing unnatural artifacts in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B completely transforms the setting into a unique clay creation, where the focus is solely on the glass and its components with no background details like the bar counter and bottles present. This absence means the background does not retain any structural integrity or coherence as found in Image A, it essentially is a neutral clay setting with no artifacts of a traditional scene.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the cocktail glass, napkin, and surrounding objects logically consistent in the claymation design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions appear altered to fit the claymation style. The glass is surrounded by exaggerated clay elements including hands and additional shaping peculiar to the artistic style, rather than logical placement relative to other objects. The physical relationships are stylized for artistic effect rather than consistency with real-world logic as seen in Image A.",
