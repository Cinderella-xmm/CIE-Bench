      "question": "Does the handwritten word \"Draft\" on the yellow paper appear seamlessly integrated without unnatural textures or color discrepancies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe the handwritten word 'Draft' on the yellow paper. The integration appears smooth and consistent, with no visible mismatches in texture or color with the surrounding paper surface. The handwriting does not introduce visible artifacts or texture differences, indicating a seamless edit. Therefore, the integration looks natural and without discrepancies.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the style and material of the handwritten word \"Draft\" visually consistent with the pencil used in the image and typical design sketches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a pencil writing the word 'Draft' on the yellow paper. The style of the handwriting appears to be typical of what a pencil might produceâ€”uniform thickness and a clear, bold appearance. The consistency in color and thickness aligns with common pencil marks used in sketches and design frameworks. Thus, the style is coherent with typical pencil usage in design sketches.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the addition of the handwritten word \"Draft\" preserved the structural integrity of the yellow paper, avoiding any distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the handwritten word 'Draft' maintains the alignment and structure of the yellow paper underneath without causing distortion or misalignment of the paper edges or surface. The paper appears flat, and the graphics appear accurately placed indicating that the structural integrity is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the handwritten word \"Draft\" sharp and clear, without introducing any unnatural blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the word 'Draft' on the paper are observed to be sharply defined, with no visible blurring or unnecessary pixelation that would detract from clarity. The clarity is consistent across the word, suggesting a high-quality integration of the text in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the pencil on the yellow paper remain physically logical and visually credible after adding the handwritten word \"Draft\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pencil is placed at a logical angle to be writing on the paper, where the word 'Draft' appears. The positioning of the pencil remains consistent with the action of writing, offering credibility to the scene being depicted as actively creating the word. The visual cues suggest that the image maintains physical logic with the handwriting addition.",
