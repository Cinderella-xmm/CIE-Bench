      "question": "Does the transformed house maintain consistent geometric shapes without jagged edges, overlapping planes, or unnatural fragmentation that disrupts structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation depicts the house in geometric abstraction, where the structure is broken into various angular and colorful shapes. These shapes do not overlap each other in a disruptive manner, instead they are arranged to form a coherent abstract version of the house. Despite being prismatic, the structural integrity is preserved by the orderly arrangement of shapes. Common sense and abstract art principles emphasize consistent shapes without jaggedness or overlap. Therefore, the house maintains consistent geometric shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the abstract representations of the crowd evenly distributed across their original positions without clustering or floating elements that violate spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crowd is represented by colorful geometric shapes that form a checkered pattern. These shapes are uniformly spread across the original position where the crowd was located in Image A. The representation does not show clustering or floating elements outside the intended area, indicating that spatial logic is preserved. The distribution is evenly maintained, aligning with the abstract style that avoids unnatural placement of shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the checkered pattern applied uniformly across the entire grass surface without visible seams, inconsistent spacing, or distortion at edges near sand traps and water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass is depicted with abstract vibrant shapes creating a checkered pattern that covers the entire surface including areas near sand traps and water. The pattern spacing remains consistent without visible seams or distortion, even at the edges. Logical application of patterns on surfaces ensures consistency, and this image maintains such uniformity across the grass surface.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the prismatic shards in the water reflect the house and sky in fragmented but coherent angular segments without ghosting, blurring, or unnatural color separation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water in Image B shows a prismatic reflection using colorful geometric shapes that match the fragmented style of the house. These reflections maintain angular coherence, with distinct segments that align with the abstract depiction above water. The shards preserve the impression of reflection without ghosting, blurring, or unnatural color separation, indicating logical application of abstraction principles in reflections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the vibrant geometric planes on the houseâ€™s facade consistently lit and shaded to match the ambient light direction, avoiding unnatural highlights or shadow mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the house with vibrant geometric planes, which are colored in a manner suggesting light and shadow consistency. The colors and shading are chosen to mimic light direction observed in the original scene, maintaining a reasonable amount of shadow and highlight balance that does not disrupt the abstract portrayed lighting. Hence, the lighting and shading on the facade appear logical and coherent with the ambient scene.",
