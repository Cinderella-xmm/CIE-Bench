    "Question": "Q1: Does the table appear transformed into a tea box lid with consistent geometry and engraved leaf patterns that follow natural contours without warping or breaking the surface structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the table is represented as a box lid with a smooth surface adorned with engraved leaf patterns. The contours and patterns are cleanly integrated onto the flat surface, maintaining uniform geometry without irregularities such as warping or misaligned edges. This reflects a deliberate transformation keeping structural integrity intact.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the replaced cups depicted with clear, detailed sustainable material textures (such as fibrous or layered patterns) that appear natural and integrated into the scene without visible artifacts or blurring?",
    "explanation": "The cups in Image B are replaced by a leaf contour distinct from any fibrous or layered textured appearance typically found in sustainable materials. Given its smooth surface and monochromatic style, there are no visible artifacts or blurring as no fibrous textures are intended.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the tag with the text 'Zen Autumn Tea' clearly legible, stylistically consistent with the sceneâ€™s aesthetic, and seamlessly integrated with proper lighting and shadow alignment to avoid appearing pasted on?",
    "explanation": "The tag in Image B features prominently displayed text 'Zen Autumn Tea,' which is clear and legible. The stylistic choice of handwritten-like font complements the serene, nature-focused aesthetic of the image. The tag's lighting and shadow align harmoniously with the scene, integrating seamlessly without appearing out of place or artificially glued on.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the teapot reshaped into a leaf contour with smooth, continuous edges and natural-looking earthy textures that do not show distortion, clipping, or unnatural color gradients?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a teapot is depicted separate from any leaf contour transformation. The green teapot retains its traditional shape with natural textures and smooth surfaces without distortion or clipping, and its color is consistent in gradient. However, the reshaping into a leaf contour is not evident.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do all edited elements (tea box lid, sustainable cups, brand tag, leaf-shaped teapot) align with the original lighting direction and cast consistent shadows, maintaining spatial harmony and depth without floating or misaligned components?",
    "explanation": "All elements in Image B, including the tea box lid, brand tag, and teapot (as not reshaped), align with a coherent lighting direction. Shadows are consistent, and no floating elements are visible. The integration of these objects maintains spatial harmony and depth without misalignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
