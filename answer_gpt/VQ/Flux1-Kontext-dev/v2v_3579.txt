    "Question": "Q1: Do the sushi pieces forming the human figure maintain a natural and coherent structure without any visible breaks or distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, some sushi pieces are used to form parts of a human figure's arm and shoulder atop the sushi map. The focus here is on whether these pieces maintain a coherent structure. Upon inspection, these sushi pieces appear to maintain a consistent form, matching the shape and texture of sushi pieces found in the original sushi map. There are no visible breaks or distortions in the connections between the sushi pieces forming the human figure, supporting the option that they maintain a natural structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the colors of the sushi pieces used to form the human figure consistent with the original sushi map, without any unnatural color variations?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the sushi pieces used to form the human figure are consistent with the colors seen in the original sushi map. The shades of orange, green, and white prevalent in Image B are coherent with the color tones found in the map, suggesting that the editing did not introduce any unnatural color variations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the edges of the sushi pieces forming the human figure sharp and well-defined, without any blurred or pixelated artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the edges of the sushi pieces used to form the human arm are well-defined and maintain the sharpness seen in the original sushi pieces. There do not appear to be any blurred or pixelated artifacts along these edges, pointing to a high-quality edit in the image overlay.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the sizes and shapes of the sushi pieces forming the human figure proportionate and realistic compared to the original sushi pieces, without any unnatural scaling or distortion?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows that the sushi pieces used for the human figure's arm are proportionate in size and shape relative to the rest of the map. They seamlessly blend with the surrounding pieces, maintaining a realistic appearance without evident distortion or scaling issues.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the positioning of the sushi pieces to form the lifted arm appear anatomically plausible, without any unnatural bends or angles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sushi pieces are arranged to resemble a lifted arm alongside the shoulder. While the curvature of the arm is visually plausible, there seems to be minor unnatural bending near the proximal end of the arm; however, it does not significantly detract from the overall anatomical plausibility. Proportionally, it appears feasible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
