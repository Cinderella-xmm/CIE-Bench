        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand on the left panel transitions into a tree branch with a smooth, continuous form and maintains five distinct fingers. The transition appears artistically styled but does not display abrupt geometric breaks or missing digits, which aligns with a surreal or artistic interpretation of a hand and branch combo.",
