      "question": "Do the arm-like appendages formed from the balconies maintain consistent proportions and smooth joints without jagged edges or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arm-like appendages are part of a robot structure. They exhibit mechanical precision, keeping consistent proportions reflecting typical robotic design where joints are smooth and movements are realistic. This is based on the smooth, rounded joints seen in robotic elements, and the absence of any jagged edges or unnatural bends indicates good design adherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glowing panels uniformly distributed across the window positions and do they emit light in a way that blends seamlessly with the surrounding surfaces without harsh halos or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing panels are well-distributed and integrate smoothly with the building-like head structure of the robot. The light emission from these panels appears consistent and does not exhibit any harsh halos or pixelation, reflecting the precision in digital rendering typical in high-quality CGI where lighting is carefully controlled and integrated with the surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the circuit patterns run along plausible structural lines (e.g., edges, corners) and exhibit consistent thickness and color without appearing as random overlays or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circuit patterns on the robot in Image B are laid along logical structural lines, such as edges and corners of the robot body. They maintain consistent thickness and color, avoiding random appearances. This is typical in robot designs where circuits are integrated seamlessly to mimic functionality and construction integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dynamic parts at the edges of the building connected to the main structure through visible mechanical links, and do they follow realistic pivot points without floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B shows dynamic parts at its edges, such as limbs, connected with visible mechanical links that adhere to realistic pivot points. This reflects the typical findings in robotics engineering, where components are mechanically integrated, ensuring they are not misaligned or floating.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the exposed gears positioned at structural junctions and scaled appropriately relative to the buildingâ€™s height and width, without appearing oversized or misaligned with surrounding features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays exposed gears located at structural junctions of the robot, scaled to harmonize with the robot's proportions. They are neither oversized nor misaligned, maintaining consistency in design, typical of robotic engineering where exposed elements align with the structure's overall form.",
