    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes positioned just below the label and do they follow the curvature of the bottle with consistent lighting and reflection?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible reference to eyes below the label. The label region primarily consists of text and a logo. The lighting and reflection on the bottle do appear consistent, but the question about specific 'eyes' doesn't apply in this context. Hence, based on visual analysis, there's no depiction of eyes as described.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the vines wrap around the bottle in a continuous, physically plausible manner without floating or intersecting the bottle in an unnatural way?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vines are carefully wrapped around the bottle, touching its surface and following its contours. They do not appear to float or intersect the bottle unnaturally, suggesting an intentional design that's meant to look realistic and visually cohesive.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the modified label icon a clear, proportionate face with distinct features that match the original icon's style and size?",
    "explanation": "The label icon in Image B somewhat mimics the original in terms of being a simple, cartoon-like figure. Although it is partially blurred, the design attempts to retain similar stylistic elements which include a simplistic face and matching size proportion relative to the bottle label, aligning with the original style seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the background include layered grapevines and mist that recede naturally without obscuring or clipping the bottle incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background illustrates a forest with grapevines and mist. These elements are layered in a way that provides depth while ensuring the bottle remains unobscured and fully visible. The visual separation is clear and distinct, supporting a natural and balanced depth of field.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the title 'The Curious Scarecrow Wine Adventure' clearly visible, correctly positioned, and free from rendering artifacts such as pixelation or color bleeding?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the title appears on the label but is somewhat blended with the background color, making it less visible compared to a typical clear rendering. The text design and placement align with standard label positioning, but due to design alterations or editing limitations, there may be slight artifacts affecting visual clarity.",
    "answer": "No"
