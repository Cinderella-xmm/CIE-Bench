    "Question": "Q1: Are the transformed lanterns now depicted as balloons with consistent spherical shapes, smooth surfaces, and realistic lighting effects that match their surrounding environment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the objects above the scene appear as spherical forms resembling balloons rather than traditional lanterns, indicated by their consistent round shapes and smooth surfaces. They exhibit a lighting effect that matches the surrounding, similar to characteristic reflections found on balloons. This implies integration consistent with the scene's lighting and environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the exaggerated patterns on the kimono display continuous, flowing designs with consistent texture and color gradients that resemble real fabric without visible digital artifacts or breaks in pattern continuity?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a kimono with exaggerated and cartoonish patterns, suggesting a vibrant design, but it lacks realistic texture and color gradients resembling real fabric. The simplified representation fits the cartoon style and presents no obvious digital artifacts, but its cartoonish nature inherently introduces breaks from realistic fabric design.",
