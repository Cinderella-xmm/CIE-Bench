      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the standing cat’s body exhibit a uniformly soft, plush-like texture with exaggeratedly round and fluffy features throughout, without any visible patches of natural fur or inconsistent material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing cat displays a natural fur texture, characterized by clearly visible fur patterns and a realistic appearance. The texture does not exhibit a uniformly plush-like quality, as there are no exaggerated round or fluffy features typical of a plush toy. The fur appears realistic with natural variations, rather than a uniform softness indicative of plush materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes of both cats replaced with small, shiny, circular button-like objects and the noses with flat, felt-like shapes that are proportionally appropriate and seamlessly integrated into the plush form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of both cats appear natural, having realistic reflections and appropriate proportions. They do not resemble small, shiny button-like objects typical of plush toys. Similarly, the noses appear natural and do not have the flat, felt-like shape associated with plush figures. This indicates that the features are realistic rather than altered to match a plush toy aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the red shopping cart correctly scaled to fit the toy-sized cats and does it retain proper geometric structure with undistorted bars, wheels, and handle, without any broken or warped components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red shopping cart appears to be correctly scaled for the small cats, suggesting a toy-like proportioning. The cart maintains a proper geometric structure; the bars, wheels, and handle are not distorted or warped, preserving the cart's integrity. This indicates a well-scaled and accurately depicted shopping cart in relation to the cats.",

      "question": "Is the background composed of vivid, lush green foliage with natural textures and lighting that provide a clear contrast to the toy cats without any unnatural color shifts or blurred edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of vivid, lush green foliage that shows natural texture and lighting. This foliage effectively contrasts with the cats in the foreground. The image does not exhibit unnatural color shifts or blurred edges, maintaining a clear and realistic background setting.",

      "question": "Does the standing cat’s front paws properly grip the handle of the trolley in a stable and anatomically plausible manner for a plush toy figure, without unnatural bending or stretching of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing cat's front paws grip the handle of the trolley in a stable and plausible manner. The cat's limbs do not exhibit any unnatural bending or stretching, maintaining an anatomically sensible posture. This grip is consistent with natural movement rather than that of a plush toy figure.",
