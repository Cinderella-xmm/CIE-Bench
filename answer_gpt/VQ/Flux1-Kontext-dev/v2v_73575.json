      "question": "Does the origami bird on the left retain a natural appearance with no visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a bird designed with origami-like detail, which inherently includes visible textures from the fold lines and printed map patterns akin to paper. These characteristics are integral to its design and are visually intentional, reflecting an origami creation rather than an attempt to mimic a live bird with seamless plumage.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the luminous crystalline structure of the bird on the right visually credible without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird on the right in Image B is depicted as having a clear, crystalline structure with visible patterns of complex internal geometries akin to ice or glass. It displays smooth lines and intricate detail without visible distortions or broken geometric shapes, supporting its visual credibility as a crystalline sculpture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colossal, intricately carved ivory chess rooks structurally consistent with the birds perched on them, avoiding any visual distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds are perched on large, chess rook-like structures. These wooden bases are symmetrically designed and appear visually consistent with the birds they support, maintaining structural harmony with no apparent distortions in the interaction between the birds and the chess rook elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the surreal library setting with drifting books maintain visual plausibility without introducing any unnatural artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a library backdrop with shelves neatly lined with books, lighting is consistent, and spatial depth is maintained appropriately, indicating visual plausibility in terms of spatial setting and architectural design without introducing visible artifacts or inconsistencies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image as a whole maintain structural coherence and visual credibility, with all elements appearing naturally integrated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits structural coherence across its diverse elements, including the origami bird, crystalline structure, chess rook-like bases, and the library setting, all of which are visually consistent with the theme of an artistic, surreal environment without evident disjunction or aesthetic clash.",
