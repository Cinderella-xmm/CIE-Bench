    "Question": "Q1: Are the geometric patterns on the dress preserved as continuous, non-distorted shapes without broken edges or misaligned tiles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric patterns on the dress retain their original shapes, but they appear altered into a mosaic-like texture. Despite this texture change, the shapes themselves remain distinguishable without broken edges or major distortions. The patterns continue to appear symmetrical and correctly aligned, with no visible misalignment or disruption due to the editing effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the necklaces appear as flat, transparent stained glass tiles with consistent color gradients and no jagged or pixelated edges?",
    "explanation": "The necklaces in Image B exhibit a textured appearance similar to that of stained glass or a cracked surface, fitting the artistic style applied to the image. This effect leads to a consistent pattern and color distribution, avoiding jagged or pixelated edges, maintaining a smooth and cohesive look, though the texture overrides any transparency or flatness.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the individual braids still distinguishable and proportionally accurate, with smooth transitions between segments and no collapsed or fused strands?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although the braids have been subjected to the stylized editing that adds an artistic overlay, each braid remains distinctly recognizable. The proportional accuracy is maintained, as are smooth transitions between segments, with no collapse or fusion observed between the strands.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the background display varied textures and elevation changes consistent with natural terrain, without uniform patches or unnatural color blending?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is more stylized with a texture that mimics an artistic pattern overlay. While the overall terrain features and elevation changes are still discernible, the uniform textured pattern and altered colors create a more artificial appearance, lacking the natural color blending and variation seen in natural settings.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the bracelets on both arms symmetrically positioned, correctly numbered, and free from distortion such as stretching or overlapping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the artistic effect alters the texture and colors, the bracelets retain their original number, position, and symmetry on both arms. They do not showcase any visible distortion, stretching, or overlapping, maintaining their geometric integrity despite the stylistic changes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
