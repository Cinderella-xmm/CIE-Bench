    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the front view of the apple maintain its original texture and color without any noticeable artifacts or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front view of the apple shows a consistent texture without noticeable artifacts, retaining a realistic appearance. The color is vibrant and there is no evidence of unnatural smoothing. World knowledge supports that a natural apple surface would have slight variations in texture which are present here.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the cross-section reveal a natural, detailed texture of the apple's flesh, avoiding any unnatural or overly smooth appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cross-section of the apple displays a natural texture with visible fibers and seed chambers. The appearance is consistent with what is expected from a real apple, without signs of excessive smoothing that would make it look artificial.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the top view of the appleâ€™s stem and calyx accurately represented with natural proportions and geometry, without any obvious distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top view of the apple shows the stem and calyx with realistic proportions and geometry. There are no visible distortions or artifacts, consistent with the natural appearance of an apple's top. World knowledge informs that the calyx is typically symmetrical and the stem slightly off-center, as seen here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shapes, sizes, and textures of the apple consistent across the front view, cross-section, and top view, ensuring structural coherence without any contradictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the apple in various views and all maintain consistent shapes and sizes. The texture is coherent across the sections, supporting the realistic representation and structure of the apple without contradictions that would indicate editing errors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows in the cross-section and top view appear natural and consistent with those in the front view, contributing to a unified appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows are consistent across views. The shadowing in each perspective reflects a natural and uniform light source. World knowledge of consistent lighting encourages a cohesive and unified appearance as demonstrated between the different perspectives.",
