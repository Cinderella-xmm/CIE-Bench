    "Question": "Q1: Are the leadwork outlines along the spiral vortex continuous, following the curve without gaps, overlaps, or abrupt breaks?",
    "explanation": "Based on Image B, the spiral vortex is segmented by thick black outlines resembling leadwork, and these lines follow the spiral's curvature continuously without noticeable gaps, overlaps, or abrupt breaks. Each segment of the spiral is distinctly bordered, which is typical of stained glass designs where leadwork provides separation and definition.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the jewel-toned colors applied to the sky and tree canopies transition smoothly without visible color banding or unnatural patches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the application of colors to the sky and tree canopies shows a range of vibrant jewel tones such as blues, pinks, and oranges. These colors blend smoothly, with no visible banding or patches that appear unnatural when transitioning between hues. This suggests a deliberate and skilled handling of color gradients, common in illustrations that emphasize visual harmony.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the faceted glass textures applied uniformly across the spiral and trees, showing clear refraction effects without blurring or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "The texture in Image B appears flat and illustrative; the spiral and trees employ bold lines and solid fills rather than faceted glass textures that exhibit refractive effects. While the design hints at stained glass, there is no evidence of refraction effects or variations indicative of glass facets. The detail is clear, but it relies on graphic style rather than textured realism.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the leadwork lines form clean, unbroken borders around the spiral, trees, and horizon without intersecting incorrectly or creating floating segments?",
    "explanation": "The leadwork lines in Image B are clean and unbroken, correctly outlining the spiral, trees, and horizon. The lines do not intersect incorrectly nor do they create floating segments. Each element is clearly defined with distinct borders that are characteristic of stained glass artwork, where leadwork is used to ensure separation and stability.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the individual stars within the spiral and the reflections on the water surface still distinguishable and not obscured by the glass texture or color saturation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the individual stars within the spiral are represented as dots of colored light, distinguishable against the vibrant background. The reflections on the water are simplified and stylized, suggesting a reflection but without detailed star representation. While the colors are saturated, they do not obstruct the star-like features within the spiral; however, the water lacks distinguishable star reflections due to the stylized approach.",
    "answer": "Yes"
