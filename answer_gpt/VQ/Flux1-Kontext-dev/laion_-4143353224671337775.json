      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the beige and brown puzzle pieces uniformly aligned and interlocked across the surface of the sculpture without visible gaps, misalignments, or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the puzzle pieces are depicted with clean edges, and appear seamlessly interlocked, showcasing careful alignment. The consistency in shape and connection suggests a uniform surface without irregularities. This conclusion is drawn from the visual presentation of smooth transitions between pieces. Given these observations, the interlocking appears smooth and without significant gaps or jagged edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the edges of the puzzle pieces follow the natural curvature of the original ceramic head shape without abrupt angular deviations or unnatural flattening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the puzzle pieces are shaped to fit the spherical form of the sculpture similarly to the original ceramic shape. The edges follow a gentle curve, which indicates adherence to the natural shape of the head. The absence of abrupt angular deviations or flattening suggests the puzzle pieces respect the original curvature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the green puzzle fragment on the top of the head smooth and free of rough textures, cracks, or color variations that contrast with the surrounding beige and brown puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green puzzle piece shown in Image B appears smooth and consistent in texture, lacking any roughness or visible cracks. Its color is solid and does not present contrasting variations that would significantly differ from the surrounding puzzle pieces. The uniform texture and color suggest a cohesive design across the surface.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed horizontally on the white shelf with stable contact and no floating or tilting effects, maintaining a natural shadow and perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sculpture resting evenly on the flat, white shelf, demonstrating stable contact without signs of floating or tilting. The consistent shadowing and perspective align with the expectation of horizontal placement, indicating stability in its positioning.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, eyebrows, mouth, ears) clearly preserved in shape and proportion despite being integrated into the puzzle piece design, without deformation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are integrated as design elements within the puzzle pieces. However, the provided image does not depict them clearly due to intentional blurring. As such, based on what is visible, the features are not discernible enough to confidently assess preservation in shape and proportion.",
