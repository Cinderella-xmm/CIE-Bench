      "question": "Does the perfume bottle appear to be constructed from Lego bricks without any visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle maintains clear structure and design cues indicating it's made of glass with a golden top. Examining the texture and materials, there is no evidence of Lego brick construction; the appearance remains consistent with a traditional glass bottle. Thus, based on these visual cues, the bottle does not exhibit characteristics of Lego construction.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the fabric background transformed into Lego bricks maintain a natural appearance without any obvious distortions or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the fabric background replaced by interwoven Lego bricks. Common sense indicates natural fabric has flowing and soft shapes, which are absent here, replaced by rigid, geometric structures typical of Lego. This transformation results in unnatural shapes and contrasts sharply with realistic fabric depiction.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the perfume bottle and the fabric background preserved, avoiding any distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle remains proportionate, similar to Image A, maintaining realistic geometry. However, the Lego brick background disrupts the natural curves and folds seen in authentic fabric, presenting distorted geometry. While the bottle itself is correct, the background does not preserve rational proportions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the edited image, with the perfume bottle and fabric background made of Lego bricks, retain visual credibility and coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a Lego boxed setting for the perfume bottle, with the fabric replaced by distinct Lego structures. While the perfume bottle remains credible, the backdrop does not blend naturally due to the contrast between flexible fabric and rigid Lego bricks. This juxtaposition reduces overall coherence and credibility.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the perfume bottle and the fabric background accurately represented in the Lego brick form without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle is captured accurately with fine details preserved, aligning with original representation in Image A. However, the Lego transformation of the fabric background fails to capture the intricate folds and texture of real fabric, resulting in a loss of detail and texture.",
