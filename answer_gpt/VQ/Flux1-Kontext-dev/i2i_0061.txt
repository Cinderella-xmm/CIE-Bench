    "Question": "Q1: Does the watercolor effect applied across the image retain the structural coherence of the skater's pose and the ramp's form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor effect maintains the basic outlines and structure of both the skater's pose and the ramp, giving the impression of a continuous action and clarity of form. The gestures and angles are preserved well enough to recognize the activity and the skater's position relative to the ramp. This indicates that despite the watercolor effect, the overall shape and movement remain coherent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the semi-abstract brushstrokes and blurred colors used for the ground and background buildings free from unnatural textures and artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor effect uses semi-abstract brushstrokes that create a more artistic representation of the ground and background. The textures are smooth and consistent with typical watercolor effects, lacking any jarring or unnatural artifacts. The colors blend gently, which is characteristic of watercolor painting, maintaining a natural look overall.",

    "Question": "Q4: Do the details on the skater's gray t-shirt and black shoes remain discernible after the watercolor treatment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the details on the skater's gray t-shirt and black shoes are somewhat less distinct compared to Image A due to the watercolor effect. While the general shape and color of the t-shirt and shoes are maintained, fine details and textures are lost, which is a characteristic of the watercolor style.",

    "Question": "Q5: Have the shapes and lines of the skater’s hands remained ergonomic and natural under the watercolor transformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's hands, though rendered in a watercolor style, maintain natural shapes and ergonomic positioning in line with how a person would naturally move. The overall form and position of the hands are preserved, reflecting a fluid and natural motion despite the stylistic change.",
