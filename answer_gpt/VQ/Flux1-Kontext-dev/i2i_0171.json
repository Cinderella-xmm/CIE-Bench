      "question": "Do the skis appear naturally detached from the skier with no visible artifacts or unnatural distortions in their shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skier's skis are represented as part of a figurine set. When visually assessing them, it is important to ensure that the skis look intact, with no unrealistic bends or distortions. Observing the image, the skis do appear smooth and undistorted, maintaining their expected shape and form. This suggests a natural appearance without visible artifacts.",

      "question": "Does the magnetic snow powder base integrate seamlessly into the snowy landscape without introducing unnatural textures or breaking the scene's structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a figurine with a snow powder base intended to represent snow. The key factor here is whether this base maintains a consistent appearance with the surrounding snowy environment. While the base visibly supports the figurine, it doesn't appear to jarringly disrupt the scene with any unnatural textures, maintaining coherence in the overall snowy theme.",

      "question": "Are the skier's facial features and body proportions accurately preserved in the figurine form, avoiding any distortions or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation of the skier into a figurine in Image B requires attention to maintaining accurate proportions. The figurine should mirror the body shape and positioning seen in Image A. The skier's posture, attire, and body proportions in the figurine appear credible, preserving detail without apparent distortion.",

      "question": "Do the packaging illustrations match the visual style and natural appearance of the skier and mountain environment without introducing any unnatural elements or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B displays an illustration of the skier and the mountainous background. A correct match would maintain the natural aesthetics and respect for visual style seen in the original image. The depiction on the packaging shows a consistent visual style with harmonious integration into the mountain backdrop similar to Image A.",

      "question": "Are the skier's hands, ski poles, and posture anatomically correct and visually credible compared to the original image, with no unnatural shapes or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B's figurine to Image A, the skier's posture and limb positioning need to align realistically. The figurine in Image B maintains the anatomical correctness of hand positions and ski pole angles, mirroring closely the original image's action stance without introducing visual distortions.",
