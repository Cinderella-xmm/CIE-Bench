      "question": "Do the transformed buildings exhibit smooth, metallic textures without unnatural pixelation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows buildings that have a uniform, smooth texture, typical of metallic surfaces. These surfaces are depicted sharply without signs of pixelation or blurring, indicative of a careful digital rendering process. By analyzing the reflectivity and surface quality in Image B, which resembles polished metal, it matches the characteristics of a high-quality digital illustration, free from distortions like pixelation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossom trees and traditional architectural features like the pagoda seamlessly integrated with the futuristic buildings without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossom trees are gracefully combined with both the modern building elements and traditional architectural features. The trees blend well with the scene, maintaining a natural look without feeling segmented or improperly layered. This integration is achieved by ensuring a consistent art style and color palette that harmonizes across the old and new architectural components.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the proportions and shapes of the buildings been preserved logically, ensuring no broken or distorted geometric forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the logical proportions and geometric symmetry expected in architectural structures. The buildings feature straight lines, consistent angles, and regular shapes typical of well-crafted architectural renderings. This indicates that the transformations were done while respecting structural integrity and design principles, avoiding any eccentric or distorted forms that would otherwise appear unrealistic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the buildings, such as window frames and roof edges, clearly visible and free from unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, fine details like window frames and roof edges are depicted sharply, with clear outlines and consistent textures that match the style of digital art rendering. The surfaces, including roofs and intricate building elements, are free from artifacts such as blurriness or pixelated noise, ensuring clarity and precision in their depiction.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the scene, including the placement of the buildings and cherry blossom trees, appear visually credible and harmonious?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout in Image B demonstrates an effective use of space where buildings and cherry blossom trees are positioned logically and aesthetically. The perspective is consistent and supports the flow of the scene, creating an immersive and harmonious visual experience. The scene's composition extends naturally between the modern and traditional elements, showing an understanding of visual dynamics and scene balance.",
