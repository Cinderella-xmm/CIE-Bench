        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bread slice used for the character's head retains visible crumb texture and the crust's edge looks natural, similar to how a real bread slice would appear. No smoothing out or distortions that would make it look artificial are evident.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

Hence, there are no facial features that appear detached or misaligned.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the lettuce leaves making up the cape have consistent texture and visually demonstrate natural curling, similar to real lettuce, without any flat or monochrome sections. This indicates attention to detail in the illustration.",
