      "question": "Does the transformation into a comic book style maintain the natural appearance of the chimney sweep and his equipment without introducing unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chimney sweep and his equipment have been transformed to a comic book style. This style introduces bold outlines and a halftone shading technique, common in comic illustrations, giving the elements a slightly exaggerated, graphic feel. However, these changes are stylistic rather than artifact-related, and the essential features of the sweep, such as the brush and the hose, remain recognizable and consistent with their intended forms.",

      "question": "Does the added cityscape integrate naturally with the chimney sweep and the brick chimney without disrupting the visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cityscape serves as a backdrop that complements the chimney sweep and the brick chimney. The use of similar illustration textures and color themes helps in integrating these elements. The presence of urban elements supports the theme of a chimney sweep working in a city, thereby enhancing the narrative without seeming out of place.",

      "question": "Does the yellow circle enhance the visual impact as a dramatic background element without causing distortion or breaking the geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow circle is used as a bold backdrop that draws attention to the chimney sweep at the center. Its solid form with halftone shading maintains geometric integrity, emphasizing the central figure without introducing distortion. It enhances the image's overall drama by contrasting with the darker elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bold outlines and dramatic halftone shading preserve the structural consistency and avoid degrading fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artistic style in Image B utilizes bold outlining and halftone shading to create a dramatic effect. While this can simplify finer details typical in a comic style, it maintains the integrity of larger structures and key features, such as the distinct elements of the chimney sweep. The structural consistency is maintained as these methods are strategically applied to enhance rather than obscure the sweep's important features.",

      "question": "Does the gritty caption at the bottom complement the overall image without causing visual clutter or disrupting the natural flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The caption 'JUST ANOTHER DAY CLEANING TS CITY'S LUNGS' at the bottom of Image B uses a bold, straightforward font that suits the gritty comic book style. It occupies the bottom space neatly without interfering with the main elements of the illustration above and complements the narrative by adding a thematic text element without cluttering the scene.",
