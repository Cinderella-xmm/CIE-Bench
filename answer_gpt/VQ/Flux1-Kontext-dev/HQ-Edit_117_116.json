    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the wings display a smooth, translucent gradient resembling flowing water without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural banding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragonfly's wings exhibit a smooth gradient with a natural flow akin to flowing water. The gradient transitions seamlessly, without any noticeable pixelation or jagged edges, maintaining its fluidity and translucency. By observing the wings, it is clear that the gradient is designed to mimic the appearance of water, with no unnatural banding visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scales on the dragonfly’s body evenly distributed, aligned with its natural segmentation, and do they exhibit smooth color transitions without abrupt edges or repetitive patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scales on the dragonfly’s body are meticulously arranged, following the natural segmentation of the dragonfly's anatomy. The coloration transitions smoothly across the scales, enhancing the realism without any abrupt edges or repetitive patterns that could disrupt the uniformity of the dragonfly's appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the eyes retain their spherical shape and contain layered, dark blue internal structures that suggest depth, without appearing flattened or unnaturally textured?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragonfly’s eyes in Image B are spherical, displaying layered dark blue structures which suggest a sense of depth. This internal structure avoids a flattened appearance, maintaining a realistic texture without any unnatural characteristics, thereby contributing to the overall believability of the dragonfly's features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the aquatic vines wrapped around the dragonfly’s legs in a continuous, non-intersecting manner, with a soft glowing edge that does not bleed into surrounding areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aquatic vines appear to wrap around the dragonfly’s legs in a continuous way, avoiding intersections that would imply a lack of coherence. The vines feature a soft glowing edge that remains confined to their form without bleeding into adjacent areas, enhancing the precision of the design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mist evenly diffused around the dragonfly, fading gradually into the air without sharp edges, clumping, or unnatural brightness spikes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mist in Image B disperses evenly around the dragonfly, with a consistent and gradual fade into the surrounding air. There are no sharp edges, clumping, or unnatural brightness spikes, maintaining a smooth and realistic atmospheric effect around the dragonfly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the reflection in the water accurately depict the edited dragonfly’s features, including wings, body patterns, and vines, with appropriate distortion and reduced brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection of the dragonfly in the water in Image B accurately replicates the features of the edited dragonfly, including the wings, body patterns, and vines. The reflection is appropriately distorted as one would expect in a water surface and has a reduced brightness that is characteristic of such reflections, enhancing the realism of the scene.",
