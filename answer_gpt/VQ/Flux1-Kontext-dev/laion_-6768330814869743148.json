      "question": "Do the pastries in the edited image maintain their original shapes without distorted or stretched forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries maintain clear, distinct outlines but are stylized with bright colors and patterns reminiscent of pop art. Despite these artistic alterations, the essential forms are still recognizable as pastries similar to how they appear in Image A. Analyzing visually, they do not appear distorted or stretched in any unnatural way.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bread slices' internal textures clearly visible and consistent with real bread, or do they appear overly stylized with uniform patterns that lack natural variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bread slices showcase stylized textures that adhere to a pop art aesthetic. The patterns are uniform and lack the natural variation typically seen in real bread, especially compared to Image A where the bread textures depict actual grain and irregularity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the muffin liners show clear geometric patterns that still align with the shape of the muffins and do not float or detach from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the muffin liners have been colored and stylized according to the pop art theme with patterns and colors. They align with the muffins and appear integrated into the artistic design, rather than detached or floating away, similar in positioning to Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the checkerboard pattern applied uniformly across the tray surfaces without breaking the perceived depth or causing unnatural flatness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a stylized checkerboard pattern that covers the tray surfaces, creating a flat, uniform look consistent with pop art. While this impacts the natural perception of depth compared to Image A, within the context of Image B's style, the pattern appears consistently applied without breaking due to any internal inconsistencies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the abstract shapes in the background positioned in a way that matches the depth and alignment of the original cup stack, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the abstract shapes, derived from the pop art transformation, do not retain the original depth and alignment seen in the cup stack of Image A. They have shifted from realistic placement to a design intended more for visual interest rather than spatial accuracy.",
