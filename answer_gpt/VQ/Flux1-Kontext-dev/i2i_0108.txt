    "Question": "Q1: Does the boundary where the character appears to break out of the television screen show no obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted as part of the screen projecting outward, creating a 3D effect. The boundary where the character appears to break through the screen shows a smooth transition without visible artifacts or jagged edges, maintaining a coherent look. This suggests that the image editing was done with care to ensure natural blending.",
