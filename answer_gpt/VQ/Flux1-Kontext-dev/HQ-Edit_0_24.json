    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the enhanced flowers exhibit vivid but natural color gradients and soft, detailed textures without visible artifacts like oversharpening or color smearing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers display vibrant colors with natural gradients. Detail is maintained through soft textures that mimic real petals, avoiding oversharpening or color smearing common in poorly edited images. This assessment is based on observing clear transitions between colors without harsh lines or exaggerated edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the shovel and watering can visually consistent with antique metal objects, showing realistic surface textures like tarnish and reflections without unnatural gloss or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shovel and watering can in Image B were carefully observed for texture and reflectivity. They exhibit a matte finish typical of old metal objects, with realistic reflections and tarnish but lacking overly shiny surfaces or distorted reflections, aligning with the characteristics of aged metal tools.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the vine motif background subtly integrated into the image without obscuring primary elements or causing visible layering artifacts at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vine motif background painstakingly frames the scene without blocking main details, providing a continuous transition to the floral garden setting. There is no evidence of layering issues like abrupt edge transitions, allowing the motif to blend naturally into the perimeter.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the ornate leafy frame around the blank header have smooth, continuous shapes with natural leaf contours and consistent lighting, without geometric distortions or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leafy frame in Image B is examined for consistency in shape and lighting. The leaves maintain fluid, natural contours without geometric distortion and are uniformly lit, avoiding clipping issues at edges, resulting in a cohesive, uninterrupted ornamental design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the woman's right hand show five correctly shaped fingers with natural skin texture and grip posture, without extra digits or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman's right hand in Image B has been noted to depict five fingers, all with realistic form and texture. The fingers hold the shovel in a typical grip, without displaying any unnatural shapes, superfluous digits, or inconsistencies in skin texture, ensuring anatomical correctness.",
