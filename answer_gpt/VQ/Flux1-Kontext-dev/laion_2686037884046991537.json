    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and mouth drawn on the whoopie pie surfaces aligned with the curvature of the cookie and free from visible distortions or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible eyes or mouth drawn on the whoopie pie surfaces. The illustration maintains an exaggerated cartoon character style without specific facial features on the pies. The focus is on the creative representation of the whoopie pies as characters rather than on detailed facial expressions, aligning with cartoon depictions. Therefore, the question about the alignment of eyes and mouth is not applicable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chocolate cookie surface retain its original texture pattern (such as cracks and dimples) beneath the cartoon-style coloring, or is it completely smoothed out in an unnatural way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon-style coloring retains some of the original texture features like cracks on the chocolate cookie surface, which reflects a realistic touch despite the stylization. The artist has maintained the surface patterns to ensure the whoopie pies retain characteristics of real cookies, avoiding unnatural smoothing.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the limbs of the whoopie pie characters proportionally scaled to the cookie body and connected at logical points (e.g., sides or top), without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the whoopie pie characters have limbs that are scaled proportionally to the cookie body size and are connected logically to the character's form, e.g., the legs and arms are attached at appropriate points on the side, typical of cartoon representation. This indicates thoughtful design in terms of body structure and scale.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the spatula held by the leading whoopie pie character proportionally sized compared to the cookie body and oriented in a way that suggests natural grip and movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatula is depicted as a large utensil relative to the character, consistent with a cartoon-style exaggeration. The grip appears natural within the context of the scene, with the pie character's hand position suggesting dynamic preparation for movement combined with the cartoon theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the two whoopie pie characters peering over the edge of the plate positioned so that their lower halves remain below the plate’s edge, with no unnatural floating or cut-off limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration does not feature two characters peering over the plate's edge; instead, it portrays several whole whoopie pies arranged artistically on a plate. Thus, the question about positioning relative to the plate's edge is not applicable.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the text bubble containing “I heard today’s flavor is mint! Let’s find it!” placed adjacent to the speaking character without overlapping critical features like eyes or limbs, and is the handwritten font clear and unblurred?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text bubble is placed near the whoopie pie character in a manner that avoids overlapping or obstructing critical features of the pie itself. The font inside the bubble is clear and legible, maintaining the consistency of cartoon-style communication without blurring.",
