      "question": "Do the tessellated tiles forming the sausages maintain the original elongated, curved shape without geometric distortion or unnatural straightening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows sausages made up of square mosaic tiles on a patterned plate. Despite being converted to mosaic tiles, the sausages retain their elongated and slightly curved form, similar to that found in a traditional sausage. There is no evidence of geometric distortion or significant straightening that would alter their original shape. The aggregation of the tiles accurately contours to the sausages' natural form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the green-tiled areas shaped to mimic the natural ruffled edges and layered structure of lettuce leaves, with no uniform or blocky alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green-tiled areas in Image B are meant to represent lettuce leaves. Although the mosaic technique introduces some regularity, the tiles are placed deliberately to reflect the ruffled and diverse edges and layers characteristic of lettuce. There is no apparent uniform or overly blocky alignment that distorts the natural look of the leaves, as the irregular tile placement captures the complexity of the leaf structure.",

      "question": "Is the egg-shaped tile formation perfectly circular with a centrally placed orange-yellow yolk section, matching the original egg’s proportions and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The egg in Image B is represented by mosaic tiles arranged in a circular form, with an orange-yellow yolk section that appears centered. This mimicry aligns well with the original egg's proportions and placement. The tiles reflect the shape and orientation observed in the original without deviation, maintaining the intended likeness of an egg, particularly in the roundness of the yolk section.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mosaic elements positioned symmetrically around the plate’s center, with equal spacing and proportional sizing between the sausage, salad, and egg sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the mosaic elements representing the sausages, salad, and egg are well-organized, but they are not perfectly symmetrical in terms of their exact spatial arrangement around the plate's center. While the tile segments are generally proportionate, the spacing is not exactly equal among the sections, given the inherent irregularities of depicting organic forms with mosaic tiles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all glass tiles exhibit uniform edge definition, subtle reflection effects, and consistent color shading without visible artifacts like blurring or jagged lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mosaic tiles in Image B show a high level of craftsmanship, with defined edges and consistent color shading. There are noticeable subtle reflections, simulating glass tiles authentically. There is no blurring or jagged lines that disrupt the image's quality, indicating that the tiles maintain uniform edge definition and consistent color shading.",
