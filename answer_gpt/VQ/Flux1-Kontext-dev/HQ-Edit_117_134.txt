    "Question": "Q3: Is the color transition from black to caramel seamless, with soft gradients and natural light interaction that matches the lighting in the room?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a piano with a uniform caramel color; thus, there is no transition from black to caramel. As there is no black to caramel color gradient present to assess, the change itself is not applicable for evaluation.",
    "answer": "No"
