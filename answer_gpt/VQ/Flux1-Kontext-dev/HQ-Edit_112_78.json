      "question": "Does the glass container display natural transparency with visible embossed patterns that do not appear distorted or unnaturally stretched?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the glass container in Image B, the glass is ridged and most likely designed to resemble a teapot. The ridges are consistent and smooth, indicating that they are intended to be part of the design rather than being distorted. This consistency and the presence of regular embossed patterns without irregularities suggest that the glass container exhibits natural transparency and does not appear distorted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the candle snuffer finial proportionally aligned with the glass container and structurally connected without gaps or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the finial at the top is ornately crafted, fitting seamlessly into the design of the lid of the glass container, suggesting a proportional alignment. This finial is connected through visible seam lines; there are no visible gaps, floating elements, or misalignments where it would unnaturally float above the lid.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the marble base show consistent veining and reflective surface without any remnants of lace texture or unnatural seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the marble base features a unique pattern consistent with marble veining. It reflects light and has a smooth surface that complements the elegance of the scene. Furthermore, no lace texture or any seams are visible on this base, reaffirming its clean and natural appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the nameplate attached to the side of the container at a natural height and angle, with no floating or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nameplate marked 'Elegance Aroma' is integrated onto the side of the glass container in Image B. It aligns naturally with the curvature of the glass, showing no signs of floating or clipping, suggesting that the nameplate's position is intentional and polished in presentation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the reflections and shadows on the glass container, marble base, and finial align with the direction of the light source and exhibit consistent material behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals a consistent direction and behavior of light and shadow. Shadows cast on both the glass container and marble base in Image B maintain alignment with the diagonal light source, contributing to the cohesive material reflection behavior across the objects.",
