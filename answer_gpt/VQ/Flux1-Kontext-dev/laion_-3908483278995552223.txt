    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior maintain accurate limb proportions and body structure without distorted joints or exaggerated features?",
    "explanation": "The 3D model of the Aquatic warrior appears to maintain accurate body proportions. The limbs are well-defined and natural in appearance with no visible distortion. Common anatomical proportions such as limb length and joint positioning look correct based on typical human anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the metallic blue surfaces of the armor rendered with natural light reflections and depth, avoiding flat or uniform coloring?",
    "explanation": "The armor displays realistic depth and light reflections, showcasing a metallic luster that suggests dimensionality. Various shades of blue indicate how the light interacts naturally with the material, avoiding a flat appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the trident positioned correctly in the hand and scaled appropriately relative to the figure, without bending or truncation?",
    "explanation": "The trident is held naturally in the warrior's hand with fingers wrapped around it as one would expect when gripping an object. The size of the trident is proportionate to the figure and does not appear bent or truncated.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the dome enclosing the model have smooth curvature and consistent transparency without visible stitching, warping, or reflection anomalies?",
    "explanation": "The dome exhibits a smooth, even curvature and maintains consistent transparency. There are no indications of stitching, warping, or irregular reflections that would disrupt its appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the coral reef base textured with natural-looking organic patterns and scaled appropriately to support the model without appearing undersized or oversized?",
    "explanation": "The coral reef base presents natural organic textures and patterns that resemble real coral. The size is appropriate for supporting the model, complementing it without dominating the visual space.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the swirling ocean currents around the model follow continuous, directional flow paths without abrupt breaks or floating fragments?",
    "explanation": "The ocean currents encircle the model fluidly, following continuous paths that suggest motion. There are no abrupt interruptions or disjointed floating pieces that could interrupt the visual coherence of the currents.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the hand holding the trident have exactly five fingers with natural joint angles and grip pressure, without extra digits or unnatural bends?",
    "explanation": "The hand gripping the trident has five fingers, and the fingers are positioned naturally around the trident, mimicking a realistic grip. There are no extra digits or unnatural bends present.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are all elements (model, dome, base, currents) spatially aligned and layered correctly, with no floating or disconnected parts?",
    "explanation": "All elements, including the model, dome, base, and ocean currents, are spatially aligned with each other. There are no parts that appear to float separately or be disconnected from the rest of the scene, indicating a cohesive and well-integrated arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
