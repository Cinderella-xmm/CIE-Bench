    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the limbs of the astronaut proportionally consistent with human anatomy, and do they avoid unnatural bends or distortions in the joints when enlarged with zig-zag motion lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut illustration is examined for consistency with human anatomy. The limbs appear to maintain natural proportions, with no unnatural bends or distortions apparent in the joints. Although the illustration style is cartoonish, it retains a recognizable human form without incorporating zig-zag motion lines that might distort proportions.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the celestial motifs applied to the suit exhibit uniform texture and shading that aligns with the material appearance of the spacesuit, without visible seams or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Regarding the texture and shading of the spacesuit in Image B, the cartoon-styled illustration employs consistent colors and shading techniques that suggest a light source, aligning with the general look of a spacesuit. Due to the drawn style, there are no visible seams or artifacts that disrupt the visual continuity of the motifs against the suit.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the illustrated moon surface positioned at the correct depth and scale relative to the astronaut’s feet and shadow, with no visible gaps or misalignment between the figure and ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration shows the moon surface beneath the astronaut’s feet. The cartoonish design portrays the surface to scale with the rest of the depiction, having the astronaut's feet correctly grounded. The shadows and surface align correctly, not showing any visible gaps or misalignments.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the astronaut’s face retain natural facial proportions and feature alignment, such as symmetrical eyes and a defined jawline, without excessive smoothing or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The question focuses on facial proportions and natural alignment. However, the face in Image B is intentionally blurred, thus obscuring any detailed analysis of features such as symmetrical eyes or a defined jawline. Due to this blurring, assessment of proportionality and alignment cannot be accurately determined from the available visual information.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Not applicable due to blurring",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the space-themed border evenly aligned around the image edge without overlapping or cutting into the astronaut or background elements, and does the simulated card stock texture appear uniform and free of repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a border around the illustration. The border appears evenly aligned around the edges of the card-like format without overlapping the astronaut or background. The texture appears to simulate a card stock, maintaining uniformity without visible repetitive patterns.",
