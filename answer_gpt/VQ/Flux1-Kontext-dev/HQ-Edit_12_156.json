      "question": "Are the enchanted vines covering the Eiffel Tower's lattice continuous and aligned with its original structural lines, without jagged edges or inconsistent thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the enchanted vines are not strictly aligned with the original structural lines of the Eiffel Tower. The thickness of the vines appears inconsistent, with some areas having a more pronounced presence and others less so, contributing to a somewhat jagged appearance. This is not in line with the consistent and uniform presentation that would align closely with the tower's lines.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glowing floral motifs emit light uniformly and cast soft glows that match the ambient lighting from the sunset, without abrupt brightness spikes or disconnected highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing floral motifs appear to emit light relatively uniformly. The lighting from these motifs complements the ambient sunset light, enhancing the mystical theme of the image. There are no abrupt spikes in brightness or disconnected highlights noted, which suggests a harmonious blending with the overall scene lighting.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ancient stone platform at the base of the tower proportionally scaled to the tower's legs and positioned symmetrically, without visible warping or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stone platform in Image B appears to be proportionally scaled and symmetrically aligned with the base of the tower. There is no visible warping or misalignment, maintaining the integrity and balance with the tower's base structure, which supports a coherent and symmetrical design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the arcane symbols on the stone platform evenly spaced, properly oriented, and rendered with depth and shadowing that suggest they are carved into the stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the arcane symbols on the stone platform appear to be evenly spaced and oriented in a way that suggests intentional placement. The rendering with depth and the presence of shadowing contribute to the perception that these symbols are carved into the stone, providing a sense of authenticity and depth to the scene.",

      "question": "Do the swirling nebulae in the sky flow smoothly from the towerâ€™s base upward, blending with the orange gradient without sharp edges or disconnected patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The swirling nebulae in Image B appear to flow smoothly from the base of the tower upwards. They blend well with the orange sky gradient, and there are no sharp edges or disconnected patches noted. This seamless transition between elements contributes to a cohesive visual and thematic effect.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the crystal pinnacle at the top of the tower have distinct, reflective facets that catch the sunlight and show subtle refractions, without appearing blurry or geometrically distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal pinnacle is depicted with distinct and reflective facets that catch the sunlight effectively. There are clear indications of light refractions on the pinnacle, and it does not appear blurry or geometrically distorted. This detail adds an element of realism and enhances the magical atmosphere of the image.",
