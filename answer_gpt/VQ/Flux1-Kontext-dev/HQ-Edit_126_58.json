      "question": "Do the wing areas of the swan exhibit a consistent frosted glass texture that matches the lighting and translucency of the original ice material without visible seams or unnatural surface distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When assessing the transformation from a swan to a bottle, it's crucial to ensure the texture remains consistent. The original swan, featuring frosted glass texture, appears delicate and coherent, with lighting enhancing its translucent nature. In Image B, the transformed bottle must maintain this delicate texture without seams or surface distortions to appear natural and consistent with the original material. Although the swan has been replaced with a bottle, the image maintains coherence and continuity without visible seams or distortions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the neck of the swan transformed into a glass stopper with a smooth, tapered shape that maintains proportional alignment with the body and does not exhibit unnatural bending, jagged edges, or volume inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neck of the swan is transformed into a glass stopper. A smooth and tapered shape is required for the stopper to maintain proportional alignment with the bottle body. This transformation should avoid unnatural bending, jagged edges, or volume inconsistencies. The stopper's alignment with the body, as well as its smooth contours, need to be free from digital artifacts that could disrupt the image's coherency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red, pink, and green decorative elements (such as pine branches and flowers) integrated into the base of the bottle in a way that avoids floating or disconnected positioning, and do they maintain natural color and texture without blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decorative elements surrounding the base of the bottle in Image B should further the aesthetic without appearing detached or floating. Proper integration into the scene, maintaining natural color and texture, is essential. These elements need to be perceived as part of the display, avoiding blurring or pixelation which would disrupt the visual harmony. The elements in Image B appear integrated with a natural color and texture, without obvious issues of blurring or pixelation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the \"Winter Glow\" text clearly visible, properly aligned with the bottle's curvature, and does the iridescent effect appear smooth and continuous without unnatural color fringes or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The \"Winter Glow\" text on the bottle in Image B must be clearly visible and aligned with the bottle's curvature. The iridescent effect should be smooth and continuous to maintain visual consistency without digital artifacts. It should appear as a natural part of the bottle design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall shape of the transformed swan-bottle maintain structural coherence, with all parts proportionally aligned and without visible warping, stretching, or disjointed sections that break the continuity of the form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall shape of the bottle in Image B should maintain structural coherence akin to the original object in Image A, keeping proportional alignment without unwanted warping, stretching, or disjointed sections. Maintaining continuity ensures the image remains aesthetically pleasing and visually coherent.",
