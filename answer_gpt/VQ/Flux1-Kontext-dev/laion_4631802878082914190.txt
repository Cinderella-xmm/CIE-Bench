    "Question": "Q1: Are the animal characters positioned directly over the original locations of the process boxes without shifting or overlapping neighboring elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the animal characters are positioned near the process boxes representing their respective stages of the data journey, but they are not situated directly over the original locations of the processing boxes as in Image A. The characters are interacting with the environment, such as the fox with the magnifying glass or the one holding a stick near 'Business Understanding', implying a shift from strict placement related to Image A, where boxes were static and text-focused. This suggests a more dynamic arrangement but does suggest some displacement from the original layout.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the playful paths between characters form a continuous, unbroken winding route that follows the circular structure of the original diagram without abrupt turns or gaps?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pathways represented by the arrows do create a sense of motion and continuity between various stages, though they may lack the precise circular continuity of Image A's structured diagram. The paths wind through the scenery and connect the main points but aren't strictly circular or complete loops, displaying more playful interaction rather than a textbook-like diagram approach.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the central cluster of glowing data crystals positioned at the center of the diagram and scaled appropriately so it does not dominate or shrink the surrounding characters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing data crystals are positioned centrally but are strategically smaller to prevent them from dominating the composition. Instead, they act as focal points that enhance the visual narrative without overwhelming the characters or disrupting the spatial balance, which is reflective of narrative design rather than the strict centrality of the data tables in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the speech bubbles placed near each character without overlapping them or other elements, and do they contain legible text that is consistent in font and size?",
    "explanation": "Speech bubbles are not present in Image B; instead, each stage of the process is represented by placards positioned near the characters. The text within these placards is consistent in size and legible, clearly associated with the respective characters and process stages, reflecting a coherent and visually organized method of communication.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the animal characters display realistic limb positions and interactions with props (e.g., magnifying glass, laptop, clipboard) that conform to known anatomy and ergonomics?",
    "explanation": "The animal characters in Image B are anthropomorphized, interacting with props in a manner that reflects real-life ergonomics, such as the character holding the magnifying glass or the one interacting with a laptop. Although stylized, their positions and interactions are consistent with common anthropomorphized character designs where anatomic realism is modified for storytelling, yet remains plausible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all elements (characters, paths, background, text) rendered with consistent line art, shading, and color saturation, avoiding mismatched textures or sudden changes in style?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows consistent line art, shading, and color saturation across all elements. The stylistic choices are harmonious and uniform, providing a cohesive visual scene that avoids mismatched textures or abrupt style changes, offering a smooth and engaging viewing experience.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the title banner located at the top edge of the image, fully visible, and not overlapping any part of the diagram or characters?",
    "explanation": "The title banner in Image B is prominently placed at the top of the image, occupying a central position without overlapping any diagrammatic or character elements. It is fully visible and neatly separates the title as a distinct element from the rest of the narrative, consistent with common design practices for title placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
