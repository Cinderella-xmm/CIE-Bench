      "question": "Does the ornate armor on the character's torso and limbs have consistent geometric structure and natural surface textures without visible distortion or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ornate armor visible in Image B features a consistent geometric structure with surface textures that appear smooth and realistic. There are no visible distortions or broken edges, indicating a high-quality rendering likely intended to mimic historically inspired armor design. The metallic sheen and precise details contribute to a coherent and visually appealing appearance, aligning with common expectations of historical armor aesthetics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the gem-studded scepter proportionally accurate and physically plausible in size and shape relative to the character’s hand, with no distorted or misaligned gemstones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scepter held by the character appears to be proportionally accurate in relation to the character's hand. The size and shape of the scepter are plausible, and the gemstones embedded in the scepter are neither distorted nor misaligned. The arrangement of the gemstones maintains symmetry, which is consistent with typical ornamental scepter design.",

      "question": "Does the velvet cape exhibit natural draping behavior with realistic folds and shadows, and does it avoid unnatural intersections or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cape in Image B exhibits realistic folds and shadows that are consistent with how velvet material would naturally drape. The overall rendering avoids unnatural intersections and floating segments, giving the impression of a heavy and luxurious fabric draping properly over the character's form. This aligns with common knowledge of fabric physics and artistic rendering techniques.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the rolling hills and distant castle integrated smoothly into the scene with consistent lighting and shadow alignment, avoiding sharp edges or color discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background landscape in Image B, which includes rolling hills and a distant castle, integrates smoothly into the scene. The lighting and shadow alignment are consistent with the rest of the environment, showcasing a coherent artistic composition. There are no sharp edges or noticeable color discontinuities, suggesting a well-executed blend between foreground and background, which is essential for maintaining visual continuity in scenic illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character’s right hand holding the scepter show five correctly shaped fingers with natural joint alignment and skin texture, without deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s right hand, which is holding the scepter, shows five correctly shaped fingers. The fingers appear to be naturally aligned with proper joint articulation and realistic skin texture. There are no signs of deformation, extra digits, or anatomical inaccuracies. This observation is based on a clear visual depiction that respects anatomical accuracy common in high-quality character illustrations.",
