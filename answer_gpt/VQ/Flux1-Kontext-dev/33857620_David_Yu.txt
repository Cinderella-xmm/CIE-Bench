    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed roof retain its triangular silhouette with smooth, continuous edges and display detailed icy etchings that appear integrated into the surface rather than overlaid or fragmented?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the roof has been transformed into a dome-like structure with smooth, continuous edges, unlike its original triangular shape in Image A. The icy etchings are detailed and integrate seamlessly into the surface of the dome, rather than appearing as separate or fragmented elements. The etchings are well-integrated, providing a polished and cohesive appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the snow-covered areas transformed into wing-like forms that exhibit consistent translucency, subtle internal light diffusion, and seamless integration with the surrounding terrain without visible seams or unnatural brightness gradients?",
    "explanation": "The snow-covered areas, which originally appear on the mountains in Image A, have been transformed into wing-like forms in Image B. These wings show consistent translucency and a subtle light diffusion, with a glow that feels natural. They seamlessly blend with the terrain without visible seams or abrupt brightness gradients that would indicate an artificial modification.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Do the rocky outcrops in the foreground and midground form leg-like structures with anatomically plausible proportions, smooth transitions between segments, and moss textures that match the surrounding environment without appearing pasted or distorted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rocks in the foreground and midground are transformed into leg-like structures that fit into the newly created creature's body. The proportion of the legs appear anatomically plausible and transitions between segments are smooth. The moss textures blend well with the surrounding environment, not appearing as pasted elements or distorted compared to Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the stream display a uniform, low-intensity glow along its entire length that follows the natural flow path, without sudden bright spots, broken lines, or inconsistent illumination patterns?",
    "explanation": "The stream in Image B is depicted with a low-intensity glow that consistently follows the natural flow path. Unlike in Image A, where the stream is simply snowy water without special effects, Image B maintains uniform lighting across its length without abrupt bright spots, broken lines, or inconsistent brightness, enhancing the mystical aura of the setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the fog layer distributed evenly across the upper mountain regions and seamlessly blended with the sky and terrain, preserving depth cues and avoiding abrupt transitions or unnatural cloud formations?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fog layer appears evenly distributed across the upper mountain regions, maintaining depth cues without abrupt transitions or unnatural formations. The fog blends well with the sky and terrain, creating a coherent atmosphere that enhances the mysterious landscape, whereas in Image A, the fog serves a natural and subtle inclusion in the background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
