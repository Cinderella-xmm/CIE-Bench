      "question": "Does the replaced area where the mirror used to be show natural fabric canvas texture consistent with the wall art's minimalist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection area previously occupied by a mirror is now showing a landscape painting. The painting exhibits a smooth surface without visible texture. Typically, canvas textures feature a distinct weave pattern, but in this case, the surface seems too smooth to represent a natural fabric canvas. Therefore, based on observation and knowledge of canvas materials, the answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Is the minimalist landscape wall art placed at the same level as the original mirror's frame, ensuring no distortion or inconsistency in its placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landscape wall art is centered above the basin, maintaining a consistent alignment with the faucet. Compared to the original mirror's placement in Image A, the painting appears to be placed at approximately the same height and position. This alignment suggests intentional placement consistent with the original mirror, ensuring no distortion or inconsistency. The answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Does the minimalist landscape wall art maintain the room's structural coherence, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or disproportionate spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall art in Image B replaces the mirror but retains the rectangular shape that aligns with the existing tiles and the vanity unit. This alignment ensures that the room's structural lines and geometric shapes remain intact without any disproportionate spacing. The consistent alignment helps maintain visual coherence. Thus, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Are there any visible unnatural textures or artifacts on the fabric canvas material of the minimalist landscape wall art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The landscape art in Image B does not exhibit any irregular textures or noticeable artifacts. The surface appears smooth and consistent with an undisturbed digital painting. Typically, artifacts would present as inconsistencies or errors on the surface, which are not visible here. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the color scheme and style of the minimalist landscape wall art blend naturally with the bathroomâ€™s white marble tiles and wooden vanity, without looking out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The landscape in Image B primarily uses greens, blues, and earth tones that complement the wooden vanity and provide a contrast to the white marble wall tiles. The colors are muted and soft, aligning with the minimalist aesthetic of the space. The painting does not clash with the room's decor, maintaining cohesion in style and color palette. Thus, the answer is 'Yes'.",
