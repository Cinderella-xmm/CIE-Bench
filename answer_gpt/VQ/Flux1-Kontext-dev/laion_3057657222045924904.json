      "question": "Does the transparent acrylic display case show no visible distortion, reflection anomalies, or refraction errors that affect the appearance of the McLaren?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the acrylic display case appears smooth and clear, surrounding the McLaren without causing distortion to its appearance. The transparency of the case allows for clear visibility of the car without noticeable anomalies or errors. The lighting and reflections are handled well, as they do not interfere with the visual clarity of the car. Therefore, based on the visual appraisal, the acrylic case does not distort the appearance of the McLaren.",

      "question": "Is the polished chrome base aligned with the car's position and does it reflect light and surroundings naturally without appearing disconnected or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chrome base under the display case reflects the surroundings and light smoothly, providing a clean and coherent appearance in alignment with the McLaren. The base appears well-integrated with the display setup, rendering natural reflections without any signs of disconnection or distortion, thus supporting the visual consistency of the environment.",

      "question": "Are the carbon fiber textures confined to the interior walls of the display case and do they exhibit consistent, non-repeating patterns without visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior walls of the display case are decorated with carbon fiber textures that consistently cover the interiors. The pattern continuity and absence of artifacts or visual repetitions endorse the craftsmanship of the display case design, which enhances the overall presentation while maintaining a sleek aesthetic that's free from distracting errors or irregularities.",

      "question": "Are the miniature wrenches and screwdrivers proportionally accurate compared to the McLaren and positioned in a way that suggests intentional placement without floating or clipping through surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature tools like wrenches and screwdrivers are positioned along the backdrop, appearing proportionally small compared to the McLaren as would be expected for tools intended to accompany a small-scale or detailed display. They are seemingly suspended and positioned intentionally as part of the artistic arrangement within the display, without visual anomalies like clipping through surfaces, reflecting a thoughtfully curated presentation.",

      "question": "Is the laser-etched cityscape silhouette positioned at a consistent depth behind the car and display case, with no overlapping or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cityscape silhouette etched into the backdrop holds consistent depth relative to the display setting, contributing to the thematic context without causing any visual interference with the car or the showcase itself. The depth and positioning avoid any overlapping or clipping concerns, thereby adding depth and dimension to the visual presentation without disrupting the overall visual harmony of the display case scene.",
