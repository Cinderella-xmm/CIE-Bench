      "question": "Does the soccer ball retain its natural hexagonal pattern and smooth texture after being transformed into a halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball features a halftone style typical of pop-art, characterized by dotted patterns and bold coloration. The natural hexagonal pattern is still discernible, but the texture is modified to fit the pop-art aesthetic, which prioritizes vibrant and stylized visuals over realistic ones. Therefore, while the pattern is somewhat retained, the smooth texture is altered by the halftone effect.",

      "question": "Are the glittering effects on the goalpost converted into the halftone pop-art style without creating unnatural textures or losing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glittering effect on the goalpost is transformed into bright yellow starburst shapes typical of pop-art. While these emphasize the sparkling effect, they do not replicate the detailed sparkling seen in natural glitter. The halftone technique is applied, resulting in a stylized rather than a realistic representation, which compromises realistic detail.",

      "question": "Do the proportions of the soccer ball and the goalpost remain consistent and physically plausible after applying the halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the soccer ball and goalpost appear consistent with typical representations in art. The transformation into pop-art maintains the overall scale and relative proportions, ensuring they still appear physically plausible within the stylized depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the soccer ball and the netting of the goalpost preserved without distortion in the halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hexagonal pattern of the soccer ball and the grid pattern of the goalpost netting are clearly retained albeit in a stylized form. The geometric shapes are preserved, fitting the stylized halftone look without causing disfigurement or distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the soccer ball and goalpost maintain visual credibility without introducing obvious artifacts in the halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition and layout of Image B maintain visual credibility despite the transition to a halftone pop-art aesthetic. The positions and orientations of the elements – soccer ball and goalpost – resemble their arrangement in conventional settings, while the color scheme and texture are in line with pop-art norms without introducing noticeable artifacts.",
