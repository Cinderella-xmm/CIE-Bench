      "question": "Does the keychain with the chibi-style German Shepherd appear naturally integrated into the scene without disrupting the overall realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain features a chibi-style German Shepherd. Chibi-style elements often appear cartoonish and exaggerated. While the design successfully reflects a playful cartoon aesthetic, this inherently does not blend seamlessly into realistic contexts, especially when juxtaposed with a real hand. Therefore, its integration into a real-world scene will naturally disrupt realism.",

      "question": "Are the soft rubber texture and bold black outline of the keychain clearly visible and free from unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain shows a clear and consistent depiction of a soft rubber texture, typical in such merchandise. The bold black outline of the design is crisp and matches stylistically with common chibi and cartoon-like products. This indicates no unnatural artifacts present in the texture or outline.",

      "question": "Is the small silver keyring proportionate and logically attached to the keychain without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the keychain in Image B, the silver keyring appears appropriately sized for the scale of the keychain. It is attached at the correct point where keyrings usually attach, to the top of the cartoon figure, with no evident distortion. This suggests a logical design and attachment.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand in Image B is depicted holding the keychain with fingers wrapped around it in a manner that appears relaxed and natural. The anatomical structure of the fingers and thumb are correctly positioned to grip the object seamlessly without any visible distortion or awkwardness.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a consistent, neutral color without any visible alterations, patterns, or artifacts that would suggest unintended edits or distractions. This uniform simplicity ensures focus remains on the hand and keychain.",
