    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the patterned scales on the cactus body consistent in texture and color with the embroidery of the sombrero, and do they follow the natural curvature of the cactus without visible seams or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus body is adorned with intricate patterns that resemble scaled armor, echoing an embroidery style similar to the sombrero design. The patterns follow the natural curvature of the cactus seamlessly, without any visible seams or distortions, ensuring a consistent aesthetic theme with the sombrero. The smooth transition and homogeneity between the scales and the rest of the cactus body further enhance this integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the stone-like base beneath the cactus have a natural rock texture, proper grounding on the wooden surface, and proportional size relative to the cactus, without appearing detached or unnaturally shaped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cactus with a stone-like base that features realistic rock texture with visible cracks and natural grounding on the sandy surface. The proportionality with the cactus is well-maintained, contributing to a cohesive look where the base does not appear detached or unnaturally shaped, supporting the cactus's structure naturally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the golden quills emerge naturally from the cactus ridges in a uniform, radial pattern, maintaining the original spine density and orientation without clumping, floating, or intersecting improperly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden quills uniformly emerge from the cactus ridges, maintaining a radial and natural pattern typical of cactus spines. They are evenly distributed without unusual clumping or intersecting improperly. This arrangement ensures that the quills look integrated into the cactus structure and not artificially placed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sandy aura smoothly integrated around the base of the cactus and stone feet, exhibiting soft gradients and particle flow consistent with wind dynamics, without sharp boundaries or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandy aura in Image B is depicted as an ethereal glow around the cactus and its stone-like features. This effect is smooth, showing soft gradients that mimic natural wind dynamics. There are no sharp boundaries or pixelation, resulting in a fluid integration that enhances the mystical aspect of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the topaz-colored eyes placed symmetrically and naturally on the upper portion of the cactus, with clear reflections and highlights that match the ambient lighting, without distorting surrounding spines or surface geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the topaz-colored eyes are placed symmetrically on the cactus, featuring highlights and reflections that align with the prevailing lighting conditions. Their placement looks natural and without distortion to the surrounding spines or surface geometry, lending the cactus a lifelike yet fantastical appearance.",
