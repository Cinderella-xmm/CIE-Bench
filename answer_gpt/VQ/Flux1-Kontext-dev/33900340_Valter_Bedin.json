    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the archways in the tower appear as articulated limbs with natural joint-like transitions, preserving their original arch shape and avoiding unnatural bends or breaks in geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural features of the tower have been modified to resemble articulated limbs of a large golem-like figure. The archways form curved shapes that mimic joints and arms, suggesting a transformation from their rigid architectural form to a more flexible, limb-like structure. Despite this transformation, the arches maintain their general curvature without any unnatural bends or breaks. Thus, they appear as if they naturally transition into limbs, reflecting a design that retains the integrity of their original shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glowing glyphs evenly distributed across the stone surface, matching the texture of the original masonry and lacking jagged edges, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, glowing glyphs are seen on the golem's body, originating from the stone surface of the tower. These symbols are well-integrated into the structure, appearing smooth and evenly distributed across the masonry. There are no visible digital artifacts such as jagged edges, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts, which suggests that the glyphs match the texture and pattern of the original stone surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition from dark shadowed areas to the mystical aura around the structure gradual and continuous, without sharp discontinuities or floating light effects that lack grounding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mystical aura surrounding the structure in Image B shows a smooth and continuous transition from dark shadowed areas to illuminated parts. The lighting appears natural, with no sharp edges or abrupt changes in brightness. Floating light effects are grounded with the context of the scene, enhancing the mystical atmosphere without appearing unnatural or disconnected.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the luminous guide wisp occupy the same position as the original figure and dog, maintaining proportional scale and spatial alignment, while exhibiting a translucent, wispy texture without solid edges or anatomical features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminous guide wisp in Image B occupies the same position as the original figure and dog from Image A. It maintains a similar scale and alignment within the scene, ensuring correct spatial correspondence. The wisp is depicted with a translucent, ethereal quality and lacks solid edges or detailed features, embodying a mystical presence consistent with its intended representation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the foreground, midground, and background elements still perceptually layered with correct depth relationships, so that the golem appears to stand within the space rather than floating above or behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three-dimensional spatial arrangement ensures that the golem is perceived to stand firmly within the architectural space. The foreground, midground, and background are clearly distinguished, maintaining proper depth relationships. The golem is positioned in a way that respects these layers, giving it a tangible presence within the scene rather than appearing detached or out of place.",
