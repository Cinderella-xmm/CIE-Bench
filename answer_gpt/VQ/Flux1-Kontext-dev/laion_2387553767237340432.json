      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the marbled ceramic finish on both vases display consistent, smooth patterns without visible texture breaks or artificial repetitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the marbled ceramic finish on the vases can be seen as having smooth, consistent patterns. These patterns appear natural, without abrupt breaks or repetitions, suggesting an even application of the marbling effect. This consistency is typically achieved through careful crafting or digital rendering techniques that avoid texture irregularities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the branding decals applied to the vases clearly visible, proportionally sized, and aligned with the surface curvature without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branding decals on the vases in Image B are visibly clear and appropriately sized to fit the surface of the vases. They are aligned with the curvature, maintaining their proportionality without visible distortion, indicating careful placement and graphic technique consistent with branding designs on curved surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the gold leaf accents on the vases show realistic highlights and edge definition consistent with metallic foil applied to curved surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold leaf accents on the vases exhibit realistic highlights and edge definition that give the appearance of metallic foil. The lighting and reflections seem accurate for a curved surface, suggesting a careful digital representation of how metallic elements interact with light.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cross-sectional illustration on the packaging box accurately depicting the internal petal arrangement of the vases without geometric mismatch or incorrect layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the packaging box with a cross-sectional illustration that matches the arrangement of the petals on the vases. The illustration seems consistent with the geometric layering, showing proper alignment and no visible mismatch, which indicates accuracy in graphic representation of three-dimensional objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bronze typography on the packaging box legible, evenly spaced, and free from blurring or unwanted shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bronze typography on the packaging in Image B appears legible and evenly spaced. There is clear definition without blurring or unwanted shadows, which is typically ensured in professional packaging design by using high-resolution printing or digital techniques for clarity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the two vases still symmetrical and proportionally accurate compared to the original, with no stretched or compressed sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the edited vases maintain their symmetrical design and proportional accuracy. This indicates that no distortion such as stretching or compressing has occurred in the edit, preserving the original form and structure of the vases which are crucial for both aesthetic and functional purposes.",
