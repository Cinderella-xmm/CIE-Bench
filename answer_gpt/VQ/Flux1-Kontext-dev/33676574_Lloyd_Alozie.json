    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the tallest tower on the left retain its original vertical structure and proportional height after being modified with robotic limb features, without any visible stretching, compression, or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tallest tower on the left is transformed into a robotic figure with limb-like structures. By analyzing its appearance, including the smoothness of the transitions and presence of edges, it seems that the original shape has been altered considerably. The tower now serves as the backdrop, and the previous smooth vertical structure is integrated into the design of a mech-like character, indicating significant modifications. Given these observations, it's evident that the original structure has been transformed, showing a change in proportions and design, rather than retention without stretching or compression issues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the neon circuitry patterns on the EMAAR building and nearby towers smoothly integrated into the facade without visible line breaks, uneven spacing, or unnatural color gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the EMAAR building and nearby towers display neon patterns that seem to flow uniformly across the buildings. Examining the line work, there appears to be continuity in the spacing and progression of patterns, ensuring they fit naturally over the surface without abrupt breaks or discrepancies in their design. The coloring appears intentional and consistent, suggesting the patterns are well executed without visible editing artifacts that could disrupt their uniformity.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the scale-like panels on the dark glass towers exhibit uniform texture and reflection behavior, with no repeating patterns or distorted shapes suggesting low-quality rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When observing the towers in Image B, there are areas where textures seem uniform, and reflections are consistent with the smooth glass facade behaviors. However, upon closer inspection, distinct scale-like panels or visible distortion issues aren't present, considering the creative theme and focus on neon embellishments instead. The lack of such panels implies the attention may not have been on showcasing scale-like structures, thus rendering the concept of uniformity or distortion less applicable.",

      "question": "Do the glowing expressway spines maintain realistic width and curvature throughout their length, connecting logically to surrounding roads and showing no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features glowing expressways that curve dynamically through the frame. The lines showcase consistent width, suggesting realistic path renderings consistent with road concepts, with curvature appearing smooth and continuous. They seem logically integrated into the foreground environment without noticeable segments where disconnection or inconsistency occurs, maintaining a cohesive design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fin-like structures added to the tops of the buildings properly aligned with the rooflines and scaled appropriately, without appearing detached or structurally unstable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several structures atop buildings resemble fins, blending seamlessly with new configurations and maintaining structural coherence. The alignment is apparent with the rooflines, providing support for stability suggestions, in line with patterns frequently seen in futuristic architecture designs. There is no evident detachment or misalignment, which would undermine their integration.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the holographic eye-like elements located on top of major towers clearly defined with smooth light emission and no visible digital artifacts such as aliasing or double images?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes glowing elements that resemble holographic eyes. These are well-defined with clear light emissions mimicking sophisticated digital rendering. Upon analysis, no obvious artifacts like aliasing or ghost images are discernible, suggesting high-quality execution in their integration, thus affirming a smooth visual result.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all illuminated windows, signs, and architectural details (e.g., on the EMAAR building and VOCO tower) sharp and legible, with no visible blurring or degradation from the editing process?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buildings in Image B retain sharply executed illuminated elements. Windows and signs are visibly detailed, maintaining legibility despite transformations for futuristic tones in editing. The visual execution keeps clarity, ensuring that no significant blurring or loss in texture quality, which could denote degradation from editing, is observed.",
