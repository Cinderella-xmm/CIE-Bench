    "Question": "Q1: Are the bold primary colors applied to the train's body consistent across all surfaces without visible color bleeding or mismatched tones?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the train primarily uses bold primary colors with strong contrast against each other, characteristic of pop art style. These colors are applied without visible bleeding or tonal mismatches. Each section of the train maintains solid color consistency, and the sharp, contrasting colors typical in pop art suggest a controlled and even application. Therefore, the bold primary colors are consistent across the train's surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the halftone dot patterns on the train display consistent size, spacing, and alignment across all visible panels without distortion or clustering?",
    "explanation": "Halftone dot patterns in the edited image are evenly distributed and maintain a consistent size, spacing, and alignment, typical of the mechanical precision in creating pop art. Since no distortion or clustering is observed in the train's visible panels, the halftone dot patterns hold uniformity across the train.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the geometric shapes used to replace the barn’s wood texture aligned with the original architectural elements such as windows, doors, and roofline without breaking their structural boundaries?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the barn retains its structural form with clean, graphic lines outlining its architectural elements like windows, doors, and roofline. The geometric shapes effectively mimic these features without breaking their boundaries. The careful alignment showcases a substitute for wood texture while preserving the building's integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the graphic bursts representing foliage positioned in a way that respects the original spatial layout, with no overlapping or misplaced elements that contradict the scene’s depth?",
    "explanation": "The edited image maintains a spatially coherent placement of graphic bursts, representing foliage similar to the original image's layout while adhering to pop art aesthetics. These bursts complement the depth and do not overlap or shift significantly out of place, thus respecting the scene's original depth and layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the black outlines around the train, barn, and foliage uniformly sharp, continuous, and free from gaps or misalignments at object edges?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the stylistic use of black outlines around objects such as the train, barn, and foliage is characteristic of pop art. The outlines appear sharp, continuous, and well-defined, adhering closely to object edges without gaps or noticeable misalignments, which ensures a clear and cohesive pop art representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
