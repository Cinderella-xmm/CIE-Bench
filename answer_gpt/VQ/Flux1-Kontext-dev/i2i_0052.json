      "question": "Do the chibi-fied players maintain a natural appearance without introducing unnatural textures or artefacts that disrupt the scene's overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are designed in a chibi style, which inherently involves simplified and exaggerated features. This artistic style is intended to be cute and whimsical, rather than realistic. The texture and details are consistent with typical chibi designs, which means there are no unusual artefacts or textures disrupting their appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the outfits and hairstyles of the chibi-fied players proportionally and physically rational, avoiding any distortion that conflicts with the natural appearance of the players?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi style involves proportionally exaggerated features, such as larger heads and smaller bodies, which is typical and expected for this artistic choice. The outfits and hairstyles follow the conventions of this style and do not show any distortion beyond what is normally seen in chibi illustrations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the act of the chibi-fied players holding tennis rackets and shaking hands seem structurally consistent and free from deformation, fitting naturally into the pastoral setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-fied players are shown holding tennis rackets and shaking hands, which is structurally consistent within the context of the chibi art style. However, this scenario is placed within a pastoral setting, which is nonsensical as the setting itself does not accommodate a tennis context or activity. Therefore, the scene does not fit naturally within this environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the semi-transparent court logo in the background appear naturally integrated and does not introduce any visual distractions or distortions that detract from the scene’s authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The semi-transparent court logo is placed behind the chibi characters. This addition is stylistically consistent with adding a thematic element, yet it stands out against the pastoral background, which does not typically contain such elements. This leads to visual inconsistency with the natural background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the inclusion of chibi-fied players with tennis rackets and the court logo maintain the image's compositional balance and visual plausibility, without disrupting the natural arrangement of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-fied players and court logo incorporate elements from a tennis match into a pastoral setting. While the elements are visually consistent with each other, they clash with the original natural landscape, leading to a disruption in the scene’s natural arrangement.",
