    "Question": "Q1: Does the added kneeling figure have five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no distorted joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the added kneeling figure appears in the upper right corner. From the visual analysis, this figure's hands are clenched into fists, which suggests an accurate representation of five fingers in a natural, clenched position. There are no visible distortions or unnatural alignments in the joints, indicating natural hand shapes despite the angle not showing each finger distinctly. The outline and depiction match the typical cartoon style, aligned with the rest of the images.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the legs and torso of the leaping figure properly extended and aligned to reflect forward momentum without broken or warped limbs?",
    "explanation": "The leaping figure in Image B is centrally positioned, with its legs and torso exhibiting a dynamic leap. In cartoon illustrations like these, exaggerated, yet anatomically coherent, poses reflect momentum. The limbs of the figure appear properly extended, with the blue jumpsuit helping to emphasize a forward motion. The joints are bent naturally according to the action posture, and there is no indication of warped or broken limbs, maintaining the conveyed movement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the knees tucked tightly toward the chest with natural curvature and no visible deformation in the leg muscles?",
    "explanation": "Centering on Image B, the depicted action shows the figure's knees bent close towards the chest, as typical in a jump with arms raised. The curvature of the legs appears natural, matching the anticipated muscle tension during such an athletic move. The design does not depict any unnatural bulging or flattening of leg muscles, indicating no deformations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the bold outlines follow the contours of the figure smoothly without jagged edges or color spillage into adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bold outlines around the figure are integral in maintaining the character's clear shape. The outlines exhibit consistent thickness and smoothness, following the contours of the character without any noticeable pixelation or jaggedness. This smooth design helps to maintain the aesthetic quality across the image. There is no observed color spillage beyond these outlines into adjacent areas, ensuring a neat presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the text captions and step numbers positioned so they do not cover key facial features or limbs of the main figure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text and step numbers are organized around the figure illustrations. They are strategically placed to provide instructions without interfering with the main visual elements, such as key body parts or facial expressions of the figure. This positioning enhances both the readability of the text and the visibility of the characterâ€™s actions, ensuring neither is compromised.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the simplified figures in each step scaled consistently with the original character and aligned in perspective?",
    "explanation": "Each step in Image B illustrates a simplified figure showing different phases of the jump. The scaling of these figures is consistent with the original character size, maintaining the relative proportions and ensuring a coherent perspective across the steps. This uniformity supports the continuity and instructional purpose of the illustration, aligning each simplified character with the full depiction of the leap sequence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
