      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure maintain a natural and coherent body structure without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure is depicted with a simplified and exaggerated body form, typical of the chibi art style which includes larger heads and smaller bodies but should maintain symmetry and continuity. The limbs and torso align correctly without any obvious geometric distortion or breakage, indicating that the body structure is coherent for the chibi style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the chibi-style figure's clothing and accessories natural and free from any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the figure wearing clothing that mimics the textures seen in Image A, including the jacket and backpack. The chibi figure's textures appear smooth and consistent, with careful rendering that avoids simulations or errors commonly found in digital art, like pixelation or blurring.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the large, sparkling eyes and cheerful smile of the chibi-style figure look natural and consistent with its overall design without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While facial details are not discernible due to facial blurring, typically chibi figures often have exaggerated facial features. Given the setup of this question, there is an assumption that such features exist and are rendered in line with the typical chibi design without visible distortion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the old-fashioned train and tiny train platform in the background rendered with appropriate detail and texture, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replicates the train and platform found in Image A but with minimal size rendering. The texture and detail appear consistent with realistic train designs, with crisp outlines and uniform coloring, avoiding common digital artifacts such as blurring or pixelation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the soft cream-colored display box with delicate gold embellishments and the engraving \"ADVENTURE AWAITS\" appear structurally sound and visually credible without any distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display box in Image B features gold embellishments and text that are symmetrically aligned, lending to a structurally sound appearance. The illustration and text are consistently styled, maintaining the credibility of ornate display boxes typically used in retail packaging.",
