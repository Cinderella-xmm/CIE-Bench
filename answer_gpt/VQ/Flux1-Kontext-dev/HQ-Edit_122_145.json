      "question": "Are the limbs of the chibi character straight and properly connected at joints, with no visible kinks or disproportionate lengths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character's limbs appear to have a natural and balanced proportion. The arms and legs are depicted in a simplified, cartoony style typical for chibi illustrations, which often feature rounded and exaggerated features. However, within this style, the limbs are straight and appear correctly attached to the body at the joints. Therefore, there are no visible kinks or disproportionate lengths typical of errors.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character's face in Image B features large, symmetrical eyes typical of this artistic style.

      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the kimono clearly visible with sharp edges and no color smudging or pixelation, even after color enhancement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns on the kimono in Image B are clearly visible, with distinct and sharp edges. The colors are vibrant and well-defined, typical of a cartoonish chibi style, with no visible color smudging or pixelation. The quality of the art suggests that even after color enhancement, the details have been preserved well.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the cherry blossom branch is seen in a simplified cartoon style. The fingers are minimalistic and, while not detailed individually, the overall shape of the hand seems proportional and free of any deformities or extra digits.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the falling petals in the dancing pose follow a downward arc consistent with gravity, and are they evenly distributed without clustering or floating above the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The falling petals around the chibi characters in Image B are artistically arranged to appear as if they are gently floating down, consistent with the effects of gravity in their arc. They do not seem to cluster unnaturally or float too high above the character but rather maintain a balanced distribution around the figure, enhancing the dynamic feeling.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pastel background in Image B serves as a backdrop for the chibi characters. It appears to be uniformly colored, without visible texture artifacts, stripes, or unintended color shifts. The use of soft colors is consistent across the entire image, suggesting a deliberate uniformity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all four chibi figures are clearly visible and do not overlap with one another. They are evenly spaced across the sheet. There is no evidence of any figure being cut off at the edges, ensuring that each character is distinct and complete within the frame.",
