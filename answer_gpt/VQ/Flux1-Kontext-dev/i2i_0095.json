      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the style and glow effect of the word 'Shine' consistent with the aesthetic of the bathroom and does not look out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror has modern aesthetics with LED backlighting, consistent with contemporary bathroom designs. The word 'Shine' has a glowing effect that matches the mirror's lit borders, creating a harmonious visual theme.

      "question": "Does the addition of the word 'Shine' maintain the mirror's original shape and proportions, avoiding any geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual inspection of Image B, the addition of 'Shine' does not alter the geometric dimensions or proportions of the mirror. The shape remains a rectangle, and the alignment of the word is centered within this frame, maintaining symmetry and original proportions. No distortions are evident that would indicate a disruption in the mirror's geometry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the reflective properties of the mirror undisturbed by the addition of 'Shine', preserving the clarity and detail of the mirrorâ€™s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Shine' is added in a way that appears to be an overlay or digital effect on top of the mirror. However, the background reflection and the appearance of the mirror's surface do not show any blurring or loss of detail due to the word's presence. The mirror's function and clarity seem preserved as the word 'Shine' becomes part of the aesthetic rather than an intrusive element.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the positioning, size, and lighting of the word 'Shine' seem authentic, enhancing rather than detracting from the visual credibility of the bathroom setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the word 'Shine' is appropriately sized and positioned in the center of the mirror. The lighting effect complements the mirror's LED border, appearing like an intentional part of the design. The harmonious integration adds to the modern and stylish setting of the bathroom, thus enhancing its visual authenticity.",
