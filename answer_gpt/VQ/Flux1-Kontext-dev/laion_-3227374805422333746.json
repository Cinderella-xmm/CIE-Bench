    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the wooden planks on the walls seamlessly integrated with no visible gaps, misalignment, or unnatural texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden planks in Image B appear to be evenly placed across the house with a consistent width, giving the appearance of uniform construction. There are no visible gaps between the planks, nor is there any misalignment that disrupts the structural consistency. The texture of the planks is consistent and does not show unnatural repetition, contributing to a realistic wooden facade.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss texture cover only appropriate surfaces (e.g., lower stone blocks, corners) and appear layered and organic without floating or flat patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moss texture covers surfaces that naturally would acquire moss over time, like the lower parts of stone structures and corners where moisture might accumulate. The moss texture appears to have depth and an organic pattern, avoiding a flat or unrealistic appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the roof tiles, walls, and wooden elements uniformly adjusted to earthy tones without inconsistent color gradients or localized discoloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The roof tiles in Image B are uniformly red, matching typical earthy tones. The walls and wooden elements maintain a consistent hue, contributing to the optimization of a harmonious color palette. There are no visible gradients or discoloration across different parts of the structure, which affirms uniform color quality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature characters correctly scaled relative to the house and positioned in plausible locations (e.g., near doors, paths) without floating or intersecting with structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B are depicted at a scale that aligns with the size of the house, suggesting appropriate proportions for miniature figures in such a setting. They are positioned on flat surfaces like paths or grassy platforms and do not appear to float or intersect unnaturally with any architectural elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the parchment board positioned flat on the ground with realistic folds, texture, and shadow alignment matching the light source direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parchment board in Image B rests flat on the ground. It has realistic folds, which enhance its believability as a document laid on a platform. The shadow is cast in a direction that matches the light source, providing a coherent visual for depth and realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the rule booklets have consistent page thickness, visible spine details, and shadows that align with the lighting and surface they rest on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rule booklets in Image B are detailed with visible spines and pages of consistent thickness, suggesting high attention to illustrative realism. The shadows they cast align well with the overall direction of light, further confirming their integration onto the platform without visual inconsistency.",
