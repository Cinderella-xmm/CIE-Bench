      "question": "Are the pyramidâ€™s steps transformed into armored segments with consistent thickness, alignment, and geometric integrity, without visible breaks or unnatural warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the appearance of the pyramid has been transformed into a figure with a pyramidal shape at the top and a humanoid form below. The 'steps' of the pyramid are represented by the armored structure of the figure. These segments appear consistent in thickness and alignment, resembling armor plating, and maintain geometric integrity throughout the figure without visible breaks or unnatural warping. This indicates a deliberate and coherent transformation of the pyramid's structure into an armored form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the entrance at the top of the pyramid replaced with an eye-like structure that matches the stone material and scale, without abrupt texture changes or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the central part of the humanoid figure has a circular, glowing element that resembles an eye-like structure in its torso area, rather than at the top where the pyramid's entrance would originally be on Image A. This glowing feature integrates with the surrounding stone-like texture seamlessly and matches with the armored aesthetic of the figure, without abrupt texture changes or the presence of floating elements. However, since this structure is not at the top, the direct replacement for the entrance isn't visually evident.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trees and foliage surrounding the pyramid transform into vine-like scales that follow natural growth patterns and maintain consistent texture and lighting, without unnatural sharp edges or disconnected patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is covered with what resemble vine-like scales, which give a natural and organic appearance similar to foliage. These elements appear to follow natural patterns and are integrated into the form of the armor, maintaining consistent texture and lighting across the surface. There are no visible unnatural sharp edges or disconnected patches, suggesting a smooth transformation from trees to these vine-like scales.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are ancient stone patterns preserved and integrated into the base of the pyramid-creature, maintaining continuity with original carvings and avoiding mismatched or floating decorative elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the figure exhibits intricate stone patterns, likely reminiscent of ancient carvings. These patterns appear to be well-integrated into the humanoid structure and do not show signs of mismatched placements or floating decorative elements. The patterns enhance the creature's designed aesthetic without breaking from the original stone texture seen on pyramid structures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the luminescent plants around the base emit soft, localized light that interacts realistically with the environment, without overexposed areas or unnatural color spillage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, surrounding plants exhibit a luminescent quality, emitting a soft, localized glow. This light appears to interact naturally with the immediate environment, casting gentle illumination around the area without causing overexposure or unnatural color spillage. The lighting is controlled, suggesting a realistic integration of luminescent features within the scene.",
