      "question": "Does the central green block retain its original geometric shape after being converted into a 3D chibi-style cartoon character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central green block has been transformed from its original simple geometric shape into a 3D chibi-style cartoon character. The distinctive characteristics of chibi style include exaggerated features and a more rounded, less geometric aesthetic. Despite being animated, the green block in Image B retains its recognizably angular form with the additional round stubs on top, indicating its preservation of the original geometric shape in a stylized manner.",

      "question": "Are the red blocks redesigned as lively supporting characters free from unnatural textures and maintain their original structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red blocks have been anthropomorphized into lively chibi-style characters with human-like faces and rounded arms, diverging from their original simple block structure seen in Image A. This transformation introduces animated features, which do not entirely maintain the original structural integrity, as the redesign is meant to give them a sense of liveliness rather than preserving their block-like rigidity.",

      "question": "Does the transformed background with soft pastel colors blend naturally with the foreground elements without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a new background in soft pastel colors, creating a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing setting for the cartoon-like elements. This choice helps the foreground elements stand out, but also complements them. The background transition appears seamless, without any distracting artifacts, thus ensuring a natural blend with the foreground's bright colors.",

      "question": "Are the heart-shaped confetti elements evenly distributed and visually plausible without causing any loss of detail in the surrounding blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The heart-shaped confetti in Image B is dispersed around the chibi-style characters in a manner that complements the overall design of the image. These elements are evenly distributed and do not cover or obscure any significant details of the surrounding figures, maintaining a clear view of the principal characters. The confetti adds to the playful atmosphere without distracting from or diminishing the detail of the chibi characters.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the red blocks and the central green block maintain a consistent chibi aesthetic without any noticeable inconsistencies in style or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the red characters and the green block exhibit a coherent chibi aesthetic, characterized by smooth, simplistic curves and bright colors typical of this style. They share a consistent texture and design that aligns perfectly with the chibi style, indicating a thoughtful transformation from their original blocky form in Image A to a more animated, cartoon-like style.",
