      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of all four figures covered in soft-looking fabric with consistent, non-repeating bold patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow, and do they lack visible seams, pixelation, or artificial textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of each figure are covered in what appears to be vibrant, multi-colored patterns that include various shades of blue, green, red, and yellow. The patterns are bold and consistent across the figures, showing a non-random and aesthetically arranged design. There are no visible seams or pixelation that disrupt the appearance of the pattern, suggesting an integrated design where the texture doesn't exhibit artificiality. Based on these observations, the visual cues suggest that the figures have fabric-like appearances, which maintain uniformity in patterning and quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the legs and arms of all four figures morph into exaggerated fins and tails in a way that maintains their original dynamic poses without broken geometry or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures' legs and arms do not transform into exaggerated fins and tails. Instead, the limbs maintain a humanoid form with no visible change in their structure into aquatic features. The poses remain dynamic similar to what is expected from warrior figures, and there are no apparent signs of broken geometry or unnatural bends. Therefore, the limbs do not morph into any exaggerated aquatic features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the weapons of each figure been reimagined as integrated fish-like features (such as fins or tail extensions) without floating or misaligned components that break physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The weapons in Image B retain their original forms as axes and swords, without morphing into fish-like features. The weapons are held or attached to the figures logically, maintaining alignment that complements the pose and supports physical interaction. There is no evidence of them being transformed into underwater creatures or extensions like fins or tails, thus they remain as typical medieval or fantasy-style armaments.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a textured sandy fabric surface with subtle shading and depth, and are all four figures positioned naturally on it without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a textured sandy fabric surface with shading that suggests depth. The figures are positioned directly on this background in a way that implies grounding, without any signs of floating or clipping issues that would disrupt the spatial illusion. There is subtle lighting or shading that impacts the perception of depth, enhancing the realism of positioning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands of each figure retain a natural number of fingers (no more than five), maintain ergonomic grip positions, and show no signs of deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of each figure show a realistic depiction of fingers, exhibiting a natural count of no more than five digits. Their grip positions are well-aligned with the weapons they hold, reflecting anatomical accuracy and ergonomic logic. There are no signs of deformation or any additional digits that would suggest irregularities, confirming a natural representation.",
