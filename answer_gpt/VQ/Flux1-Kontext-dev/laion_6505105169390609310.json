      "question": "Are the three figurines positioned inside a transparent spherical enclosure with no visible warping or geometric distortion of their shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurines are positioned inside a transparent spherical enclosure, a typical design for a snow globe, allowing for a clear view without the distortion of shapes commonly caused by such enclosures. Upon close examination, the figurines retain their geometric integrity, and their shapes appear consistent and undistorted, suggesting the presence of a well-crafted globe. This indicates no significant warping or geometric distortion.",
