      "question": "Are the brushstroke effects and color transitions throughout the image smooth and consistent, without visible jagged edges or unnatural smudging in the fur, grass, or sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur, grass, and sky show smooth brushstroke effects consistent with a stylized watercolor design. The visual elements lack any jagged edges or unnatural smudging, maintaining a harmonious and cohesive appearance. The squirrels' fur transitions evenly from pink to yellow, and the sky has a soft gradient typical of watercolor art. This visual inspection and understanding of watercolor techniques confirm a smooth and consistent effect.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the light pink and pale yellow accents on the squirrel’s fur blend seamlessly with the surrounding gray and orange fur, maintaining natural texture and avoiding isolated patches or overly bright spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the squirrel with light pink and pale yellow accents that blend seamlessly with its grayish-orange fur. The integration of colors is smooth and uniform, avoiding any isolated patches or overly bright spots. The transition between colors maintains the fluffy texture of fur, consistent with the image's artistic style and avoiding jarring visuals.",

      "question": "Are the wings attached to the squirrel’s back in a position that follows natural shoulder anatomy, with appropriate size and curvature, and do they show consistent shading and transparency matching the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are positioned naturally on the squirrel's back, aligning with anatomical expectations for shoulder placement. They have an appropriate size and curvature, and consistent shading adds depth while transparency blends them with surrounding elements. This arrangement supports the watercolor style and portrays them as part of the scene without disrupting anatomical consistency.",

      "question": "Do the jewels replacing the acorns have defined facets and reflective surfaces that respond realistically to light, casting appropriate shadows on the grass, and are they sized consistently with the squirrel’s hand and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jewels replacing acorns have defined facets and show reflective surfaces that interact realistically with light. Shadows cast on the grass are appropriate for their orientation and environmental light sources. The jewels maintain a size proportionate to the squirrel's hand and mouth, ensuring coherence with expected handling and interaction sizes between the squirrel and jewels.",

      "question": "Is the blurred background a gradual transition from the foreground grass to a soft-focus forest, with no abrupt edges or repeated patterns that suggest artificial blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a blurred background with a gradual transition from sharply detailed foreground grass to a softly focused forest. There are no abrupt edges or repeated patterns, suggesting a natural visual depth typical of professional artistic style. The smoothness ensures that focus shifts gently across the scene, reinforcing the image's cohesive watercolor appearance.",
