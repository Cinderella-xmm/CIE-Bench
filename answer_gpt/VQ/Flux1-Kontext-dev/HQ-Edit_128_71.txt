    "Question": "Q1: Does the scaled-down Statue of Liberty retain correct proportions between its head, torso, arms, and legs without any visible stretching or compression?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the Statue of Liberty inside a glass lantern, scaled down in this context. The visual cues show that the statue's proportions between its head, torso, arms, and legs appear consistent and well-maintained, as the scaled-down version retains its iconic form without any distortion. Despite being miniature, the proportionality is consistent with the original structure, commonly seen in replicas of such famous monuments.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the green and copper hues on the statue’s surface distributed naturally with variations in tone and texture resembling real patina formation?",
    "explanation": "The Statue of Liberty is known for its distinctive green patina formed over long periods. In Image B, the hues and textures on the statue mimic this natural patina well, showing varied tones of green and copper that closely resemble real patina formation. This variation in colors corroborates what is typically expected with the oxidation process of copper.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the glass lantern transparent with visible reflections and refractions, and do its edges appear smooth without jagged lines or digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass lantern exhibits characteristics of transparency with visible reflections and refractions, indicative of real glass. The edges of the lantern appear smooth, lacking any jagged lines or digital artifacts. These visual elements suggest a clear and clean representation of a glass surface, expected in high-quality digital images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the pastel skyline composed of smooth color gradients and softly defined building silhouettes without abrupt color changes or banding?",
    "explanation": "While Image B centers on the Statue of Liberty in a glass container and does not specifically focus on a skyline or building silhouettes, the background color in the jar's scene has smooth gradients echoing the sky, ensuring color transitions appear natural without abrupt changes or banding, thus maintaining a soft aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the ships and waves beneath the statue appropriately sized relative to the statue and do they exhibit natural shapes and wave patterns without repetition or distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ships and waves beneath the statue are scaled down proportionally, consistent with the miniature display within the lantern. Their sizes relative to the statue make sense given the reduced scale; they appear to have natural shapes and patterns, avoiding noticeable repetition or distortion that would diminish realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the revolving mechanism at the base integrated seamlessly with the lantern’s structure, with all components properly aligned and grounded without floating or misaligned parts?",
    "explanation": "The base of the glass lantern is depicted as a solid object in Image B, with components integrated well into the overall structure. The alignment appears correct, ensuring the statue and base have a coherent connection. No floating or misaligned elements are visible, suggesting a seamless design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do all elements in the scene—including the statue, glass lantern, ships, and waves—cast shadows consistent with a single light source and show uniform lighting without conflicting highlights or dark spots?",
    "explanation": "Image B reflects a consistent lighting scenario where the elements within the glass lantern are illuminated uniformly. The depiction avoids conflicting lighting changes, with highlights and shadows appearing consistent across the statue, lantern, ships, and waves, indicative of a single, coherent light source.",
    "answer": "Yes"
