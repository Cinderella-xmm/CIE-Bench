      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the diced vegetables maintain their structural coherence and visual credibility after being transformed into a Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diced vegetables are rendered in a Cubist style, featuring abstract and stylized forms. The geometric shapes are still recognizable as diced vegetables, maintaining a form of structural coherence despite the artistic interpretation. The Cubist style utilizes angular shapes and fragmented forms, which may not be typical of real vegetable dices, but they are visually credible within the context of this art style. Compared to Image A, where the vegetables have precise and natural cube shapes, Image B presents them with exaggerated edges and variations consistent with Cubist art. Thus, the transformation supports structural coherence within the artistic style.",

      "question": "Are the textures of the diced carrots, celery, and onions natural and detailed, without any obvious loss of detail in the Cubist style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Cubist style transformation results in a stylized rendition of the vegetables' textures, forgoing detailed, natural textures for more abstract, painted forms. Image A displays the realistic textures of each vegetable, while Image B simplifies these into bold, flat colors and broad strokes typical of Cubist art. As a result, natural detail is sacrificed, emphasizing artistic expression over photorealism, resulting in an obvious loss of detail.",

      "question": "Do the colors of the diced carrots, celery, and onions appear authentic and harmonious, contributing to the overall natural appearance in the Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the Cubist style employs vibrant and artistic color usage, the colors used for the diced vegetables maintain a harmonious relationship and resemble their natural counterparts in terms of color choiceâ€”orange for carrots, green for celery, and a pale color for onions. Compared to Image A, where the colors are true to life, Image B adapts these colors into an artistic palette that retains authenticity within the context of the style. Hence, the color selection appears authentic and harmonious, contributing to the stylized natural appearance.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the diced vegetables intact and undistorted, without any broken edges or unnatural deformations in the Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B applies a Cubist style to the diced vegetables, which typically involves artistic distortions and stylizations. The geometric shapes are intentionally fragmented and angular, creating a visually interesting composition that may seem distorted or broken compared to Image A, where the shapes are realistic and intact. The stylized approach in Image B means broken edges and deformations are part of the artistic design, thus not appearing as the unchanged, intact shapes of traditional cubes.",

      "question": "Does the knife retain its natural appearance and structural integrity, without any obvious artifacts or distortions in the Cubist style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife remains notably more precise than the other elements and retains recognizable features that suggest a knife, including the blade shape and handle. While it shows some stylization consistent with the Cubist approach, it lacks artifacts or distortions to the extent of being unrecognizable or structurally compromised. Compared to Image A, the knife's basic form and integrity are largely preserved, making it appear more natural amid the styled surroundings.",
