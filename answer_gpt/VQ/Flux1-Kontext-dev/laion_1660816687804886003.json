      "question": "Does the navy blue mesh pattern on the can maintain consistent texture density and alignment without visible warping or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observe the navy blue mesh pattern on the can. The pattern should exhibit a regular texture with consistent spacing and direction. If the mesh appears evenly distributed and aligned without any portion being unnaturally stretched or warped, it meets this criterion. In this case, the pattern appears uniform and maintains its texture without visible distortion.",

      "question": "Is the brand logo clearly visible on the front of the can, correctly proportioned, and free from blurring or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examine the brand logo on the can in Image B. The logo should be prominently displayed, maintaining its expected proportions, clarity, and sharpness. If there is no noticeable blurring or deformation, especially in areas where the logo curves around the can, then it meets the criteria. Based on the visual cues, the logo is clearly visible and proportionate without significant distortion.",

      "question": "Are the embossed lace textures evenly spaced and aligned around the can, without jagged edges or inconsistent depth that suggests digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examine the lace textures depicted as part of the sneaker design transposed onto the can. They should appear as evenly spaced and aligned around the can, avoiding any jagged edges or inconsistencies in texture depth that might indicate digital artifacting. The analysis reveals that these textures appear consistent and smooth, meeting the criteria.",

      "question": "Do the sole stripes wrap seamlessly around the lower half of the can, maintaining their shape and spacing without tearing or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Assess the sole stripes on the lower part of the can in Image B. They should maintain a continuous wrap around without any disruptions in shape or spacing. Look for tears or misalignments in the pattern. Here, the stripes appear to wrap smoothly around the can with proper alignment and consistent spacing, indicating a successful design.",

      "question": "Is the red \"Kickstart\" text clearly readable, properly centered on the white area, and free from shadowing or blurring that would suggest poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Focus on the 'Kickstart' text on the can in Image B. The text should be legible, positioned centrally on the white section. It must be free from visual artifacts like shadowing or blurring, which could suggest poor rendering. The text in Image B is clearly readable and well-centered, without indications of rendering issues.",
