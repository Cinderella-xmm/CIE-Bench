    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cathedral façade maintain detailed textures and depth consistent with the original stone structure, or does it appear uniformly smooth and plastic-like due to the resin material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral façade appears uniformly smooth and lacks the detailed textures and depth present in the original stone structure seen in Image A. The edited image, likely made from resin material, results in a surface that is more plastic-like. When compared to Image A, where stone texture and shadow depth are clearly visible, Image B shows a more homogenized surface due to material differences.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added miniature figures proportionally scaled and positioned so they appear naturally smaller than the cathedral and surrounding buildings without appearing stretched, flattened, or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature figures are carefully scaled and positioned, providing the illusion of depth and proportion relative to the size of the cathedral and surrounding structures. They are positioned naturally in front of the cathedral, appearing proportionate and aligned correctly, unlike any out-of-scale or misaligned objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the miniature lamps emit soft, localized light that appears consistent with their size and placement, without creating unrealistic glows or illuminating areas that should remain in shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature lamps emit a soft, localized light appropriate for their size, contributing to the overall realistic appearance of the diorama. The lighting seems controlled and does not cast unrealistic glows onto the surroundings or illuminate areas in a manner inconsistent with physical laws.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the display case fully integrated around the cathedral and square with clean, continuous edges and no intersecting or fragmented parts that disrupt the geometry of the original structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display case in Image B is well integrated around the cathedral model. It features continuous, clean edges that do not intersect or fragment the depicted scene, maintaining the geometry and structural integrity of the original architecture seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the engraved plaque clearly visible, properly aligned, and styled with appropriate depth and lettering that matches the baroque aesthetic without appearing flat or digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The engraved plaque in Image B is clearly visible and aligned at the front of the display case. It is styled with appropriate depth and baroque lettering, which complements the aesthetic of the cathedral, ensuring it doesn't appear flat or digitally superimposed but instead blends naturally into the design.",
