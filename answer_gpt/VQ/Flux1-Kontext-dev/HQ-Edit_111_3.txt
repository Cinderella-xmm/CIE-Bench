    "Question": "Q1: Are the monochrome line-drawings for the antennae, wings, abdomen, and thorax accurately aligned with the actual anatomy of the butterfly and do they follow its natural contours without overlapping incorrectly or creating geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the line-drawings for the butterfly's antennae, wings, abdomen, and thorax should follow the natural contours of these anatomical features without creating geometric distortions. By examining the image, the lines seem to overlay the correct areas corresponding to the butterfly's body parts, lacking any visible misalignment or incorrect overlap with the butterfly itself, which suggests that they follow the natural contours.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the added pink petals appear seamlessly integrated into the surrounding flora with consistent lighting, texture, and shadow alignment, avoiding any visible seams or artificial edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, added elements like petals need to blend naturally with existing flora. By comparing the pink petals with the overall composition in Image B, they appear matched in lighting and textured consistently with the rest of the image. There is an absence of discernible seams or artificial edges that would typically expose an edit.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the text boxes positioned in non-obtrusive areas of the image, clearly readable, and visually balanced so they do not interfere with the butterfly or floral elements?",
    "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows multiple text boxes added around the butterfly and floral elements. These boxes are strategically placed to avoid overlapping with significant parts of the butterfly and flowers, enhancing readability while maintaining visual balance. The placement is done in such a way as not to interfere with the central elements of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the vibrant blue color of the butterflyâ€™s wings preserved uniformly across all areas, including under and around the overlaid anatomical lines, without any visible discoloration or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays vibrant blue butterfly wings with overlaid anatomical lines. Observing these areas confirms that the blue color remains consistent and uninterrupted by the lines, with no visible signs of discoloration or detail loss, maintaining the original vividness of the butterfly's wings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, pixelation, or unnatural textures in the areas where edits were made (e.g., line drawings, text boxes, added petals)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, visible artifacts could compromise the overall quality. Inspection of edited areas, like line drawings, text boxes, and added petals, reveals no noticeable jagged lines, pixelation, or unnatural textures. This suggests careful editing, ensuring that such artifacts do not present themselves and maintaining image integrity.",
    "answer": "No"
