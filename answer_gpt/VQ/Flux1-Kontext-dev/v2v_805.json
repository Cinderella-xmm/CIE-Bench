        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B features the chibi-style book prominently and the surrounding elements, like the books and lamp, are proportioned in a way that retains focus on the snow globe.

These proportions support the composition, placing emphasis on the central book inside the snow globe.",
