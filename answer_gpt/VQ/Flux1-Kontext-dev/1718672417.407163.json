      "question": "Are the braids on the alpaca’s neck and head seamlessly integrated with metallic ornaments and amulets without visible texture mismatches or broken strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the braids appear to be well-integrated with metal ornaments and amulets. The details show a seamless connection, where the metals are woven into or attached to the braids without visible mismatches in texture or broken strands. This suggests careful attention to detail in the editing, as any mismatches would disrupt the visual harmony between the braids and ornaments.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the newly added Norse-style garments around the alpaca’s body show coherent patterns and visible runic inscriptions without jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Norse-style garments around the alpaca's body are depicted with consistent and coherent patterns. The runic inscriptions appear clear, without any jagged edges or texture artifacts that would typically suggest poor editing or integration. The regularity and clarity of the patterns and inscriptions indicate a high level of detail and quality in the image editing.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the standing stones in the background positioned naturally within the forest scene, with proper scale, shadowing, and mist effects that match the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing stones seem to be positioned in a way that naturally complements the forest scene. Their scale is appropriate in relation to the surrounding trees, and they cast shadows that are consistent with the lighting conditions present in the image. The mist effects around the stones harmonize with the overall misty forest atmosphere, reinforcing their natural integration into the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the metallic components and amulets in the braids anchored realistically, with no floating elements or unnatural angles that suggest poor integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic components and amulets in Image B's braids appear to be securely anchored. They align with the hair strands, showing no signs of floating or being attached at odd angles. This suggests a careful and skillful integration that maintains a realistic appearance, avoiding the pitfalls of poor layering or perspective issues.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the alpaca’s facial features, including eyes, nose, and mouth, proportionally correct and aligned with the rest of the head despite added accessories and styling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the facial part of the image is blurred and thus obscured, one can deduce from the visible part of the neck and the way the accessories are organized that they were likely styled to maintain proportional correctness. Typically, even with additional styling, the basic anatomical proportions are preserved unless intentionally altered.",
