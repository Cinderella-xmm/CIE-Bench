    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the mushroom-shaped rooftops proportionally scaled to the buildings and do they display smooth, continuous surfaces without visible seams or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooftops are shaped like large, exaggerated mushrooms and are significantly larger than the buildings themselves. They possess a smooth, continuous texture without visible seams or distorted geometry. This suggests they are proportionally scaled to appear whimsical rather than realistic, which is a common artistic choice in fantasy settings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lake surface show a uniform, flowing shimmer effect without pixelated or fragmented patterns, and does it reflect the sky and buildings in a way that appears fluid and continuous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lake surface is depicted with a smooth and uniform reflective quality, mirroring the vivid blue sky and surrounding architecture without any noticeable pixelation or fragmentation. The reflections appear fluid and continuous, enhancing the fantastical and coherent aesthetic of the scene.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the mountain structures resemble large, intertwined roots with natural branching patterns, and do they maintain smooth transitions from base to tip without abrupt geometric breaks or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain structures do not resemble large, intertwined roots. Instead, the mountains have a more traditional rocky appearance with a smooth transition from base to tip, and there are no visible abrupt geometric discontinuities or unnatural color shifts. The mountains blend well with the rest of the landscape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the vines connecting the buildings uniformly textured, properly anchored at both ends, and free of floating segments or unnatural bends that violate plant growth logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vines connecting the buildings have a consistent texture and are visibly anchored at the rooftops of the buildings and the large mushroomoid structures. The vines display natural curves and bends, adhering to the logic of plant growth without appearing to float or bend unnaturally.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bridges between buildings have smooth, glowing surfaces with no visible polygonal edges, and are they positioned so that they logically span between architectural supports without floating disconnectedly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridges connecting the structures have a smooth appearance without any jagged or polygonal edges. They are positioned logically, spanning between buildings and other supports in a manner that makes structural sense, avoiding any appearance of disconnection or floating.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the leaf-shaped airships have organic, vein-like textures and hover above the water at a height consistent with their size, with underlying clouds rendered as soft, pastel-colored masses without sharp outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airships do not appear as leaves. Instead, the mushrooms themselves appear to float, but based on this context, the foliage-like structures display a smooth texture with cloud formations rendered in soft pastel hues beneath them, lacking sharp outlines. The floating structures above maintain a height that is consistent with the whimsical scale presented.",
