      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the keys preserved without distortion after being converted into 3D cartoon-style chibi renditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keys are transformed into a 3D cartoon-style. The rendition maintains the fundamental geometric shapes observed in Image A: circular, triangular, and square designs are clearly visible and preserved in the same form. The specific details and shapes of each key, such as the star, the eye, and other decorations, are intact, showing no signs of geometric distortion. The intricate patterns of each key design, although simplified for the cartoon style, are accurately represented and maintain their original shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the red and gold hues used on the keys appear natural and consistent with the Chinese festive theme without introducing unnatural color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the choice of red and gold hues is employed, which are culturally significant and commonly associated with Chinese festivals, symbolizing happiness and prosperity. These colors are consistently applied to each key, with harmonious blending and without any artificial-looking or inconsistent color patches. The use of two colors is managed well, maintaining a festive appearance without any deviation that would disrupt the thematic presentation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the texture of the keys resemble polished, ornamental accessories without introducing unnatural artifacts or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keys are depicted with a smooth, shiny texture commonly found in polished ornamental items. This texture gives a refined and finished appearance to the keys, similar to high-quality plastic or metal accessories. While the texture does simplify compared to a rougher, more detailed look in Image A, there are no unnatural artifacts like jagged edges or rough patches that would detract from this polished look. The key details are rendered clearly, implying an intended stylistic choice aligning with ornamental aesthetics.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the \"Âõç\" paper-cut design in the background complement the keys without disrupting the visual credibility or introducing distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features decorative elements, likely inspired by traditional Chinese paper-cut designs. These decorations are subtly integrated into the overall image without overwhelming the visual focus on the keys. The added elements like flower and star-like patterns remain relevant in style and theme, enhancing rather than detracting from the depiction of the keys. The placement and color choices ensure they complement the main subject (the keys) rather than serve as a distraction.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions and sizes of the keys in the 3D cartoon-style chibi rendition realistic and coherent, avoiding any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the keys have been adapted to a 3D cartoon aesthetic, their proportions relative to each other seem consistent with the original reference from Image A. The sizes of the keys are similar to one another and fit within the expected range of a collection of keys. The cartoon style involves some degree of stylization, but crucially, this does not result in any apparent distortion of proportions, ensuring a coherent and balanced layout that maintains the keys' recognizability.",
