      "question": "Are the polar bears fully intact, with their proportions and textures appearing natural and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the polar bears appear consistent in size, proportions, and texture with what one would expect from natural wildlife images. There is no visible distortion in their appearance, and they seem to be correctly positioned on the ice. World knowledge about polar bears, their appearance and how they are typically portrayed in nature images supports the observation that they look natural in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the cooled color tone appear seamlessly integrated into the environment, avoiding unnatural color gradients or patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ocean and ice maintain a consistent color tone that is typical of colder climates, with natural gradation from the ice to the water. There don't appear to be sudden or unnatural shifts in color that would indicate poor editing or integration. This suggests a seamless blend of colors that aligns with real-world observations of arctic environments.",

      "question": "Is the bold headline \"Only Ice Left. Nowhere to Go.\" free of jagged edges or pixelation and does not obscure important details of the ice and bears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is clear, well-defined, and free from jagged edges or pixelation. It is positioned in the portion of the image above the bears and the ice, ensuring that it does not obscure any key elements of the natural scene depicted in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the organization logo and website at the bottom legible yet unobtrusive, ensuring they do not interfere with the depiction of the ice and bears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo and the website text at the bottom are present but appear to be slightly distorted, which can make them difficult to read. Their placement and color contrast with the ice might obscure their legibility but they do not interfere with the main visual elements of the ice and bears since they are located at the bottom.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the combination of the modified image elements, including the text and logo, uphold a realistic and coherent style without creating any visually confusing elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the main headline is clear and does not disrupt coherence, the logo and the website text at the bottom exhibit issues with legibility and clarity. This creates a slight deviation from a fully realistic and coherent style, as their distortion can detract from the overall professional quality of the modification.",
