      "question": "Does the transformed house maintain consistent geometric shapes without jagged edges, overlapping planes, or unnatural fragmentation that disrupts structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house is depicted in a stylized, colorful manner, resembling a painting. World knowledge suggests that such artistic transformations often compromise geometrical consistency for aesthetic effect. In Image B, the house's structure shows jagged edges and fragmentation typical in this art form, disrupting its structural integrity when compared to realistic representations. The comparison with Image A shows a realistic architecture, confirming the integrity issues in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the abstract representations of the crowd evenly distributed across their original positions without clustering or floating elements that violate spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crowd is represented as colorful dots and shapes. Analyzing these, they are clustered more loosely and have floating aspects, unusual for maintaining spatial logic. World knowledge about abstract art signifies such elements can defy reality for visual appeal. Image A shows a tensely packed crowd against a backdrop, contrasting the abstract portrayal in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the checkered pattern applied uniformly across the entire grass surface without visible seams, inconsistent spacing, or distortion at edges near sand traps and water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass area does not present a checkered pattern but rather abstract treatment using swirling color applications. Therefore, no uniform checkered pattern exists across different areas like sand traps and water, which exhibit noticeable color gradients. World knowledge and comparison with the realistic grass from Image A further illustrates these inconsistencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the prismatic shards in the water reflect the house and sky in fragmented but coherent angular segments without ghosting, blurring, or unnatural color separation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The abstract water reflection in Image B features prismatic shards reflecting vibrant angular segments. Despite their creative layout, they exhibit unnatural fragmentation and color separation, deviating from expected coherence. In comparison, Image A shows a coherent realistic reflection, reinforcing the unnatural composition in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the vibrant geometric planes on the houseâ€™s facade consistently lit and shaded to match the ambient light direction, avoiding unnatural highlights or shadow mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays vibrant blocks on the house facade that although eye-catching, do not exhibit consistent lighting or shading. World knowledge on shading suggests discrepancies, such as mismatched highlights, indicate lighting inconsistencies. Observing Image A reveals natural lighting that contrasts with these mismatches in Image B.",
