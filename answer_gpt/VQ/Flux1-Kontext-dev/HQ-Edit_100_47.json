      "question": "Does the mirror-like surface in the foreground reflect the sky, trees, and Eiffel Tower with clear, undistorted imagery and smooth texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the reflection on the water surface displays clarity and smooth texture without evident distortion. The reflected objects, including the sky, trees, and parts of the Eiffel Tower, appear coherent and seamlessly represented, indicating a well-rendered reflection. The waterâ€™s surface acts as a smooth mirror, showing a realistic portrayal of its surroundings. Comparing with the appropriate method of reflection, the mirroring features seem accurate. Therefore, the reflection is clear and undistorted.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the distant buildings and tree clusters positioned at distinct depth layers without overlapping or misaligned edges that suggest incorrect layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distant buildings and tree clusters are visually positioned with distinct depth differentiations, exhibiting no obvious overlaps or edge misalignments. The image effectively maintains spatial separation, allowing for realistic depth perception between objects. Given the architectural knowledge and perspective understanding, such consistent alignment suggests proper layering within the artistic construction. The logical depth ordering contributes to the overall sense of realism.",

      "question": "Do the small pedestrian figures on the pathways have consistent proportions, recognizable body parts, and smooth textures without visible deformities or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of the pedestrian figures in Image B, they maintain consistent proportions, possess recognizable body parts, and display smooth textures. Each figure is proportionally represented, supporting identification as individual people without visible deformities or artifacts. Human anatomical proportions and texture expectations reveal an accurate portrayal of miniature figures, showcasing the artist's skill in managing scale fidelity.",

      "question": "Is the dark frame with metallic edges present around the entire perimeter of the image, appearing solid and uniformly integrated without breaks or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame encloses the image with dark and metallic edges along its perimeter. Consistent visual integration and structural integrity suggest that the frame holds solid boundaries, exhibiting no breaks or misalignments. The metallic edging adds to the framing's coherence, enhancing the picture presentation without disrupting the uniformity. Frame continuity and border styling fit within a typical method of sleek and coherent framing.",

      "question": "Are the engraved city names and coordinates along the frame legible, precisely aligned, and free from pixelation or uneven spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the engraved text along the frame in Image B, they maintain legibility, with precise alignment devoid of pixelation or inconsistent spacing. The choice and execution of engraving style preserve clarity and manage uniform letter spacing, ensuring easy readability. The application of engraving technique on image borders generally focuses on elegance and clarity, as evidenced in this image.",
