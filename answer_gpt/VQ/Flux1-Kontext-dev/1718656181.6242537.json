      "question": "Are the cloud formations above the explosion composed of distinct geometric shapes that follow the overall contour of the mushroom cloud without disrupting its volumetric form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cloud formations are stylized using bold, thick black outlines and filled with bright neon colors, creating a cartoon-like, pop art aesthetic. Instead of emphasizing volumetric form with shading or gradients, the image uses flat colors that follow the general shape of a mushroom cloud. This artistic choice maintains the overall contour without adding unnecessary complexity that might disrupt the composition. Therefore, the geometric shapes, in this context, align with the intended style while preserving the mushroom cloud's recognizable outline.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the neon-colored elements in the explosion maintain consistent brightness and contrast relative to the surrounding sky and water, avoiding abrupt or physically implausible luminance shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artist employs a consistent use of neon colors across all elements, including the explosion, sky, and water. These colors are bold and uniformly saturated, typical of pop art. The brightness and contrast are deliberately exaggerated for effect, but they remain consistent within the stylized aesthetic. There are no abrupt or jarring luminance shifts that break the visual coherence, as the entire scene is harmonized through the repeated use of fluorescent colors and strong outlines.",

      "question": "Are the palm trees depicted with thick black outlines and simplified shapes, positioned correctly along the beach wall without overlapping or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees are depicted using thick black outlines and simplified, almost cartoonish shapes, typical of the pop art style. They are positioned correctly along the beach and are integrated into the composition without overlapping or misaligned edges. The outlines and shapes work with the overall aesthetic, contributing to a harmonious and orderly layout that is visually coherent. This ensures they are a coherent part of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the islandâ€™s terrain been reduced to abstract geometric shapes that maintain correct spatial relationships with the sea and horizon, without floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the island is depicted in a simplified form consistent with the stylized pop art approach. The terrain is reduced to basic geometric shapes and dark outlines that integrate well with the horizon and water, maintaining correct spatial relationships. The abstraction does not result in any floating or disconnected sections; rather, it creates a flat yet cohesive visual representation of the island that logically fits with the rest of the imagery. The integrity of the island's placement relative to its surroundings is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sky and water rendered with flat colors and clean outlines, matching the pop art style, without visible texture degradation or mismatched lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky and water use flat colors and clean outlines, which are trademarks of the pop art style. These elements lack any gradients or textures, creating a smooth and uniform appearance. The lighting effects are stylized, not mimicking natural lighting but instead enhancing the vibrant and flamboyant aesthetic of the image. There are no signs of texture degradation or mismatches, as the entire scene, from sky to water, is cohesive in its flatness and stylistic execution.",
