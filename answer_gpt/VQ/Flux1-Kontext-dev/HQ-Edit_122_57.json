    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the crystal vase maintain the original shape and proportions of the ceramic vase, with clear faceted surfaces that follow the curvature without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is a clear crystal vase with smooth curves and a uniform surface. In Image A, the vase is an ornate ceramic piece with complex designs and embellishments that are intrinsically different in shape and style. The crystal vase does not have the same intricate shape or proportions. Therefore, the crystal vase does not maintain the original shape of the ceramic vase.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the abstract floral patterns on the crystal vase etched into the surface with uniform depth and clarity, without appearing superimposed or blurred?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal vase appears smooth and transparent, designed with subtle etchings but without any visible abstract floral patterns like those described. The etched decorations are delicate but clear, and there are no traces indicating them being superimposed or blurred. The vase appears clean with potential light design reflecting uniformly.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the crystal flowers retain the recognizable shapes of the original blooms and display internal refraction and pastel coloration without appearing solid or opaque?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers are depicted with soft pastel colors, and their daisy-like form is evident. They appear light and delicate, suggesting pastel coloration, but there's no explicit indication of crystal structure or internal refraction. They do not appear to be solid or opaque, maintaining a soft and almost translucent appearance unlike an actual crystal structure.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mirrored pedestal flat and reflective, showing a clear, undistorted reflection of the crystal vase and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal vase is placed on a clear, glass-like pedestal, which is smooth and reflective. It provides a clear and accurate reflection of the vase, maintaining optical fidelity without distortion. This suggests it is flat and effectively mirrors its surroundings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting show realistic refraction and internal glow in the crystal elements, with soft highlights and no unnatural bright spots or flat shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting on the crystal vase in Image B highlights its transparency and gentle curvature without harsh contrasts or unnatural bright spots. The highlights are soft, and the vase's transparency offers a sense of depth and internal light diffusion rather than flat shading. This would be indicative of realistic refraction and highlight within crystal elements.",
