      "question": "Does the glass candle chamber maintain consistent transparency and refractive qualities with natural glass, and are the embossed gold floral motifs clearly defined without distortion or unnatural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass candle chamber surrounding the teapot is stylistically crafted to give the appearance of a luxurious gift box rather than a traditional glass chamber. The surrounding material appears to be solid red with patterned gold elements, indicating that it is not designed to be a transparent glass chamber. The gold floral motifs are clearly defined in the gift box without noticeable distortion or unnatural texture, suggesting high-quality craftsmanship typically seen in decorative packaging. However, the comparison with Image A, where the chamber is absent, points out that the red and gold elements are not meant to be glass; hence, there isnâ€™t an issue of maintaining glass-like transparency or refractive qualities.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the camel red hue of the glass candle chamber evenly distributed and visually harmonious with the surrounding silver and gold elements, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural saturation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red hue is consistently and evenly applied to the gift packaging surrounding the teapot, with harmonious integration with the gold floral motifs. The overall appearance does not display any abrupt color shifts or unnatural saturation. The chosen colors complement each other well, contributing to a visually appealing package that aligns with luxury presentation standards. Comparing with Image A, where only the teapot surface uses red hues and silver/gold finishes, Image B maintains a deliberate and aesthetic hue distribution within its own intended style.",

      "question": "Does the wooden lid accurately reflect the contour and curvature of the original teapot handle, and does it display natural wood grain and polish without visible artifacts or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden lid is part of the box design and doesn't reflect the contour or curvature of the teapot handle, as these aspects pertain more to packaging than to recreating teapot components. The lid is a solid red, uniform with the gift box packaging, lacking wood grain or polish detail typical of actual wooden finishes. In contrast, Image A showcases a polished wooden table surface, reflecting light naturally. Therefore, in Image B, the question of wooden lid accuracy is not applicable due to the absence of wooden materials on the packaging.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the brand logo positioned on the base in a way that aligns with the existing decorative elements, and does it lack jagged edges, misalignment, or unnatural contrast that would suggest digital insertion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand logo 'REXEL JASEN' is positioned neatly on the base of the gift box below the teapot. It is aligned with the decorative elements, including the embossed pattern of the box, and the gold lettering matches the tone and style consistently. The logo shows no evidence of jagged edges, misalignment, or unnatural contrast, suggesting a well-integrated physical branding approach rather than a digital overlay.",

      "question": "Does the newly added patterned fabric background exhibit consistent texture, proper lighting interaction, and seamless integration with the teapot's shadow and reflection on the surface below, without visible seams or lighting discrepancies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterned fabric background is designed to match the luxurious theme of the packaging. The floral design on the box and the background complement each other, creating a cohesive visual, with the ambient lighting appearing consistent across the elements. The teapot's reflection and shadow interaction are well-integrated with the background, lacking visible seams or lighting discrepancies. Comparing this with Image A, where the lighting creates a dynamic shadow on the surface, Image B succeeds in maintaining a seamless presentation suited to product photography.",
