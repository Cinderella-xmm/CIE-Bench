    "Question": "Q1: Do the textures and materials of the baseball and glove appear natural and consistent in all three views?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the texture and material of the baseball appear to be consistent with the visual expectations. The leather of the glove has a natural appearance, showcasing the typical stitching and piping found on such items, and the surface details of the baseball, including the seams, visually represent real-world characteristics. The consistency in texture and material perception is evident as these features are displayed similarly across all three views.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the proportions of the baseball and glove accurate and maintain their expected size relationships in all three views?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the baseball fits naturally within the glove's pocket, which suggests correct proportional sizing between both objects. Given that a baseball typically fits snugly into a glove used for catching it, the proportional relationship seen here is consistently maintained across all three views, aligning with real-world expectations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are there any visible artifacts, such as jagged edges or unnatural blending, around the baseball or glove in all three views?",
    "explanation": "Image B is examined for any signs of artifacts such as jagged edges or unnatural blending, particularly at the boundaries of the objects. No visible artifacts are detected in any of the viewsâ€”the quality of the image outlines offers smooth edges and blends well against the background, indicating the editing did not introduce such errors.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the shadows and highlights on the baseball and glove look natural and consistent with the lighting conditions in all three views?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the light plays across the surface of the glove and the baseball, creating natural shadows and highlights. The lighting consistency is maintained across all views, with patterns such as soft shadowing on the grass and subtle glove curvature reflecting believable lighting conditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the composition and layout in each of the three views (top, side, sectional) logically represent the baseball and glove in a visually credible manner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each view offers a credible representation of the baseball and glove. The side and sectional views show the glove and baseball in coherent positions as they would appear in a real-world setup. These compositions maintain logical spatial relationships and provide credibility to their visual presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
