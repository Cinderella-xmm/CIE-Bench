      "question": "Do the neon lighting effects seamlessly integrate with the mirror reflection, avoiding any artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon lighting effects on the mirror frame appear consistent with the reflection in the mirror. The neon effects are not visibly disrupted by artifacts or unnatural textures. The smooth and continuous pink light around the mirror and its reflection indicates careful integration, suggesting that these effects have been well applied without introducing visible distortions.",

      "question": "Does the gradient background complement the sink area geometry, maintaining structural coherence and avoiding broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gradient background transitions smoothly between colors and complements the design of the sink area. The colors enhance the visual appeal while preserving the shapes and features of the sink and cabinet without any misalignment or distortion of the geometry. The structural coherence appears intact, demonstrating that the gradient is applied thoughtfully to maintain harmony with the sink features.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the materials and textures of the black cabinet visually credible, retaining fine details and avoiding unnatural changes after applying the vaporwave style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the black cabinet with its materials and textures still detailed despite the vaporwave effects. The material appears consistently smooth and representative of a typical cabinet texture, without unnatural changes or loss in detail. The editing retains the cabinet's structural and material integrity, indicating that the vaporwave style has been applied without compromising the visual credibility of the cabinet's texture.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the faucet and soap dispenser area retained their natural appearance without any loss of detail or introduction of artifacts during the vaporwave style conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faucet and soap dispenser maintain clarity and detail, showing no apparent loss nor introduction of artifacts. The vaporwave style, characterized by vibrant colors and lighting effects, does not distort or obscure these elements, indicating that they have been preserved well during the styling process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the placements of neon lighting effects around the mirror and sink area preserve visual plausibility, ensuring physical rationality and absence of distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows neon lighting effectively applied around the mirror and sink area without disrupting the essential structure and design. The lighting effects follow a logical placement, marking typical edges and frames of the furniture, preserving the overall visual plausibility. The absence of distortion or irrational placement of the neon effects ensures that the integration maintains physical rationality within the given context.",
