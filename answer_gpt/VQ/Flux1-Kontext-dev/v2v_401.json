      "question": "Do the croissants, macarons, and cupcakes retain their natural texture and appearance after being incorporated into the treasure map design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the croissants, macarons, and cupcakes exhibit a stylized appearance, as evidenced by the illustrative nature of the treasure map design. The texture and appearance have been altered to fit the artistic style of the map, which is distinctly different from their natural, realistic depiction in Image A. Visual cues such as the contours and shading are altered to resemble drawings rather than real desserts. Combining this visual information with the understanding that a treasure map illustration typically adopts a more artistic depiction, it's evident that these items do not retain their natural texture and appearance.",

      "question": "Is the dotted trail leading to the frosting-shaped 'X' integrated smoothly without causing any unnatural textures or loss of detail on the surrounding desserts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dotted trail that guides the viewer's eye to the frosting-shaped 'X'. The trail is artistically woven into the design, not causing any significant distortion or compromising the details of the nearby desserts. The cupcakes and macarons maintain their stylized illustration like the rest of the map without losing clarity or detail, which suggests that the integration is smooth and deliberate, coordinating with the theme.",

      "question": "Do the sugar-coated compass rose and berries appear naturally placed and enhance the dessert-themed journey without looking out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The compass rose and berries in Image B are part of the artistic illustration style of a treasure map, supporting the dessert theme without looking disparate. The compass rose, though ornamental, fits the map motif and the berries are styled similarly to the other food elements, harmonizing with the map narrative. By considering the usual harmony in themed illustrations, we understand that these elements contribute to the aesthetics rather than clash with them.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the desserts consistent and realistic within the context of the treasure map, avoiding any distortion or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the desserts in a deliberately stylized format as part of the treasure map. Although the proportions and shapes are consistent within their illustrated style, they aren't realistic as in Image A where the physical presence and natural proportions are more prominent. The representation in Image B aligns with the illustrative nature, where a bit of exaggerated or aesthetic scaling is typical, thus they are consistent within the artistic intent but not realistic.",

      "question": "Does the weathered parchment background integrate seamlessly with the desserts, preserving their fine details and avoiding any visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B adopts a treasure map aesthetic characterized by a weathered parchment background. The desserts blend into this background style without noticeable artifacts or detail loss that distracts from the map theme. Given the illustrative nature of the map design, the integration is artistically crafted, providing a cohesive look that maintains the intended fine details of the map elements, indicating a seamless integration in the context of the map illustration.",
