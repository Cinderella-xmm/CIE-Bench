    "Question": "Q1: Do the extended stripes seamlessly blend into the grass without creating unnatural textures or patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the zebra continue into the grass, creating a unified, artistic effect. The use of bold, stylized lines and a consistent yellow-green palette throughout the grass and zebra's stripes results in a harmonious design. However, the bold contrast between black and white stripes and the surrounding yellow-green background is intentional and artistic, not meant to represent a 'natural' look. Given the artistic style of Image B, the transition and pattern don't appear unnatural within the context of the stylization.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the stripes extended in a way that preserves the original geometric structure and proportions of the zebra's body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes are extended in an artistic manner. The zebra's inherent geometric structure is somewhat simplified to fit into the stylized design, emphasizing bold lines and patterns. While this alteration serves the artwork's theme, it doesn't strictly maintain the original animal's anatomy or proportions as seen in a real-world context. The focus is on the aesthetic of the stylization rather than anatomical accuracy.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image maintain a visually credible composition where the zebra remains the focal point without being overshadowed by the surreal extension of its stripes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are very prominent and occupy much of the visual space, yet the composition keeps the zebra as the focus due to the bold contrast of black and white stripes against a less intense yellow-green background. The zebra remains distinct in the foreground, ensuring that despite the surreal extensions, it is not overshadowed, maintaining it as the focal point of the composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are key features of the zebra such as its mane, ears, and legs still clearly visible and natural looking amidst the surreal extension of its stripes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the key features of the zebra like its mane, ears, and legs are distinctly visible despite the surreal styling of the image. The mane retains its characteristic pattern, and the ears are recognizable, along with the leg patterns. While the entire image has a stylized appearance, these features are preserved clearly in this stylization.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the fine details of the zebra's stripes and the grass been preserved without noticeable degradation or introduction of artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses bold stylization which emphasizes large block patterns over fine details. The concept of 'fine detail' is therefore interpreted within the context of the art style's own consistency and coherence, rather than comparing it to realism. Thus, within this stylistic framework, there are no noticeable artifacts or degradation affecting the image's fidelity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
