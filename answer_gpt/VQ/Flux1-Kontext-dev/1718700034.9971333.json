      "question": "Are the crystal shards forming the wings symmetrically aligned and structurally coherent, without visible gaps, misaligned facets, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are made of crystal shards that are positioned symmetrically on either side of the subject. The crystals appear evenly aligned with each other, showing no signs of gaps or misalignment in the facets. The overall structure seems coherent and well-integrated, suggesting careful placement of each shard.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays hair that appears to be naturally flowing with the addition of golden tones, likely meant to simulate natural highlights. The hair smoothly integrates into the original hair without any floating strands or sections that seem disconnected from the main hair, maintaining a cohesive look.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt appears to exhibit a consistent texture that resembles velvet. The fabric texture looks uniform without any noticeable repetitions or digital artifacts. The lighting and shadowing on the shirt are natural, contributing to the overall realism of the shirt's appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background presents as a solid deep gray, consistent throughout the image. There are no visible edges, lighting anomalies, or remnants of any previous or alternative scene that might suggest editing inconsistencies. The background provides a stable and uniform backdrop.",

      "question": "Are all edited elements—crystal wings, leafy hair, and velvet shirt—properly aligned with the body and each other, without clipping, overlapping errors, or positional distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases edited elements such as crystal wings, golden hair, and the velvet shirt that all align correctly with the body of the subject. There are no visible signs of clipping or overlapping errors, and the placement appears seamless and true to the expected positions in a well-executed composite image.",
