      "question": "Does the horse's musculature display intricate detail and natural texture without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's musculature is visibly detailed, showcasing smooth and realistic contours that suggest careful texturing. The sheen on the horse's coat further emphasizes a believable texture. The lack of pixelation or odd patterns indicates that the musculature depiction is natural and artifact-free.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lighting effects on the horse and elephant consistent with a Renaissance-inspired style and do they enhance the anatomical features naturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B exhibits a dramatic chiaroscuro effect, characteristic of a Renaissance-inspired style, with pronounced highlights and shadows that accentuate the anatomical features naturally. The light and shadow play creates a three-dimensional depth and emphasizes the contours of the horse and elephant sculpturally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the elephant's skin retain its natural texture and fine details without any visible degradation or unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's skin appears smooth with clear textural definition, showing the typical wrinkledness one would expect in real life. The absence of pixelation or repetitive artificial patterns indicates that the skin's depiction remains natural and finely detailed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical structure of the horse and elephant appear rational and consistent with their anatomical forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination, the proportions of the horse and elephant in Image B appear anatomically correct and consistent. Each animal's structure aligns with their respective forms without distortion or unusual scaling that would make them appear unrealistic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition of the horse standing on a platform above the elephant visually credible and structurally coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B, where the horse stands on a platform above the elephant, appears structurally coherent given the artistic license. However, while the elements align logically, the concept inherently challenges physical plausibility in real-world physics, yet in artistic representation, it maintains a visual logic.",
