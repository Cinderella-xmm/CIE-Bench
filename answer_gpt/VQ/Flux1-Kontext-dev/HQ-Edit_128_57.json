      "question": "Does the desk exhibit continuous, realistic embossed wood textures across its surface without visible seams, irregularities, or artificial-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden case shows a smooth, uniform wood texture across its surface, typical of high-quality woodworking. There are no visible seams or irregularities, and the design incorporates seamless embossing which appears natural. This observation indicates detailed craftsmanship akin to real wood embossing, leading to the conclusion that the desk indeed exhibits such features.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the writing pad positioned flatly on the desk with uniform edges and natural aging effects such as slight discoloration and texture variation, without warped or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The notebook in Image B appears to be aligned flat against the surface of the wooden drawer. The edges are straight, and there are no apparent signs of warping or broken geometry. The aged look is achieved through slight discoloration and variation in texture, especially at the edges, which is often indicative of natural wear over time.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the quill-shaped logo rendered with a raised, metallic gold finish that shows subtle highlights and shadows consistent with embossed foil, without smearing or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The quill logo on the box in Image B is designed to mirror the appearance of embossed gold foil. The highlights and shadows are subtle and consistent with how light interacts with metallic surfaces. There is no smearing or unnatural sheen, which confirms that it is accurately rendered to simulate a metallic gold finish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ink bottle placed stably on the desk surface with proportional size and shape consistent with real glass bottles, and does the spine of the pad show clear, readable etched text without blurring or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ink bottle on Image B is proportionate in size and maintains a realistic glass bottle shape. It appears stably positioned on the desk. The spine of the notebook displays text that is clearly etched, without any blurring or ghosting effects, indicating that the bottle and text are appropriately rendered to match real objects.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all modified elements (desk, pad, quill logo, ink bottle) proportionally aligned and spatially coherent, forming a unified vintage stationery package layout without floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all the elements - the wooden case, the notebook, the quill logo, and the ink bottle - are arranged to form a cohesive and proportionate layout. Each component appears properly aligned with respect to one another, without signs of misalignment or floating. The spatial coherence and proportionality are all maintained, creating a unified and aesthetically pleasing vintage stationery presentation.",
