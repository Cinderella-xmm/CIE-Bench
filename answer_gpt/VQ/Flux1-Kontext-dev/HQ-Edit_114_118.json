    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the curved glass dome have a smooth, seamless surface without visible seams, scratches, or unnatural distortions that disrupt the visual continuity of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome encases the scene with a smooth, curved surface. When examining the glass dome, it appears to have no visible seams, scratches, or distortions that interfere with the overall visual integrity. This visual continuity suggests a high-quality presentation often seen in objects designed to showcase scenes clearly and elegantly. Therefore, the surface of the dome is smooth and seamless.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the sails exhibit layered, folded paper-like textures with consistent shadows and depth, without geometric distortions or flattened areas that deviate from their original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sails in Image B retain their three-dimensional appearance and structure, reflecting light and showing depth through shadows cast on portions of the sail, resembling layered, folded textures. Such characteristics suggest that the sails maintain their authentic shape and do not exhibit significant geometric distortions or flattened areas in the representation within the glass dome.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the blue resin layer below the ship show consistent translucency, internal glow, and wave-like patterns without abrupt transitions or unnatural textures at the hull interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a blue resin layer that provides a visual representation of the sea beneath the ship. The resin shows a consistent translucency and an internal glow that adds depth and realism, resembling wave-like patterns prevalent in realistic ocean depictions. The consistency without abrupt changes or unnatural interfaces at the ship's hull indicates a well-crafted representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the seagulls connected by faint, straight wires that do not interfere with their natural flight positions or create visible mechanical supports?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows seagulls flying around the ship with no visible wires, strings, or mechanical supports. They appear naturally positioned in flight within the scene encased in the dome, supporting a visually unencumbered depiction of birds without artificial connection or support interfering with natural positions.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all elements (ship, sails, water, birds, sky) correctly positioned and scaled within the glass dome without clipping, overlapping, or misalignment that compromises structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each element inside the glass dome, including the ship, sails, water, seagulls, and sky, appears properly scaled and aligned. There is no visible clipping, overlapping, or misalignment that detracts from the overall coherence of the encased scene. The positioning allows for a structured, harmonious presentation within the limited confines of the dome.",
