      "question": "Does the character’s head appear significantly larger than the body while maintaining smooth contours and proper alignment of limbs and torso without visible stretching or tearing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character depicted showcases a comically larger head compared to its body, which is a common stylistic choice in animated illustrations, often known as 'caricature.' The proportions are intentionally exaggerated, yet the rest of the body retains proper alignment with a smooth connection between all components, maintaining a consistent cartoon style, thus the contours are smooth and no stretching or tearing is visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the character’s suit evenly distributed, free from repeating tiles or jagged edges, and do they follow a logical direction consistent with fabric draping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character's suit in Image B is adorned with vibrant, abstract patterns. These patterns are evenly distributed across the suit, without obvious repetition or jagged edges, and the pattern flows naturally along the suit's contours, following a logical direction consistent with the drape and cut of the fabric typical in stylized animation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the oversized glasses fully rendered with clear lenses and frames, aligned with the eye region, and without partial transparency or clipping against facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character doesn't have visible oversized glasses, therefore, there can't be any issues related to lenses, frame transparency, or alignment against facial features. There's no context to judge oversized glasses rendering in this image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the hand have exactly five fingers, with natural curvature and spacing, and are there no distorted knuckles, extra digits, or unnatural shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B has a hand raised with exactly five fingers, which are all evenly spaced with a natural curvature typical of animated depiction. There are no additional fingers or unnatural shadows, and the animated style maintains a smooth, playful presentation without distortion at the knuckles.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the abstract skyscrapers and balloons positioned at plausible distances, casting soft shadows, and aligned with the character’s perspective without floating above ground or appearing detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The abstract elements such as skyscrapers and balloons in Image B are positioned in a colorful and surreal backdrop typical of animated scenes. They are aligned with the perspective of the scene in such a way that they fit within the creative and fantastical composition of the image. These elements do not appear detached or floating unnaturally, and the colorful style negates any typical shadowing issues.",
