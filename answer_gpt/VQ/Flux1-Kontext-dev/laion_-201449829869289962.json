      "question": "Does the dome glass case show smooth transparency with realistic light interaction and no visible stitching or warping around the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dome glass case appears to have a smooth, transparent surface with realistic light reflections. There are no visible distortions such as stitching or warping along the edges, which indicates that it has been rendered with attention to how light would naturally interact with a curved glass surface. This kind of smoothness and realism in the reflection and transparency is essential for creating a convincing glass effect.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dimensions of the church tower, roof, and adjacent buildings proportionally consistent with one another as if reduced uniformly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all elements like the church tower, roof, and adjacent buildings appear scaled down to fit within a dome diorama. The proportions between these structures remain consistent, suggesting a uniform reduction in size, which maintains the architectural relationships between them visually intact. This uniformity contributes to a coherent model-like miniature that reflects the correct proportions of the original scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the newly added small houses aligned with the original architectural style and do they have correctly shaped roofs, windows, and textures without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small houses at the base of the structure match the architectural style of the other elements, with appropriately shaped roofs, windows, and textures that blend seamlessly. There is no visible deformation or inconsistency, which indicates careful modeling to ensure they align aesthetically with the scene's original characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the copper roof on the church tower display realistic texture variations, oxidation effects, and lighting response consistent with real copper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the copper roof of the church tower shows slight variations in texture and color, consistent with the patina and oxidation effects copper undergoes over time. Additionally, the lighting on the roof reacts appropriately to simulate reflections and shadows. These elements contribute to a realistic appearance of the copper material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mist along the distant mountains smoothly diffused with gradual opacity changes and no abrupt edges or blocky patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the mist over the distant mountains is rendered smoothly, with a natural gradation of opacity that gives depth to the scene. There are no harsh edges or pixelation, suggesting a careful application of mist effects to enhance the natural appearance of a distant landscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the gold pedestal positioned directly under the base of the diorama and does it have a solid, grounded appearance with no floating or misaligned parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold pedestal is shown as directly supporting the dome structure, providing a stable base for the diorama. It appears to be correctly aligned and has a solid, grounded look, without any elements that seem to float or be misaligned. This positioning provides a stable and realistic appearance to the overall structure.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the terraced vineyards show consistent spacing and natural curvature without visible grid lines or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the terraced vineyards are depicted with natural curvature and consistent spacing. There are no visible grid lines or pixelation, suggesting a smooth transition in the terracing and a realistic presentation of the landscape feature. This attention to detail in the depiction of vineyards enhances the realism of the miniature scene.",
