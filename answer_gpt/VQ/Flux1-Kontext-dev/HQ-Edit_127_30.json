      "question": "Does the transformed violin body maintain consistent surface texture and lighting behavior with a high-quality engraved case, without unnatural sheen or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a violin with a high-quality engraved case. The surface texture of the violin, when placed in the case, appears smooth and consistent. The lighting enhances the varnished wood appearance, which is desirable for such instruments. The violin's finish has a natural sheen that complements the case's lush interior without showing any unnatural textures or reflections that could suggest mismatches.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chinrest and tailpiece seem to exhibit a uniform coloration and material consistency that is typical of high-quality violin fittings. There are no visible seams or mismatched reflections indicating a discord between the materials. The gold accents are cleanly applied with no color bleeding or distracting artifact, suggesting seamless integration with the adjacent areas on the instrument.",

      "question": "Is the scripted font along the strings clearly legible, aligned with string curvature, and free from distortion or floating effects that suggest digital overlay errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a scripted font positioned above the strings within the case setting. The font is clear and legible. It appears to follow a natural curvature aligned with the violin strings, avoiding distortion. There are no visible signs suggesting it is floating or improperly overlaid on the image, which indicates a precise digital integration.",
