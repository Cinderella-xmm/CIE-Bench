      "question": "Are the neon accents added to the motorcycle’s body emitting a consistent, smooth glow without harsh edges or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon accents on the motorcycle are analyzed for consistency in glow and edge smoothness. The visual information suggests that the neon accents emit a uniform glow, which is evenly distributed without any noticeable pixelation or harsh edges. This conclusion is drawn by observing the smooth light emission along the motorcycle’s contours, which indicates a carefully applied effect.",

      "question": "Do the hover wheels maintain symmetrical, closed geometric forms without visible deformation or broken spokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the hover wheels are checked for symmetry and the integrity of form. They present as complete geometric entities, with no visible distortions or evidence of broken spokes. By evaluating the smoothness and regularity of the circular wheel forms, along with the even pattern of the spokes, it’s evident that the design maintains its intended symmetry.",

      "question": "Is the digital interface seamlessly embedded in the front panel without intersecting or obscuring existing elements like the headlight or mirrors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital interface is assessed for its integration with the front panel of the motorcycle. Based on the visual assessment, the digital interface appears to be well-embedded without disrupting the motorcycle’s original components such as the headlight or mirrors. The careful placement and continuity of the panel design suggest a seamless addition, showcasing a harmonious integration without visual interference.",

      "question": "Does the isometric box exhibit uniform edge lengths and correct angles, with no skewed faces or misaligned corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The isometric box in Image B is evaluated for structural precision. Visually, the box exhibits uniform edge lengths and angles that reflect an accurately constructed isometric form. The corners are aligned correctly, with no evidence of skewed faces, indicating a meticulously designed box that adheres to geometric principles. This conclusion is supported by consistent straight lines and angles throughout the box’s shape.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transparent window free of warping, chromatic aberration, or ghosting that would distort the view of the motorcycle behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transparent window in Image B is scrutinized for any visual anomalies such as warping or aberrations. The analysis reveals that the window provides a clear, undistorted view of the motorcycle behind it. There are no indications of warping, chromatic aberration, or ghosting effects, ensuring the motorcycle is visible in its true form without any optical distortions. Thus, the window maintains clarity and transparency.",
