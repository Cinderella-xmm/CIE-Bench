      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the subject maintain a recognizable likeness to the original person despite being transformed into an enamel pin style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is transformed into an enamel pin style, which inherently simplifies and stylizes features. However, notable elements such as the white, curly hair and slight postural inclination are retained which strongly suggest the likeness to Albert Einstein. Based on the depiction of these distinct characteristics, the likeness is maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glossy metal outlines smooth and free of any rough or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The enamel pin style of Image B features clear, bold outlines, which appear smooth and continuous without any visible roughness or pixelation. This clean finishing is typical for enamel pins, where the edges are meant to mimic metal outlines.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the subject retain its proper proportions and geometric shapes, avoiding any distortion or exaggerated features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, while stylized, maintains the overall proportions and structures typically associated with such a representation. The subject's hair and posture are represented accurately in terms of scale and do not show any distortion beyond what is usual for an enamel pin style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the subject's facial hair and hairline been preserved accurately in the enamel pin rendition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the enamel pin style in Image B, which tends to simplify details, some intricate details might not be preserved with high fidelity. Despite this, the key traits like the hair's flow and basic hairline are apparent even in the simplified form, but any very fine details would inherently be abstracted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background clean, uniformly white, and free from any unwanted artifacts or additional features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a solid, uniform white, without any visible artifacts or additional elements disrupting its cleanliness, which is common in enamel pin designs to emphasize the subject itself.",
