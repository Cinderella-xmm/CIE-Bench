      "question": "Are the tentacle-like extensions smoothly integrated into the original curves of the facade without sudden angular breaks or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tentacle-like extensions appear to smoothly follow the organic curves of the building's facade. The integration of these extensions maintains the undulating lines and contours present in the structure, avoiding any abrupt angles or disjointed sections that could disrupt the flow. The extensions seem to merge naturally with the building's original design. Therefore, based on the visual cues, the integration is without sudden angular breaks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the fibrous textures follow the curvature of the facade and appear continuous without repeating patterns or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features fibrous textures that seem to wrap around the building's facade, following its curves seamlessly. These textures are depicted as continuous and flowing, enhancing the natural fluidity of the overall design. There are no visible repeating patterns or jagged edges that would indicate a lack of continuity or disrupt the integration across the facade.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the window areas replaced with translucent membranes that maintain soft light transmission and lack sharp borders or visible seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window areas appear to be covered with translucent materials that allow a soft, glowing light to pass through. These membranes maintain an ethereal appearance, without showing any sharp borders or seams. The visual representation suggests that the light transmission is uniform across the surface, contributing to a cohesive and undisturbed facade.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the iridescent scale patterns align with the surface curvature and display smooth color transitions without flat or distorted regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scale patterns in Image B are depicted as iridescent and follow the curves of the facade, enhancing the organic design. The colors appear to transition smoothly without abrupt changes or flat, distorted areas that could disrupt the visual harmony. This integration contributes to the realistic and cohesive appearance of the building's altered design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bio-luminescent lines emit a soft, uneven glow that fades naturally at the edges and interacts with nearby surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bio-luminescent lines in Image B emit a gentle, uneven glow, which gradually fades toward the edges, creating a natural transition of light. This effect interacts with the surrounding surfaces by enhancing the atmospheric and immersive quality of the design. The glow contributes to dynamic lighting, providing depth and dimensionality to the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all modified elements—tentacles, membranes, textures, and glow lines—properly anchored to the building structure without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all modified elements appear to be well-integrated with the building structure. The tentacles, membranes, textures, and glow lines are firmly attached and aligned with the original architecture, avoiding floating or incorrect overlapping. This seamless anchoring maintains structural coherence and visual clarity.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are balcony railings, interior furniture, and planters still visible and undistorted beneath the added textures and lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B prominently focuses on the modified elements like tentacles and textures, there is no clear indication that balcony railings, interior furniture, and planters are overtly visible or undistorted. It appears that the modifications may have overshadowed or altered the visibility of these components, leading to potential distortion beneath the added effects.",
