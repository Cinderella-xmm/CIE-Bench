      "question": "Does the kimono feature bold, clean outlines and uniformly flat color regions without gradient blending or photographic texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono has distinct outlines, indicative of artwork that involves line drawing techniques, and the colors are applied uniformly with no gradient blending, resembling traditional flat-color styles in art. This contrasts with Image A, where gradients and textures lend a photorealistic depth. The reasoning combines visual cues with knowledge of artistic styles like ukiyo-e.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms represented with simplified, stylized shapes and muted pink hues, avoiding photorealistic detail or irregular clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the cherry blossoms are rendered in flat, stylized formations with consistent color tones, signifying a departure from realistic representation to a more graphic style typical of woodblock print art. In contrast, Image A employs gradient blending and realistic clumping patterns for the blossoms. The conclusion draws on knowledge of artistic stylization methods.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the path stones and vertical poles display textured patterns such as hatching, stippling, or woodgrain that align with traditional woodblock printing techniques?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the path stones and poles exhibit simplified shapes and consistent color fills without evident textural techniques like hatching or woodgrain patterns. This is more aligned with graphic arts than traditional woodblock texturing. Image A, on the other hand, uses realistic textures and shadows. This answer relies on recognizing specific traditional printmaking techniques.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the figure's body proportionate and structurally sound, with no exaggerated limbs, distorted joints, or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a figure with standard body proportions, following a typical human anatomy structure in art, where limbs and joints are naturally aligned without exaggeration or distortion, consistent with traditional illustrations. Image A maintains similar proportions but uses depth-enhancing photographic style. This analysis is based on understanding proportion in visual art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the distant hills depicted as simplified, layered forms with flat colors and clear outlines, consistent with traditional ukiyo-e landscape conventions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays distant hills using flat colors and defined outlines, emulating the layered effect found in ukiyo-e style, known for its simplification of natural forms. Meanwhile, Image A applies gradients and depth perception techniques for realism. The conclusion integrates visual cues with educational knowledge of artistic history.",
