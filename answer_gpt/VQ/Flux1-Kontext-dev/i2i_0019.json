      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine of the elephant retain the natural grass-eating pose without introducing unnatural distortions or deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B captures the chibi-style, which typically emphasizes cuteness with exaggerated features such as a larger head and smaller body. The elephant is depicted holding grass with its trunk, similar to a natural pose an elephant would have. The proportions and posture maintain a whimsical representation without the inclusion of unnatural distortions inconsistent with the chibi style.",

        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figurine features smooth and simplified textures to enhance its cute appeal, which is common in toy designs.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
