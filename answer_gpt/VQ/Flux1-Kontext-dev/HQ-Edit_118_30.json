      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the trainâ€™s locomotive and carriages transformed into interlocking geometric blocks that maintain their original proportions and alignment along the track without visible distortions or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When observing Image B, the train, including the locomotive and carriages, appears as a cohesive illustrated puzzle design. This transformation did not alter the proportions or alignment along the track. The geometric transformation that typically fits into a themed puzzle is not evident since the puzzle pieces shown are separate from the train image, and the train itself does not show segmentation into puzzle pieces but instead maintains its visual integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the smoke above the train rendered as smooth, continuous swirling white forms that follow the natural trajectory of rising steam without jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows smoke that is smooth and continuous, resembling natural steam rising from a train. The texture is consistent without any notable jagged edges or artifact distortions. This representation maintains normal characteristics of smoke or steam both in shape and gradual dissipation towards the top, indicating a high level of visual continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all human figures at the station platform replaced by small, flat puzzle-shaped elements wearing vintage clothing, with no visible distortions in limbs or posture, and do they retain recognizable positions relative to benches and luggage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, human figures on the platform are visible in traditional poses and clothing, not replaced by puzzle-shaped elements. The figures maintain their standard posture and positions relative to benches and physical surroundings just as in the original scene without segmentation into puzzle pieces. People appear unchanged from their illustration in Image A, ensuring they remain identifiable and whole in their arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fields and hills in the background rendered as clearly defined geometric patterns (e.g., rectangles, triangles) that form a cohesive, interlocking design without gaps, overlapping errors, or abrupt texture changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fields and hills in the background of Image B preserve an illustratively rich, scenic style without transforming into geometric patterns or interlocking designs. They maintain a visually consistent landscape of fields separated into general sections by color and design rather than converting into clear geometric shapes. Hence, the image continues to reflect an artistically uninterrupted rural backdrop without exhibiting geometric segmentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene, including the train, tracks, station, and landscape, placed on a light wooden tabletop with visible wood grain and consistent lighting, and are there no floating elements or mismatched shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the entire scene, including the train and station, on a light wooden surface with wood grain visible. The puzzle is shown as a flat square on this tabletop, illuminated evenly without mismatched shadows or floating parts separate from the main image. The lighting is uniform, enhancing realism by showcasing shadows consistent with a tabletop viewing. This effectively consolidates the scenery into a plausible diorama or display where lighting and perspective along the surface meet standard expectations.",
