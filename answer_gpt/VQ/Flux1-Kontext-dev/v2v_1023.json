      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D characters retain natural proportions and avoid unnatural distortions in their facial features and body shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style characters, positioned at the bottom of the snow globe, appear to be stylized deliberately. Generally, chibi characters are known for their exaggerated features, such as larger heads compared to their bodies, which is a form of artistic expression. This stylization does not qualify as unnatural distortion, as it aligns with the common design style of chibi characters in animation or illustrations, suggesting that they are intentionally designed with exaggerated proportions while still adhering to chibi design norms.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe is seamlessly placed on the table, and the reflections and lighting match the ambient light of the room, giving it a cohesive integration within the living room setting. There are no apparent artifacts like mismatched lighting or inconsistent shadows that would suggest it is unnatural or edited improperly into the scene. This indicates a smooth and believable integration.",
