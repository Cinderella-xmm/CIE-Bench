    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the snow-capped peak exhibit a consistent, non-uniform glittering texture that mimics natural snow while avoiding blocky or artificial sparkles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the peak of Mount Fuji is covered with snow, presenting a textured surface that is consistent with the appearance of natural snow. The texture is non-uniform, which aligns with natural snow's behavior on varying terrain, and there are no blocky or synthetic sparkles visible on the snow surface. Thus, the rendering succeeds in mimicking how real snow appears on mountains.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree lines and grasslands along the base of the mountain rendered with natural variation in color and density, without repeating brush-like strokes or artificial line artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, along the base of the mountain, the trees are depicted with variations in color and density that are typical in natural environments. The grasslands and trees do not exhibit uniform, brush-like strokes or repetitive artificial patterns, suggesting a realistic rendering of the terrain similar to how foliage appears in natural settings.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lake surface uniformly reflective with no visible distortion, warping, or artificial shine that breaks the continuity of the mountain's reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lake in Image B shows a reflection of the mountain that is consistent and smooth across the surface. The reflection does not have visible distortions, warping, or any artificial shine that disrupts continuity. The reflection is painted naturally, retaining the realism of how reflections appear on calm water.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the chalet figurines positioned at ground level along the shoreline with proper scale and shadow alignment, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chalet figurines along the shoreline are correctly scaled in relation to each other and the environment, suggesting proper positioning at ground level. The shadows cast by these chalets are aligned with the light source present in the scene, maintaining consistency in shadow direction and subtlety.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, distortions, or artificial reflections around the perimeter of the scene that suggest an unnatural glass boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does suggest a boundary made of glass based on the clear container-like surroundings depicted. While this framing does introduce an artificiality regarding the scene boundary, no seams, distortions, or reflections on the glass boundary itself disrupt the depiction of the enclosed scene, making the glass visible but not unnatural in the context of this display.",
