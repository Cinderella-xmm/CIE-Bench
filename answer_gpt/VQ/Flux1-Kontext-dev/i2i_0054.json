      "question": "Does the newly added matte gray background appear uniform and free of any distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a solid matte gray which appears smooth and consistent, without any noticeable patterns, distortions, or unnatural textures. The uniform appearance suggests that it was intentionally made to highlight the subject, i.e., the elephant, without any distractions.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the absence of shadows make the elephant appear unnaturally floating or disconnected from the surface beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant lacks any visible shadow on the matte gray background. Typically, shadows on the ground beneath an object indicate its position relative to the surface. Without this shadow, the elephant seems to be disconnected or floating above the background, as there is no visual cue to suggest contact or grounding.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fine details and textures on the elephant's skin preserved without noticeable loss after the background change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the elephant with detailed skin textures, including wrinkles and folds, which are clearly visible and distinct. Despite the change to a uniform matte gray background, these details remain intact and preserved, suggesting that the quality of the elephant's skin details has not noticeably degraded.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the absence of banana shape and metal stand curves, which were not part of the original elephant image, result in any unnatural artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Since the question refers to elements not part of the original image, we assess that in Image B, the presence of a metal object (potentially a hook) and a rock-like surface have been replaced or edited out. This does not create any other unnatural artifacts or inconsistencies in Image B because the focus remains on the elephant without these previously present objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the elephant retain its correct proportions and physical rationality relative to the new matte gray background, avoiding any visual distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant appears to maintain consistent proportions, with no apparent stretching or shrinking that would indicate distortion. The elephant's features like its body, ears, trunk, and legs appear normally proportioned, and though the background has changed to matte gray, it does not imply any distortion of the elephant itself.",
