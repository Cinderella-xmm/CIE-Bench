      "question": "Does the golden scepter in the man's right hand have a smooth, reflective metallic surface that matches the lighting conditions without exhibiting unnatural texture artifacts or inconsistent highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scepter displayed in the edited image has a golden hue that is consistent with its surrounding lighting conditions, giving it a reflective quality typical of metal. The visual cues indicate smooth contours and consistent highlights that suggest a natural metallic surface lacking texture artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pastel-colored fabrics of the man’s coat, vest, trousers, and shirt rendered with visible texture and depth, maintaining natural folds and shadows without appearing flat or washed out?",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the man’s clothing with distinct fabric textures, especially noticeable in the knitted vest and patterned coat. These garments exhibit natural folds with appropriate shading, providing a three-dimensional and life-like appearance instead of flatness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cobblestones beneath the man’s feet form a continuous, evenly spaced pattern with natural irregularities and consistent shading, avoiding broken or misaligned stones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cobblestones in the edited image are depicted with a consistent pattern and spacing, which is crucial for visual continuity. They show natural irregularities but maintain a structured formation, without noticeable misalignment or shading inconsistencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the detachable note sections placed along the outer edges of the image without overlapping the man or background architecture, and do they have clean, uniform borders resembling paper cutouts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The note sections on the image are positioned around the perimeter, distinctly separated from the central figure and architecture, ensuring no overlap. Their edges are clean and uniform, resembling paper cutouts with clear borders.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the man’s right hand gripping the scepter show five clearly defined fingers with natural joint angles and no deformation, while the left hand in the pocket maintains a relaxed, anatomically accurate pose?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The man’s right hand in the edited image shows fingers gripping the scepter with natural anatomy, and the angles appear realistic. The left hand, although partially obscured in the pocket, maintains a pose that suggests anatomical correctness without apparent deformation.",
