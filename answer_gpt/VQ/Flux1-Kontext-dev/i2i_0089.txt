    "Question": "Q1: Does the kitten's body appear structurally consistent without any unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten's body looks properly proportioned and consistent. The limbs, body, and tail maintain natural shapes and positions. Structurally, the kitten appears well-formed, with no visible distortions or artifacts, suggesting the application of a 3D effect did not compromise its natural form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the fur details around the kitten’s face natural and free from any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "The fur around the kitten’s face in Image B appears rich in texture, with detailed and realistic fur patterns visible. There are no visible unnatural textures or loss of detail in the fur; it maintains its natural look, indicative of a high-quality image with a successful editing process.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the kitten's position and perspective accurately simulate a 3D jumps-out effect without breaking its geometric shapes or distorting its proportions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten is positioned in a way that suggests movement, as it appears to be emerging from the blanket. The perspective and position are consistent with the intended 3D jumps-out effect, maintaining the geometric shapes and proportions of the kitten without distortion, indicating an effective use of the effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the material properties of the blue blanket around the kitten look natural, supporting the 3D illusion without introducing any artificial artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The blue blanket in Image B retains a natural appearance with visible textures, folds, and shadows that support the 3D effect. The material looks consistent with how a soft blanket would appear in reality, thus ensuring the effect does not introduce any artificial artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the kitten's paws shaped naturally, consistently placed, and free from any distortion or unrealistic deformations after applying the 3D effect?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten's paws are well-shaped and naturally positioned, as expected in the context of its pose. The paws maintain consistency with realistic anatomy and show no signs of distortion or unrealistic deformation, suggesting the 3D effect is applied successfully.",
    "answer": "Yes"
