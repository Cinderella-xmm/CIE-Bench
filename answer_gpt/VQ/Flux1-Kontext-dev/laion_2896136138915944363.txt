    "Question": "Q1: Does the sandpiper's body maintain correct proportions and natural posture, with wings aligned to the torso and legs positioned symmetrically beneath the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sandpiper illustration appears well-proportioned with its wings appropriately aligned to the torso, and the legs are symmetrically positioned beneath the body, supporting a natural posture. This is consistent with how sandpipers are typically depicted in illustrations and wildlife photography. Thus, the proportions and alignment within the illustration seem accurate.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the textures on the packaging surface uniform in pattern and color, with no repeating tiles, sharp edges, or unnatural transitions between areas?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the packaging surface has a consistent design, with uniform textures and patterns. The sand and wave patterns blend smoothly into each other. No sharp edges or unnatural transitions are apparent in the design, and the color scheme is cohesive.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the text 'Shoreline Explorer Set' fully visible, correctly aligned, and rendered with smooth edges without jagged lines or transparency artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the text 'Shoreline Explorer Set' is not present or fully visible; instead, it seems that different text is shown on the packaging ('ECCHWAUMBIRR KY BLOLERER'). This indicates that the specific text in question is not correctly aligned or rendered in the visible parts of the image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the wave patterns on the flat bottom of the packaging form continuous, flowing curves without gaps, overlaps, or angular distortions?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows wave patterns at the bottom part of the packaging. These patterns appear smooth and continuous without any gaps or overlaps. The curves do not exhibit angular distortions, providing a natural depiction of waves on packaging.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the binocular-shaped cut-out window properly shaped with smooth contours, and does it show a clear, non-distorted view of internal kit components without floating or misplaced objects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the binocular-shaped cut-out window is clearly defined with smooth contours, and it reveals what appears to be well-positioned binoculars inside the packaging window without distortion or misplacement. No floating or awkwardly placed objects are visible within the cut-out frame.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a smooth, continuous transition between the sandpiper illustration and the surrounding packaging elements, with no visible outlines, shadows, or color discontinuities?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sandpiper illustration is integrated seamlessly with the rest of the packaging design. There are no clear outlines or shadows that disrupt the transition from the illustration to surrounding elements. The colors are continuous and coherent, supporting a unified aesthetic across the packaging.",
    "answer": "Yes"
