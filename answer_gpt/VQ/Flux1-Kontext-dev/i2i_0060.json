    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the elements of the image, such as the elephant and its environment, unaltered and maintain their original natural appearance without any artifacts introduced in the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image (B), it does not feature an elephant and its natural environment but rather showcases food placed on a plate. Thus, significant alterations have been made to the original natural scene and elements in Image A.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the elements within the image appear natural and consistent with the original, such as the roughness of the elephantâ€™s skin and the details of the hay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the materials and textures correspond to culinary elements like a piece of meat and sauces rather than an elephant's skin and hay. These elements are consistent with a food setting rather than the natural environment seen in Image A, indicating a deviation from the original materials.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical features of the elephant and its surroundings, like the hay bale and enclosure, depicted accurately and without unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (B) features a plate of food instead of the elephant and its natural surroundings. This represents a change in proportions and physical features, moving away from any accurate depiction of the original scene's natural elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details, such as the subtle lines and wrinkles on the elephant's skin and the strands of hay, been preserved without any degradation or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no presence of an elephant's skin or strands of hay; instead, it is a plate of food about its presentation and textures unrelated to the original scene's fine details. Hence, the original textures and details are not preserved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition of the image, including the placement of the elephant, the hay bale, and the enclosure, maintain visual credibility and alignment with the expected scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is composed entirely differently compared to the expected scene in Image A with its elephant and environment. The composition here is of a culinary setting, which does not align with or maintain the expected natural scene from the original image.",
