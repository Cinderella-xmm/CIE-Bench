      "question": "Does the miniature beach and surfer figure inside the snow globe appear structurally consistent and visually credible compared to the original beach scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beach scene inside the snow globe maintains structural consistency with the original beach scene from Image A. Both images depict a surfer preparing a surfboard under a similar setting sun. The snow globe in Image B encapsulates a miniature version of this scene, which retains the original's essential elements such as lighting, ocean horizon, and the position of the surfer. This consistency ensures that the scene looks visually credible and not artificial compared to the original.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the hands of the chibi-style 3D surfer figure free of unnatural textures and maintain the correct number of fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfer's hands are visible within the snow globe. My world knowledge suggests that a human hand typically has five fingers, and any deviations would look unnatural. The hands of the surfer in the snow globe appear proportionate and maintain the correct number of fingers. There are no unnatural textures that might suggest an inconsistency with a lifelike appearance.",

      "question": "Does the soft golden light and sparkles scattered around the snow globe create a natural and plausible warm atmosphere without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe emits a golden glow resembling a sunset, consistent with the light source's direction and intensity of the beach scene inside it. The sparkles around the globe suggest a magical touch, fitting the snow globe's theme without creating visual disturbances or artifacts. The warm light complements the fireplace glow, creating a cohesive and pleasant atmosphere.",

      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the miniature surfer figure and surfboard remain intact and undistorted within the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In evaluating Image B, the surfer figure and surfboard inside the snow globe maintain their shapes, showing no signs of distortion or warping. The positioning and orientation of the surfer and surfboard appear consistent, as expected in a typical snow globe scene. Their structural integrity suggests a well-executed image composition.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the placement of the snow globe on the wooden shelf near the fireplace visually credible and proportionally realistic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the snow globe placed on a wooden shelf near a fireplace. The scale of the snow globe relative to other objects like the fireplace and the hand offering perspective suggests a believable proportion in the scene. The weight and size appear suitable for a shelf, enhancing the realism and providing a plausible setup for the observer.",
