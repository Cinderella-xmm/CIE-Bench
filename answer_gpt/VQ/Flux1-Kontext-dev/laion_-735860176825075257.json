      "question": "Are the edges of the rooflines, gables, and timber framing sharply defined and angular without rounded or blurred transitions that contradict the paper-cut style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the style appears to imitate a paper-cut or graphic style, characterized by sharp lines and distinct separations between colors. The edges of rooflines, gables, and timber framing are observed to have clear, angular and sharply defined lines, without any rounded or blurred transitions. This aligns with the common characteristics of a paper-cut style, which emphasizes precision and crisp edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold foil accents on the window frames and flower box edges appear uniformly applied with consistent reflectivity and no pixelated or smudged textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there doesn't appear to be visible gold foil accents on the window frames and flower box edges when considering the visual representation. The image portrays a stylized art form, likely devoid of any real reflective textures such as gold foil that would show consistent reflective properties. Typically, gold foil in an image would capture attention with its metallic gleam, which is not evident here. Thus, this indicates no application of such elements, suggesting they are absent or not distinctly represented.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the crimson color of the entrance awning evenly distributed and consistent with the lighting direction, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entrance awning is depicted with a bold crimson color, common in stylized renderings like this one. The color appears evenly applied across the surface of the awning without noticeable patches or blotches that indicate abrupt shifts. The lighting seems consistent with the overall image's lighting direction, with no unnatural shadowing that conflicts with the coherent style of the image. This consistency with lighting is essential in high-quality digital renderings.",

      "question": "Are the geometric arch borders cleanly aligned with the edges of the image and do they not overlap or distort any part of the building's structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the geometric arch borders on the structure maintain the architectural integrity and alignment seen in the stylized representation. They do not appear to interrupt or distort the intersection areas or other elements of the structure. This is indicative of professional editing, where maintaining boundaries ensures the building's design features are respected.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edge of the image appear clean and continuous without visible clipping, jagged lines, or missing pixels that suggest improper trimming or rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the edges of the image seem smooth and properly rendered without evidence of errors like clipping, jagged lines, or missing pixels. This quality indicates meticulous attention to digital presentation, ensuring the borders are flush and consistent with an artistic rendering style, where cleanliness and continuity are essential for visual appeal.",
