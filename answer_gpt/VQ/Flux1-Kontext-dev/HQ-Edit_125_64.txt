    "Question": "Q1: Is the sun disc replacing the Sphinx’s head seamlessly integrated with the neck and body, showing no jagged edges or misaligned contours?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the sun disc atop the Sphinx appears smoothly integrated with the neck and body. The edges of the disc blend naturally with the Sphinx structure without any visible jagged edges or noticeable misalignment. The disc is positioned symmetrically, and its circular shape maintains a natural continuity with the curves of the Sphinx's outline. This indicates a careful editing technique that ensures smoothness and seamless integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the golden wings extend symmetrically from the sides of the Sphinx’s body with smooth, continuous surfaces and natural curvature?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the golden wings are attached to the Sphinx's sides. They appear even and symmetric, with smooth surfaces and curves that follow an anatomically plausible path consistent with wing structures. The wings' feathers are aligned in an orderly fashion, exhibiting a realistic curvature flowing naturally from the Sphinx’s body. There’s visual symmetry which suggests intentional and precise editing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the sand flows on the limbs continuous and gravity-consistent, without abrupt breaks or floating segments?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the sand flows on the Sphinx's limbs appear visually consistent with the effects of gravity, beginning at the top and falling naturally along the surface without any unexplained gaps or floating areas. The flow seems smooth and follows the shape of the limbs seamlessly, suggesting a realistic depiction of gravity’s effects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ankhs on the paws correctly shaped, properly scaled, and emitting a soft, localized glow without distorting adjacent textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ankhs depicted on the Sphinx's paws are accurately shaped, maintaining the traditional Egyptian cross with a loop shape. They are scaled appropriately to the paw size, and the localized glow emitted by them does not interfere with or distort surrounding textures. The glow is soft, maintaining a natural appearance amidst the overall image composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the entire edited figure exhibit consistent lighting and shading across all added elements, with no visible seams or texture mismatches?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays consistent lighting and shading across the entire Sphinx figure, including the head, wings, and the body. The added elements, such as the sun disc and wings, show cohesive shadowing matching the sunset illumination, ensuring a harmonious visual scene. There are no visible texture mismatches, and the transitions between original and edited areas are effectively seamless, indicating a smoothly executed edit throughout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
