      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the hammer's handle display a uniform deep blue enamel surface with no visible cracks, rough patches, or color variations, and does the head show realistic metallic sheen with consistent reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hammer's handle in Image B is designed with a uniform deep blue enamel surface. Based on the visual cues, the surface appears smooth and intact, indicating no cracks or rough patches. The handle lacks color variations, maintaining a consistent appearance. The hammerhead, reflecting typical metallic properties, shows realistic reflections and sheen, which aligns with a polished metallic surface. World knowledge about enamel coatings and metal surfaces helps judge the consistency and realism in the visual depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the chisel, file, wrench, and pliers retain their original shapes and proportions, with smooth, reflective enamel surfaces and no warped edges, missing details, or inconsistent material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chisel, file, wrench, and pliers each exhibit a design that stays true to their basic function, maintaining the expected shapes and proportions. The surfaces are presented with a smooth, reflective enamel finish, and visual cues confirm the absence of warped edges, missing details, or inconsistent material transitions, indicating a coherent depiction. World knowledge aids in understanding the typical designs and expected visual features of these tools.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the enamel shavings shaped into natural-looking curls with varied thickness and smooth, glossy surfaces, avoiding flat or rigid appearances and maintaining fine detail along the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the enamel shavings with realistic curls, suggesting variability in thickness and a glossy finish that aligns with natural material behaviors when shaved or curled. The shavings display well-defined edges with noticeable fine detail, contributing to a believable appearance. World knowledge on how materials like enamel react under manipulation supports the analysis.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the linen fabric background show a natural weave texture with soft folds and slight color variation, and does it provide a visually coherent base for the enamel tools without appearing artificial or overly smooth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric background appears to mimic linen weave patterns, showing implied texture. Subtle folds and slight color variations provide depth, supporting a more natural appearance. The fabric serves as a coherent base for the tools, aligning with the visual narrative without appearing artificial or overly smooth, thanks to inherent understanding of fabric properties.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows and highlights on the enamel tools consistent with a single light source and the reflective nature of enamel, and do all tools rest naturally on the fabric without gaps, floating effects, or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows and highlights on the enamel tools follow consistent direction and intensity, indicative of illumination from a single light source. The reflective enamel surfaces display coherent light behavior. Each tool is positioned naturally upon the fabric, exhibiting resting positions without visible gaps or floating effects, suggesting alignment with this lighting. Common knowledge regarding reflective materials and light behavior assists in this evaluation.",
