      "question": "Are the curls in the hair rendered with consistent marble texture, showing natural variations in depth and surface detail without visible artifacts such as blurring, flattening, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is depicted with a consistent marble texture that highlights the intricate detailing characteristic of marble sculptures. The curls appear well-defined, with appropriate depth and shadowing that one would expect from a high-quality marble render. There is no visible blurring or flattening, indicating that the texture and details have been applied coherently. This is similar to classical marble statues where variations in the material naturally result in variations in depth and surface detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ornamental carvings on the neck and shoulders maintain anatomical alignment with the musculature and have continuous, coherent shapes without gaps, misaligned edges, or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental carvings on the neck and shoulders are seamlessly integrated with the musculature, following the natural contours and lines of the figure. The carvings display continuous and coherent shapes, showing no signs of gaps or misaligned edges. The details are in alignment with the artistic style of marble sculpture, where there is an emphasis on harmony and continuity between ornamentation and anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the angelic figures in the background depicted with clear outlines, proper proportions, and consistent depth relative to the central figure, without appearing flat, distorted, or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the angelic figures in the background are rendered with clear outlines and maintain proper proportions, contributing to the overall harmony of the composition. They are positioned to provide depth relative to the central figure, avoiding a flat or distorted appearance. This reflects the techniques used in relief sculptures, where the depth and detail convey a sense of three-dimensionality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire image uniformly rendered in a monochrome palette with smooth gradients and no abrupt transitions between light and dark areas that suggest incomplete color conversion or artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is portrayed in a uniform monochrome palette, predominantly in white, which is typical of marble sculpture. The gradients are smooth, without any abrupt transitions between light and dark areas that might indicate incomplete color conversion or visual artifacts. The consistent use of shading enhances the depth and texture, akin to classical monochromatic renditions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do both hands display exactly five fingers each with natural joint articulation and realistic proportions, without fused digits, elongated limbs, or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands are sculpted to show exactly five fingers each, with natural joint articulation and realistic proportions. There are no indications of fused digits, elongated limbs, or unnatural bending. This attention to anatomical accuracy is consistent with classical sculpture where hands are often rendered with careful consideration of form and movement.",
