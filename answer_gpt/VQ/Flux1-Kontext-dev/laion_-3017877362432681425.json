      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the gullwing doors reshaped into raised, rounded button-like structures symmetrically placed on both sides of the car, with smooth transitions from the body and no visible warping or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gullwing doors appear unchanged and are not reshaped into raised, rounded button-like structures. They maintain their original form and functionality with the distinct upward-opening style typical of Mercedes vehicles. There are no modifications to suggest the doors are altered in such a manner. Based on visual inspection and world knowledge of car design, the description does not match the current state.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the front grille redesigned into a four-segment cross-shaped directional pad with evenly spaced and aligned sections, centered beneath the Mercedes emblem, and free from overlapping or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grille retains its original Mercedes design featuring horizontal and vertical slats with the central Mercedes emblem. There is no transformation into a directional pad or cross shape. The design is consistent with standard vehicle grilles and does not show any modification as such described. Based on visual cues and world knowledge, the grille remains unaltered in this aspect.",

      "question": "Does the entire exterior surface exhibit consistent metallic red coloring with smooth gloss highlights that follow the curvature of the body and reflect ambient light realistically without abrupt transitions or flat areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car retains a consistent metallic red color throughout its exterior. The gloss highlights appear natural, following the curves of the car, and the reflection of ambient light is realistic, maintaining an even finish. The detailed inspection shows no abrupt color transitions or flat, unreflective spots, aligning with world knowledge about car paint and finish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a detailed emblem located on the dashboard area, resembling a central control button, with clear lines and shading that match the surrounding interior materials and do not appear displaced or blurry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image primarily focuses on the exterior of the car, and the interior, including the dashboard area, is not clearly visible or emphasized. Hence, there is insufficient visual reference to assess the presence or detail of such an emblem on the dashboard as described. Based on world knowledge, without detailed visual evidence, this aspect is not confirmed in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a branded logo placed centrally on the hood, shaped like a circular control element with defined edges and consistent depth, and aligned with the car’s longitudinal axis without tilting or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the hood of the car displaying the traditional Mercedes emblem and logo. There is an additional emblem present, which seems to resemble a design element added on the hood. However, it does have defined edges and appears mostly aligned with the car’s axis, without distortion. This added element aligns with the description given based on visual cues.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all edited components (shoulder buttons, D-pad grille, hood logo) fully attached to the car body with no floating parts, misaligned joints, or unnatural bends in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a significant edit is the hood's emblem addition. This emblem appears well integrated into the car’s design without noticeable misalignments. However, other components, such as shoulder buttons or a D-pad grille, are not present or recognizable as described, suggesting that not all stated modifications exist. Thus, thorough world knowledge and visual analysis conclude revisions may appear consistent, not all described elements exist.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, repeated patterns, or unnatural reflections at the boundaries of edited regions (e.g., door edges, grille perimeter, hood logo)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the edges of different components such as the hood emblem and door lines show proper alignment and smooth transitions without visible artifacts like jagged lines or repeated patterns. Reflections and highlights appear natural and cohesive with the car's overall aesthetics. Therefore, based on visual evidence, there are no discernible editing artifacts present.",
