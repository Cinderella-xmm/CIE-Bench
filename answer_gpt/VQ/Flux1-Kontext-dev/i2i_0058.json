      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transition between the cow's original body and the new anthropomorphic features of the knight-themed bull maintain a natural appearance without noticeable artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bull is depicted as a humanoid knight with armor. The integration appears smooth, with the armor covering the body naturally and forming a cohesive whole. Upon visual inspection, there are no glaring inconsistencies or unnatural transitions visible between the anthropomorphic features and the rest of the body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the silver metal armor and cape seamlessly integrated onto the bull without any unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor and cape appear cleanly rendered on the anthropomorphic bull in Image B. The textures of the metal armor look reflective and three-dimensional, consistent with real metal, and the cape hangs in a visually plausible manner. The overall integration of these elements onto the figure is done without noticeable distortions or mismatched textures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the medieval forest path background align naturally with the anthropomorphic bull in terms of lighting and perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting on the knight-themed bull matches the surrounding environment. The shadowing on the bull aligns well with the light source suggestions from the forest background, supporting a cohesive lighting integration. The perspective places the figure naturally within the given path, contributing to a believable scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical movements of the anthropomorphic bull remain coherent with the rightward walking pose originally depicted by the cow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the bull is depicted in a humanoid form walking forward. The resulting proportions seem balanced and anatomically plausible in this new form. While the quadrupedal movement of the cow from Image A is not directly comparable due to the transformation into a bipedal figure, the movement appears coherent with natural bipedal mechanics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the brushstrokes in the realistic oil painting style enhance the overall visual plausibility of the anthropomorphic bull, armor, cape, and medieval forest background without appearing overly stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a realistic oil painting style that enhances the depiction of the bull, its armor, and the forest environment. The use of brushstrokes gives a texture that does not become distracting or overly stylized, blending the various elements into a coherent visual narrative that still maintains a realistic appearance.",
