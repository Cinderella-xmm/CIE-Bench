      "question": "Does the 3D voxel-style model of the mouse retain a natural texture similar to the original mouse's fur without any obvious unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D voxel-style model of the mouse is constructed from large pixel-like blocks, typical of voxel art. This style does not attempt to capture the intricate, fluffy texture of the original mouse's fur, evident in Image A, which displays a natural and fine texture characteristic of animal fur. The visual representation of fur in Image B is abstracted into blocky shapes, deviating significantly from a natural appearance, which is an intentional stylistic choice in voxel art. Hence, using world knowledge about voxel art and its differences from photorealistic styles, the texture of the mouse in Image B does not retain a natural texture similar to that in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the mouse's body parts in the 3D voxel-style model consistent with its original form, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D voxel-style model aims to represent the mouse in a stylized way using larger geometric blocks, which might slightly alter the appearance but generally retains the correct proportions and anatomy resembling the real mouse in Image A. The body parts, such as ears, legs, and the body shape, appear proportionally consistent with what the real mouse would look like, despite being simplified into blocky forms. This consistency can be understood by recognizing the purpose of voxel rendering to render recognizable forms despite their abstraction.",

      "question": "Do the edges and surfaces of the 3D voxel-style mouse model appear smooth and coherent, without any jagged or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D voxel-style mouse is designed with clean, sharp edges typical of voxel art. The segmentations are coherent and intentionally pixilated but without any unintended jagged or broken appearances - the geometry of the voxels is consistent, forming a uniform surface. This design aims to make the appearance clear and organized, contrasted with the smooth natural curves in Image A. Based on the characteristics of voxel art, the edges are intentionally sharp rather than jagged.",

      "question": "Does the interaction between the 3D voxel-style mouse model and the smartphone look plausible and realistic, without any unnatural positioning or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the voxel-style mouse is positioned in close proximity to the smartphone, similar to Image A. The positioning appears natural as both objects occupy the same plane of the wooden surface as seen in Image A. Voxel art often lacks fine detail in shadows, but this is consistent across both images without distorting the spatial relationship significantly. Therefore, when analyzing spatial positioning and basic shadow alignment based on common scenarios, the interaction maintains a plausible realism.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the mouse's features, such as whiskers and eyes, preserved in the 3D voxel-style model without any loss or degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the eyes of the 3D voxel-style mouse are represented distinctly, the whiskers are omitted, which constitutes a loss of detail compared to Image A. Voxel art simplifies features into block-shaped representations and often sacrifices intricate details like thin whiskers to maintain simplicity. The eyes are captured in a stylized form but lack the full refinement seen in Image A, reflecting a choice inherent in voxel art. Thus, the detailing, especially finer elements like whiskers, is indeed degraded despite retaining recognizable features.",
