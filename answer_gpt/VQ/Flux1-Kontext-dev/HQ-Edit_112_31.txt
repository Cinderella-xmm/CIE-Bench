    "Question": "Q1: Is the horseâ€™s head enlarged proportionally so that facial features like the eyes and muzzle remain clearly defined and undistorted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the plush horse has a large head relative to its body size, which is a common feature of chibi-style designs where proportions are exaggerated for cuteness. The facial features such as the eyes and muzzle are clearly defined and maintain proportionality without distortion. This is characteristic of plush toys designed with exaggerated proportions to enhance appeal, particularly in chibi aesthetics where clarity of facial features is crucial despite proportional exaggeration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the body of the plush horse display a consistent fabric texture with soft, non-reflective surfaces and no abrupt transitions between color regions?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a plush horse where the body exhibits a consistent fabric texture typical of soft toys. The materials appear non-reflective and have smooth transitions between the color regions, maintaining the fabric texture without any abrupt changes. This consistency is consistent with the characteristic of manufactured plush toys which are designed to have cohesive fabric textures and color integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the eyes and mouth of the plush horse depicted with visible stitching patterns and raised texture consistent with embroidery?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows eyes that are non-stitched and lack the texture of embroidery. Instead, they appear to be smooth and shiny, likely made from plastic or a glossy fabric consistent with typical plush toy designs. The mouth also lacks any visible stitching pattern or raised texture, suggesting a different method of construction rather than embroidered details, which are common in plush toys where eyes are frequently represented with non-embroidered techniques.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the legs of the plush horse appear short and thick with smooth, rounded shapes and no distorted or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the legs of the plush horse are depicted as short and thick, which suits the chibi-style design aesthetic commonly used for plush toys. These legs have smooth, rounded shapes and do not show any signs of distortion or broken geometry, typical of the structured yet simplistic characteristic of plush toys where smoothness and rounded edges are prioritized for visual appeal and tactile experience.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the dandelions in the foreground composed of flat, circular felt-like discs on straight stems, lacking naturalistic detail or depth?",
    "explanation": "Image B features flowers that resemble daisies rather than dandelions. These daisies have flat, circular petals which could be felt-like, attached to straight stems. The design lacks naturalistic details and depth, adhering to a simplified representation likely used for crafting or toy scenes, where a stylized approach gives importance to the basic shape and color.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the forest background rendered as a flat, untextured plane with no depth cues such as overlapping trees or atmospheric perspective?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a boxed diorama where the background includes a representation of trees. This background appears flat with limited texture and lacks depth cues such as overlapping elements or atmospheric perspective. This suggests a straightforward and simplified representation, customary in toy boxes or display cases where backgrounds are often designed to suggest a scene without detailed depth perception.",
    "answer": "Yes"
