      "question": "Is the glass dome enclosing the lantern transparent and smooth, with no visible distortions, cracks, or unnatural refraction patterns that disrupt the perception of depth or clarity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome around the lantern appears to be transparent and smooth. There are no visible distortions, cracks, or unnatural refraction patterns that would suggest imperfections or interference with visual clarity. The dome maintains a clear perception of depth, allowing for a consistent view of the elements enclosed within.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scaled-down ceramic street pavements composed of clearly defined, uniformly sized tiles with accurate color transitions and no blurred or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pavement in Image B consists of precisely defined, uniformly sized tiles. The colors transition smoothly from one tile to another, maintaining sharp and uninterrupted edges. This suggests accurate rendering without any blurriness or misalignment that would detract from the realism of the miniature ceramic setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the textile merchants and their fabric canopies proportionally small compared to the lantern, with realistic shapes and textures that do not appear stretched, duplicated, or unnaturally fused with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textile merchants and their fabric canopies are depicted in a miniature scale appropriate to the lantern's size, maintaining realistic proportions. Their shapes and textures appear natural with no signs of distortion, duplication, or blending unnaturally with other elements within the scene. This contributes to the consistency and realism of the miniature setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the palm trees have properly shaped fronds, rooted bases, and consistent shadows that align with the light source from the lantern, without appearing flat or detached from the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm trees in Image B are depicted with well-shaped fronds and rooted bases. Their shadows align consistently with the light emitted from the lantern, maintaining a realistic interplay of light and shadow. The trees do not appear flat or detached from the ground, contributing to the cohesive and lifelike portrayal of the miniature environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base of the dome feature a textured, weathered surface with subtle variations in tone and depth, free from uniform patterns or digital artifacts that suggest over-processing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the dome in Image B displays a textured and weathered appearance, featuring subtle variations in tone and depth. These aspects contribute to its realistic portrayal, free from uniform patterns or digital artifacts that might imply over-processing. The natural variances enhance the authenticity of the miniature setting.",
