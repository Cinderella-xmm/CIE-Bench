        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo is placed prominently on a flat surface inside the refrigerator.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the custom label on the top shelf situated near a jar and a bowl. The placement is discreet and does not interfere with the form or structure of nearby objects, demonstrating consistency with the spatial arrangement of items on the shelf. This suggests careful consideration of the positioning to avoid any unintended distortion of surrounding elements.",

      "question": "Are the texture and details around the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label consistent with the rest of the refrigerator's surface, avoiding any noticeable loss or alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reflects that the texture and color fidelity of the surface containing the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo matches that of the rest of the refrigerator interior. There isn't a discrepancy in surface detailing or texture, implying that the editing process preserved the natural consistency of the appliance's material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label maintain appropriate scaling relative to their surrounding elements, appearing neither too large nor too small?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo has been sized to fit a specific area within the refrigerator, appearing proportionate with nearby items and the space dedicated to it. Similarly, the custom label is scaled appropriately with reference to its designated spot on the top shelf. Thus, both elements blend seamlessly into their respective areas without appearing disproportionate.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting and shadowing on the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label correspond logically to the light source, contributing to a natural and authentic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and custom label under the light source from inside the refrigerator, allowing both to exhibit realistic lighting and shadow effects. The light reflects naturally over these edits, consistent with how light is cast across other items within the refrigerator, contributing to authentic incorporation.",
