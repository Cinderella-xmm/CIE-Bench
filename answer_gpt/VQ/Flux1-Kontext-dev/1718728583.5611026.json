      "question": "Does the robot's body exhibit smooth, continuous chrome-like surfaces without visible texture breaks or inconsistent material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot body is presented with polished, chrome-like surfaces that show consistent reflection and uniformity. These surfaces appear smooth without visible seams or abrupt transitions indicative of different materials. This suggests advanced manufacturing or design techniques, aligning with the aesthetic of a futuristic robot, and requires a perception of high-tech coherence in visual design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the flamingos rendered as cohesive geometric shapes with consistent edges and proportions, without fragmented or disconnected components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flamingos are designed in a uniform and cohesive manner. Their bodies, necks, and legs display consistent geometric proportions, smoothly curved lines, and connected components. This uniformity maintains visual clarity and realistic representation, representing the flamingos in an aesthetically pleasing and accurate manner.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the palm trees and rocks in the background have angular, stylized forms that maintain consistent perspective and spatial relationships without appearing disjointed or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features palm trees and rocks designed with angular, stylized forms that maintain logical perspective and spatial relationships. These elements appear grounded, connected to the sandy beach environment and maintaining consistent visual direction and proportion relative to each other.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the color palette across the entire scene consistently muted and pastel-toned, with no areas exhibiting sudden or jarring color deviations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B is consistent and pastel-toned, giving the scene a soft and muted atmosphere. There are no areas within the image where sudden or striking color changes occur, thereby supporting a harmonious and tranquil visual aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the robot's hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural curvature and spacing, and no extra or malformed digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot's hands in Image B display exactly five fingers coordinated with natural curvature and spacing akin to a human hand. The digits do not appear malformed or extra, demonstrating meticulous design mimicking organic structure and function in robotics.",
