    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the vertical towers now resemble tree limbs with natural bark texture and leaf coverage, without visible seams or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical towers in the background retain their original form as bridge structures and do not resemble tree limbs with natural bark texture or leaf coverage. They exhibit the same geometric design as seen in traditional bridge architecture and stand distinguished from the surrounding forest environment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arches now formed into a continuous ribcage structure with natural curvature and spacing, free from broken or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B continues to display the originally structured bridge arches, which maintain their man-made geometric design rather than transforming into a ribcage structure. The arches do not exhibit natural curvature typical of anatomical ribcages, maintaining their bridge-like appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the suspension cables been replaced with vine-like tendrils that show natural growth patterns, such as twisting or clinging, and do they blend with the forest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suspension cables of the bridge are still visible as traditional cables. These do not exhibit the characteristics of vines, such as twisting or clinging, and they clearly stand out from the forest environment rather than blending into it.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bridgeâ€™s foundations now consist of moss-covered roots extending into the stream, with natural branching and tapering, rather than solid stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B still shows solid stone foundations rather than any root-like structure or foundation that would appear as naturally moss-covered and extending into the stream. These foundations are part of the engineered bridge structure and do not mimic natural roots.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a bark-textured head structure with two glowing emerald eyes positioned at the top of the bridge, with the glow confined and not causing light bleed or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no presence of a bark-textured head structure with glowing eyes in Image B. The bridge maintains its original structural integrity without additional surreal or mythical elements added, such as glowing features on its towers.",
