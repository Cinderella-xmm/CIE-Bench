    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features on the frame near the handlebars seamlessly integrated with the red surface, showing no visible seams, texture mismatch, or color artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B has transformed the bike into a cartoon-like representation, but noticeably does not feature any facial features on the frame near the handlebars. Without such elements present, the notion of integration with the surface, texture mismatch, or color artifacts becomes irrelevant as there is no applicable context related to facial features in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cartoon limbs extend from the hub centers without distorting the wheel rims, spokes, or hub components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are stylistic enhancements with colorful graphics in the vicinity of the hub centers, but they resemble decorative patterns rather than 'cartoon limbs.' These added patterns do not interfere with the structural integrity of the wheel rims, spokes, or hub components, maintaining their traditional appearance as seen in Image A, ensuring no distortion occurs.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the motion lines positioned along the sides of the bike and angled forward, without crossing over the chain, derailleur, or “DUCATI” logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motion lines are evident along the sides of the bike providing an impression of speed. They are predominantly placed behind the bicycle and radiate outward, cleverly avoiding intersections with crucial components like the chain, derailleur, or the 'DUCATI' logo on the frame. This placement aligns with conveying dynamic movement without obstructing vital features.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the frame retain its original tubular structure and dimensional consistency despite the added hero suit design, with no bulges, collapses, or incorrect curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the enhanced comic book style exhibited in Image B, the frame largely retains its original tubular design and structural consistency. Visual modifications present themselves primarily through decorative elements, like colors and patterns on the frame, but these don't impact its physical integrity or introduce incorrect physiological changes such as bulges or collapses.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sound effect texts positioned outside the main structural components of the bike and oriented in a way that suggests movement, without obscuring the “DUCATI” branding or control levers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the altered Image B, the 'Voom!!' sound effect text is cleverly positioned outside the main body of the bike, near the upper left region. This placement ensures clarity of the text while contributing to the dynamic feel of motion. It is placed sufficiently away from the 'DUCATI' logo and control levers, thereby avoiding obstruction of these vital branding elements and functional components.",
