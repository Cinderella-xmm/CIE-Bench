      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the qipao clearly defined with consistent outlines and no broken or distorted petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the qipao are examined for clarity and outline consistency. The patterns appear to have well-defined outlines with no visible distortion or broken petals, suggesting a high level of detail in the design. This implies careful craftsmanship or digital editing to ensure the patterns remain consistent and visually appealing.",

      "question": "Do the jade-patterned clasps align correctly along the central seam and display consistent shape and size without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the jade-patterned clasps appear to be well-aligned along the central seam of the qipao. The shapes and sizes of the clasps seem consistent, indicating that they are placed thoughtfully without any noticeable deformation, maintaining the garment's symmetry and design integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the color distribution across the qipao uniform, with no visible banding or abrupt transitions between hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color distribution on the qipao in Image B is evaluated by examining the transitions between different shades. The red of the garment is evenly applied, and there are no noticeable bands or abrupt color changes, implying uniformity in hue distribution.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the detachable writing sections placed with clean edges and consistent lighting, and do they appear anchored to the garment rather than floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the writing sections are scrutinized for placement and integration with the garment. The edges of these sections appear clean, suggesting careful editing. The lighting on these panels is consistent with the rest of the image, making them appear naturally anchored to the qipao's surface rather than floating independently.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand show five fingers with normal spacing, natural curvature, and no extra or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand depicted in Image B is observed for the count and placement of fingers. The hand shows five fingers, each with appropriate spacing and natural curvature, adhering to the typical human anatomy with no extra or missing digits.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In evaluating Image B, the overall proportions and spatial coherence of the qipao and its components are considered. The dress and its adornments, including the floral patterns, clasps, and writing sections, appear proportionally balanced. There are no signs of stretching or compression, suggesting that the elements are well-integrated and spatially harmonious.",
