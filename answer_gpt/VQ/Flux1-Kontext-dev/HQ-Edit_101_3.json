      "question": "Does the illustrated bird retain the original bird's body proportions and head-to-body ratio without exaggerated or distorted features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrated bird on the packaging appears to maintain the same body proportions and head-to-body ratio as observed in Image A. The head size relative to its body and wings look consistent with what can be inferred from the original photograph. The transition to an illustration preserves these proportions, avoiding any exaggeration typical of cartoonish features. This indicates that the artist's representation stayed true to the realistic proportions of the original bird.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossom motifs surrounding the bird evenly spaced and proportionally consistent with the original flowers in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossom motifs are styled around the bird in a neat manner similar to Image A. While transitioning to an illustrated form, they maintain consistent spacing around the bird and do not appear congested or disproportionate compared to the bird or each other. The blossoms complement the bird both in their detailed illustration and in their proportional relationship, mirroring the realistic photography from Image A.",

      "question": "Is the typographic logo positioned at the top of the image with smooth edges and uniform spacing, free from pixelation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typographic logo in Image B is placed prominently at the top of the packaging, and the edges appear smooth and clear without any signs of pixelation or blurring. The spacing between the letters is uniform, contributing to a professionally designed look appropriate for packaging. This suggests a high-resolution printing or rendering of the logo that maintains clarity and legibility.",

      "question": "Does the pastel gradient background transition smoothly from one hue to another without visible banding or sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a pastel gradient background that provides a soft transition between hues. There are no visible bands or sharp edges where the color changes, indicating a smooth gradient. This contributes to a serene and aesthetically pleasing packaging design as would be expected in premium product presentation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the yellow color of the illustrated bird uniformly applied across its body without patches of over-saturation or loss of fine texture detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The yellow color across the bird in Image B is applied uniformly, avoiding areas of over-saturation that would disrupt the overall visual appearance. The illustration maintains fine texture details, similar to the realistic photograph in Image A, indicating careful attention to preserving texture through color gradation and shading techniques. This suggests an intention to retain a high level of detail in the illustration.",
