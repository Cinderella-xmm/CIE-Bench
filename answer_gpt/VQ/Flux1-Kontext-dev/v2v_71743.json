      "question": "Does the transformed texture of the paint splatter maintain a natural appearance without introducing any unnatural artifacts or disrupting the visual flow of the guitar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background featuring a New York cityscape instead of an abstract paint splatter provides a more realistic scene that complements the guitar's presence rather than disrupting it. The transition is smooth and maintains the visual flow without unnatural interruptions. Using a city skyline aligns with the theme of 'New York' and integrates well with other elements. Overall, there is harmony in the design, and no unnatural artifacts disrupt the guitar's flow.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the guitar's proportions and physical structure preserved, avoiding any distortion or unnatural deformation after the style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the guitar maintains its structure and proportions, including the neck, body, and pickups. There is no evident distortion or deformation present. Comparing with Image A, which also maintains these features, the transformation does not alter the guitar's physical attributes but simply changes the background, ensuring consistency in its appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the guitar, like strings and pickups, been maintained without any loss or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fine details, such as the guitar strings and pickups, are still visible and appear intact. The strings are neatly in place, and the pickups retain their detail, similar to those in Image A. The transformation primarily involves the background change and does not interfere with the guitar's intricate components.",

      "question": "Do the new design elements introduced to shift the overall aesthetic align coherently with the chosen concept, avoiding any visual inconsistencies or disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The change from an abstract splatter to a cityscape in Image B fits the theme suggested by the title 'NEW YORK Guitar Method.' This visual aligns with the concept and background without causing inconsistencies. The coherence between the guitar and the New York skyline indicates an intentional design choice, maintaining aesthetic alignment and avoiding visual disruptions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the primary title \"NEW YORK Guitar Method\" still clear and legible, without blending into the background or being obscured by the new design elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'NEW YORK Guitar Method' remains bold and legible against the green background. Like in Image A, the text does not blend into the background and stands out clearly. The cityscape does not hinder its visibility. This ensures that the title remains prominent and easily readable.",
