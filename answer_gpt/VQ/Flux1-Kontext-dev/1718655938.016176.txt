    "Question": "Q1: Are the outlines of the church's steeple, roof, and walls clearly defined and geometrically consistent, without broken or warped edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the church is illustrated with clear, bold lines that define the edges of the steeple, roof, and walls. The lines are uniform and consistent with a cartoonish style, ensuring geometric precision with no signs of distortion or warping. This artistic choice results in well-defined shapes and harmonious structure, typical of illustrative depictions where clean lines are emphasized.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the candy-like tree replacements composed of smooth, continuous shapes with consistent surface textures, and do they maintain plausible proportions relative to the church?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows trees that are stylized to resemble a candy world, featuring smooth, continuous shapes and a consistent, uniform surface texture that aligns with the cartoon theme. The proportions relative to the church are maintained appropriately, ensuring the trees contribute to the fantastical setting without overpowering the main structure of the church.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the patchwork quilt sky feature uniform stitching lines and consistent color blending between patches, with no visible seams or sharp discontinuities?",
    "explanation": "The sky in Image B is designed with swirling cloud-like patterns that mimic a patchwork quilt effect. The transitions between colors are smooth, creating an illusion of seamless blending. Given the stylized nature of the image, there are no visible stitching lines or discontinuities, with the colors blending harmoniously into each other, enhancing the dream-like quality of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the light sources from the church windows cast consistent, soft shadows on the surrounding grass and path, matching the direction and intensity of the internal glow?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the light source from the church windows is represented, there's an apparent lack of shadow casting on the ground or surrounding objects. Given the cartoonish and stylized manner of the depiction, shadows are not rendered or emphasized in line with typical shadowing techniques, although the internal glow is consistent.",
    "answer": "No"
