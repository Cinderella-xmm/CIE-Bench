      "question": "Does the holographic dragon eye on the watch face exhibit smooth gradients and consistent lighting without pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural glow artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the holographic dragon eye in Image B, the design appears smooth and well-rendered with no noticeable pixelation or jagged edges. World knowledge about digital displays and lighting effects in design suggests that proper consistency in gradients and lighting is crucial to avoid glow artifacts. The image shows a clean presentation without these imperfections, indicating high-quality visual design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the silver scales on the band evenly aligned, properly shaded, and free from gaps or overlapping segments that break geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silver scales on the watch band are observed to be evenly aligned with consistent spacing. Understanding of geometric design principles informs us that well-shaded and properly aligned elements are vital for aesthetic appeal and functionality. No gaps or overlapping segments are visible, suggesting a coherently designed band.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glowing neural node on the side of the watch case properly integrated with the casing, showing consistent illumination and no unnatural light leakage or distortion in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing neural node in Image B is seamlessly integrated into the watch case, maintaining consistent illumination. Knowledge about lighting effects in electronics suggests that proper integration minimizes unnatural light leakage and preserves shape integrity. The node shows no signs of distortion or excessive light beyond the designed area.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the luminescent control sigils on the watch face maintain clear boundaries and consistent brightness levels without blurring or ghosting around their edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminescent control sigils in Image B exhibit sharp boundaries and uniform brightness, which is essential in digital displays for clarity and readability. World knowledge about electronic interfaces indicates that blurring or ghosting compromises the visual experience and functionality. The sigils are clear with no evidence of these artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all components of the watch—case, band, crown, and side button—proportionally aligned and structurally coherent without visible warping, stretching, or misplacement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all components of the watch, including the case, band, crown, and side button, appear proportionally aligned and structurally coherent. Drawing from knowledge about watch design, proper alignment and structure are key for aesthetic and practical purposes. There are no signs of warping, stretching, or misplacement, indicating a well-crafted image.",
