      "question": "Does the surface of the teapot’s body exhibit a consistent, smooth high-gloss ceramic finish without visible texture artifacts or abrupt transitions from the original metallic look?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot’s body appears to be rendered with a high-gloss ceramic finish. This can be determined by its smooth and shiny appearance, which is typical of ceramic materials. There are no visible texture artifacts, rough spots, or abrupt transitions that would differentiate it from the typical look of ceramics, which is consistent throughout the body. This contrasts with Image A, which shows a metallic and intricately detailed surface typical of silverware. The transition from a textured metallic to a smooth ceramic appearance is seamless in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the wick positioned at the tip of the former spout location in a straight, vertical orientation that aligns naturally with the candle design, without bending or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wick emerges from the tip of the former spout location in a straight, vertical manner, typical of candle wicks which are usually designed to remain straight to function effectively. This aligns naturally with the idea of transforming the teapot into a candle, and no bending or deformation is noticeable. Whereas in Image A, the spout is a functional part of the teapot, carrying no wick. The wick in Image B seems appropriately placed and fits aesthetically within the candle design.",

      "question": "Is the handle now rendered as a solid gold-colored accent with no visible remnants of the original wood or metal, and does it retain its original curvature without warping or unnatural thickness changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle appears as a consistent ivory-colored element with gold accents. There are no visible remnants of the original wood or metal textures present in Image A's handle, which is primarily wooden with metal fixings. The handle in Image B retains the elegant curvature found in Image A, without evident warping or thickness changes. It complements the overall luxury design seamlessly.",

      "question": "Are the floral patterns around the base of the teapot evenly spaced, proportionally scaled, and stylistically consistent with the existing engraved motifs, without overlapping or distorting the base structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the teapot does not display the intricate engraved floral motifs seen in Image A. Instead, it appears with simple gold accents without any decorative overlaps or distortions. While Image A has detailed engravings that align with an ornate metallic style, Image B adopts a minimalistic approach consistent with ceramic and gold-style finishes, focusing more on smooth and consistent motifs.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Eternal Elegance Candle\" placed centrally on the front face of the teapot in a flowing script font that matches the luxury theme, with no pixelation, shadowing, or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Eternal Elegance Candle' is situated centrally on the teapot’s front face, designed in a flowing script font that aligns with the luxurious theme of the object. The placement complements the teapot's shape, and the text appears clear and free of pixelation, shadowing issues, or clipping artifacts. This text addition is consistent with the aesthetics seen in sophisticated branding, contrasting Image A’s lack of any text or branding.",
