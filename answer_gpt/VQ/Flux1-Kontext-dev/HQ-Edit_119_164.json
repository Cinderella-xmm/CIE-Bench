    {

      "question": "Do the celestial sails replacing the elephant's ears maintain a consistent size and attachment point relative to the head, without warping or unnatural stretching of the surrounding skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's ears are transformed into celestial sails with a cosmic texture. The size and placement appear proportionate to the elephant's head. The attachment point at the head is consistent, with no visible signs of warping or unnatural stretching, suggesting a careful and smooth integration of the celestial patterning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cosmic mist emanating from the tip of the trunk smoothly integrated into the scene without jagged edges, overlapping artifacts, or inconsistent opacity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual inspection of Image B shows a smooth integration of cosmic mist emanating from the trunk. The mist has a soft, consistent transition into the surrounding area without any jagged edges or overlapping artifacts, indicating a well-executed blend into the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the planetary rings around the elephant's legs evenly spaced and aligned with the limb axes, without clipping into the leg surface or appearing misaligned due to perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the planetary rings around the elephant's legs are visually examined for spacing and alignment. They appear evenly spaced and aligned with the axes of the limbs, maintaining a consistent appearance from different angles. There are no visible signs of clipping into the leg surface, suggesting a coherent application of the effect.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the luminescent star patterns on the elephant’s feet appear embedded within the foot surface rather than floating above it, with no haloing or color spill onto adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminescent star patterns on the feet in Image B are analyzed for integration with the foot surface. They appear embedded and naturally part of the surface, with no evidence of floating above it. There is no visible haloing or color spill onto adjacent areas, indicating well-blended effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the galaxy-patterned skin follow the natural folds and creases of the elephant’s body, maintaining consistent texture resolution and avoiding abrupt transitions or stretched patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the galaxy pattern covers the elephant's skin. Upon inspection, the texture follows the natural contours, folds, and creases of the elephant's body. The texture resolution appears consistent across the body, without signs of abrupt transitions or stretches, suggesting an effectively integrated pattern.",
