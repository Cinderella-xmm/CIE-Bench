    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the bust have a visibly coherent head-to-body proportion where the head is enlarged relative to the torso but remains structurally plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions commonly seen in chibi or stylized forms involve an enlarged head relative to a smaller torso. The enlarged head and smaller body in the bust are typical of stylized art and remain structurally plausible, adhering to known artistic conventions for exaggerated forms.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial features simplified but still clearly defined, with no missing or distorted elements such as eyes or mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, facial features often are simplified in stylized representations like busts, but should still be clearly defined without obvious distortions. The image does not show missing elements or distorted features even though detailed features beyond the blurred face are not visible. However, stylized busts usually maintain coherence without distortion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the embroidered patterns on the robe appear continuous and logically structured, without jagged edges or disrupted textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robe in Image B resembles neat and structured lines typical of embroidery patterns without visible jagged edges or disruption. This accuracy is common in high-quality sculpted models where continuity and craftsmanship are prioritized.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the stripes on the headdress evenly spaced and smoothly colored, without visible artifacts such as color bleeding or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays evenly spaced stripes on the headdress and smooth color application, which suggests attention to detail and avoidance of artifacts. Misalignment or color bleeding would be inconsistent with the observed uniformity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the pomegranate have a glossy surface with natural-looking highlights that do not distort its shape or create false reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pomegranate in Image B shows a glossy finish with highlights accurately reflecting light without distortion. This suggests careful rendering of reflective properties to maintain realism and prevent unnatural reflections.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the wooden base fully attached to the bust and visually grounded, with no floating or misaligned sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base appears securely attached and grounded. There are no indications of misalignment or floating sections, portraying a solid and coherent attachment typical of a properly assembled bust.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the pomegranate have exactly five fingers with natural joint angles and no deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a hand holding a pomegranate with five fingers in a natural pose, characterizing typical hand anatomy consistently. This includes joint angles that convey natural human hand structure without deformation or added fingers.",
