      "question": "Does the adult character’s face retain symmetrical and proportionate features with clearly defined eyes, mouth, and cheeks without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the features of the adult character's face are obscured by blur, which affects the symmetry and proportion perception. Based on the visual cues, there are no clearly defined eyes, mouth, and cheeks, leading to distortion.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glow from the book creates a soft halo effect that gently illuminates the surrounding area, particularly the hands holding the book, without significantly altering their color or clarity. The background remains largely unaffected by this glow.",
