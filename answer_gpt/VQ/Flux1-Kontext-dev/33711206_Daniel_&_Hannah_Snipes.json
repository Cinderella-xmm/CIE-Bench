        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the eyes reveals that they are positioned accurately within the facial structure, and there are no indications of distortion or uneven spacing. The facial proportions remain intact, suggesting that any enlargement has been done with consideration to maintaining natural appearance and alignment. This conclusion is reached by observing the alignment of features such as spacing and proportional fit within the profiles Viewable within Image B.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of both the woman and child are examined closely. The visual cues indicate that each hand displays five fingers, appropriately curved and spaced, without signs of overlapping or any missing digits. These observations highlight that the fingers exhibit natural human anatomy in terms of count and shape.",

      "question": "Are the color transitions across the woman’s dress, the child’s dress, and the background flowers smooth and free of sharp digital edges or unnatural blotches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B reveals that the color transitions across the various elements like the dresses and flowers are smooth, showing a natural blend of colors without abrupt digital edges or unpleasant blotching. This indicates that the editing respects the harmony of colors, contributing to the overall aesthetic quality of the image, achieved through effective use of color gradient techniques.",

      "question": "Are the added floral accents in the background consistent in size, lighting, and texture with the existing flowers and do they cast plausible shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B, the floral accents need to be assessed for size, lighting, and texture. The floral accents appear consistent with the existing flowers in these respects, maintaining uniformity in appearance. Additionally, their shadows are observed to be plausibly cast, aligning well with natural light influences, ensuring coherence and authenticity in the garden setting.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden border of the frame is scrutinized for consistency in its thickness and alignment. It showcases a uniform thickness, a realistic wood grain texture, and is properly aligned with the edges of the framed image. There is no evidence of warping or gaps, which signifies meticulous attention to detail in framing execution.",
