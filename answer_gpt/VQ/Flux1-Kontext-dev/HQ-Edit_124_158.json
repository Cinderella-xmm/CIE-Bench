      "question": "Does the cat maintain natural proportions and anatomical structure without visible stretching, compression, or deformation in the shadow box scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat lying on the settee appears to have exaggerated proportions, perhaps due to an intentional artistic choice. Its body is unusually rotund, and while cats can be fluffy or large, this depiction seems more exaggerated than realistic. This might not align with natural anatomical proportions seen in typical cats.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the materials of the settee (velvet and wood) rendered with realistic textures and consistent lighting, showing no signs of pixelation, mismatched shading, or artificial seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the settee appears well-rendered with velvet upholstery and carved wooden elements. The textures look realistic, with the velvet showing soft, rich lighting effects and the wood displaying intricate details without signs of pixelation, mismatched shading, or artificial seams.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the velvet curtains appear physically plausible with correct fold patterns, soft shadows, and seamless integration into the background without floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the velvet curtains have well-defined fold patterns and soft shadows that give them a realistic appearance. They are correctly integrated into the scene without noticeable floating or misaligned edges, contributing to the overall coherent setting.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gilded columns properly scaled, positioned with correct perspective, and rendered with reflective metallic surfaces that match the ambient light without artifacts like blurring or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gilded columns are appropriately scaled and positioned, providing structure to the shadow box. Their metallic surfaces reflect ambient light in a realistic manner, and there are no visible artifacts such as blurring or jagged edges, ensuring the columns fit naturally into the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the hanging mouse portraits clearly visible, correctly sized relative to the scene, and mounted with realistic shadows and string attachments without visual glitches or texture errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portraits of mice are clear and distinct, scaled appropriately in relation to the other elements in the scene. They are hung with visible strings and are accompanied by realistic shadows that anchor them in the 3D space of the shadow box, with no visual glitches or texture errors.",
