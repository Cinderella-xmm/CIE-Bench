      "question": "Does the miniature robot model retain accurate proportions and intact geometric shapes compared to the original robot, with no visible stretching, compression, or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the accuracy of proportions and geometric shapes, we examine the robot in Image B for any visible distortions or misaligned joints. In Image A, the robot has a clear structure, defined shapes, and proportions. In comparison, the robot in Image B, being a miniature within a display case, retains the original's proportions and geometric integrity. It doesn't exhibit any noticeable stretching, compression, or alignment issues, which suggests that the robot model is accurately preserved in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the circular display case transparent and smooth, with natural light interaction and no jagged edges, double outlines, or artificial artifacts around its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a circular display case which is intended to mimic a glass sphere, featuring soft reflections and smooth surfaces. Upon inspection, the case appears transparent and interacts naturally with light, showing no signs of jagged edges or double outlines. The absence of artificial artifacts and the consistent clarity indicate that the display case is well-rendered.",

      "question": "Are the tiny gears visible under transparent panels correctly aligned with the robot’s surface, uniformly detailed, and free from overlapping or floating anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B for tiny gears under transparent panels involves checking for alignment, detail, and anomalies. However, given Image B does not prominently feature minute details such as gears and focus is more on the robot and its encapsulation, there's no evidence of floating anomalies or visible detail inconsistencies. Therefore, this question might not apply directly, or the aspects are properly integrated without faults.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hexagonal base geometrically precise, with uniform edges and a consistent matte-black finish, and does the model number text appear sharp and evenly glowing without haloing or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hexagonal base in Image B has sharp, clean edges that denote geometric precision. The matte-black finish appears consistent across the surface. Additionally, the model number text 'MODEL 393' is sharp, clear, and uniformly glowing, with no halo effect or distortion. These observations suggest a well-defined and precise design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the mini landscape surrounding the display include naturally scaled trees, ground textures, and distant cityscape elements that maintain spatial consistency with the size of the display case and model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landscape within the display case includes scaled-down elements such as trees and a distant cityscape, closely mimicking those in Image A. These elements are proportionately smaller, aligning the spatial relationship with the robot model’s reduced size within the spherical display, which maintains spatial consistency and ensures a coherent miniature environment.",
