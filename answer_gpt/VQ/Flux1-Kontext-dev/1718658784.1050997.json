      "question": "Does the cake’s icing display bold, graphic patterns that are evenly distributed and free from distorted textures or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake's icing appears to be converted into a uniform pattern using pop art style. The graphic treatment involves vivid colors and dotted patterns, typical of pop art transformations, which ensure bold and even graphical presentation. Since pop art focuses on simplifying forms, there's an emphasis on maintaining the regularity and consistency of patterns without introducing distortions or breaks, which is evident in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the balloons represented as uniform monochrome dots that maintain their original spherical form and clustered grouping without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows that the balloons are transformed using contrasting colors, depicted as uniform shapes, and filled with dotted patterns indicative of pop art style. They maintain their spherical forms and are clustered together similarly to traditional balloons. This transformation preserves their original shape within the new color scheme, ensuring no geometric distortion occurs.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the table and vase been converted into solid, contrasting color blocks with sharp, clean edges and no residual textures or blending artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table and vase are converted into geometric forms with distinct use of bright and contrasting color blocks. The edges appear sharp and clean, and the pop art style utilized removes any residual textures or blending artifacts, focusing instead on solid colors and clear delineation between objects.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the candle flame feature exaggerated sharp lines and bright hues while remaining attached to the wick and showing an upward directional flow without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the candle and flame using pop art effects, characterized by exaggerated lines and vibrant colors. The flame is depicted in a way that emphasizes upward directional flow and remains visually connected to the candle's wick, consistent with pop art's tendency to exaggerate and simplify features without introducing misalignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all edited elements positioned consistently within the scene’s depth and perspective, with no floating or misplaced components relative to the table and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the exaggerated graphic treatment typical of pop art, all elements within the scene maintain their original spatial relationships. The balloons, cake, candle, and vase are positioned consistently, preserving the scene's depth and perspective without the introduction of illogical placement or floating components. The transformation focuses on color and pattern modifications rather than altering the structure or perspective of the image.",
