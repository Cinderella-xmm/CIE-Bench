    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the owl's head retain proper geometric proportions with a beak that aligns with the jawline and eyes that are symmetrically placed and shaped like those of a real owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the owl's head, the beak's alignment with the jawline is obscured by blurring, but we can assess the owl's outline and see whether it's symmetric based on the rest of the visible features. In a well-proportioned owl illustration, the eyes would be symmetrically placed, with a beak appropriately aligned. The analysis requires assessing the overall head shape, where symmetry and cohesive placement of facial features are key for proper proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the feathers on the cloak consistent in direction, shading, and density, and do they blend naturally with the original blue color without visible seams or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the actual look and integration of the feathers on the cloak need to be evaluated. Consistency in the direction and shading as well as smooth blending into the blue fabric are qualities that designate successful illustration without apparent lines or pixelation discordance. The analysis involves scrutinizing the cloak surface for uniform feather arrangement and color transition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glasses resting securely on the beak with correct reflection and shadow placement, and do they match the size and style of typical reading glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, the placement of glasses on the beak, their reflection, and shadowing are critical for assessing realism. Glasses should align with typical reading styles, maintaining realistic proportions that fit an illustration of an owl. The examination involves viewing any remaining places or cues where glasses might be positioned and evaluating reflection accuracy regarding light sources.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hand replaced with a wing-like structure that has logical joint placement and feather coverage, and does it lack extra fingers or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays wing-like structures, necessitating an assessment of their anatomical correctness, such as joint alignment typical of avian physiology alongside even feather coating. A logical structure lacks unwarranted finger-like appendages or unnatural curvatures that deviate from wing anatomy.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the speech bubbles placed adjacent to the beak, contain legible text with contrasting colors, and do not overlap with other elements like the microphone or feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's speech bubbles should be clear and legible, placed in positions that don't conflict with other image elements like the microphone or the subject's features. Examining contrast and proximity is necessary to determine clarity and comprehension without overlap.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the branches extend from the background with natural tapering and bark texture, and are they positioned behind the subject without casting incorrect shadows or appearing flat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To evaluate Image B, observe the branch positioning and attributes. Branches should naturally recede, demonstrating realistic bark texture and tapering. Their spatial relationship with the main subject should prevent them from casting misplaced shadows or flattening perspective. This requires examining their visual depth and placement.",
