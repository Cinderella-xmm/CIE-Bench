      "question": "Does the glass dome have natural transparency and refraction effects that match the lighting direction and shadow patterns from the window, without visible artifacts such as uneven edges or unrealistic glare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears to have a natural transparency and shows realistic refraction effects that align well with the scene's lighting direction. There are no visible artifacts such as uneven edges, and there is no unrealistic glare, suggesting a careful rendering of the glass material that maintains consistency with the natural light falling onto the teapot and table.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the vintage wooden base visually consistent in color, texture, and grain pattern with the surrounding wooden table, and does the velvet lining appear soft and layered without pixelation or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B closely matches the color, texture, and grain pattern of the surrounding table, indicating consistency in material rendering. The velvet lining on the base appears soft and layered, displaying a realistic texture without any noticeable pixelation or unnatural sheen, suggesting attention to the tactile quality in the editing process.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the flowering plants and ferns emerging from the spout and lid grow in a way that follows natural botanical form and maintains contact with the teapot's surface without floating or breaking geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flowering plants and ferns in Image B emerge naturally from the teapot, exhibiting a realistic botanical form. Their arrangement follows a logical growth pattern from the teapot's spout and lid, maintaining contact with the surface and not appearing to float or disrupt geometric continuity, implying that they are well-integrated into the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the butterflies positioned at plausible flight heights and angles near the floral engravings, with visible wings and body details that match the scale and lighting of the scene, and do they cast subtle shadows on the teapot surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterflies in Image B are placed at plausible flight heights and angles around the teapot. They show detailed wing structure and body features that match the scene's scale and lighting, and they cast subtle shadows on the teapot's surface, blending naturally into the composition and enhancing the realism of the scene.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The newly added elements in Image B are rendered in muted earth tones that integrate well with the original silver teapot and the wooden background. There is no presence of bright or jarring color contrasts, allowing the scene to maintain a cohesive and visually appealing look, demonstrating careful consideration of color harmony in the editing process.",
