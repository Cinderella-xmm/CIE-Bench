        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus and its sombrero appear to have a very clear and uniform knitted texture. The stitches are consistently visible and evenly spaced, which aligns with common knitting techniques, displaying a coherent knitting style across these elements.
