      "question": "Does the seaside café tabletop setting blend naturally with the table surface, avoiding any noticeable break in texture or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop surface shows a consistent grain and lighting pattern. The table's texture appears integrated, with no visible inconsistencies at the junctions of surface material that would indicate an edited or overlayed image. The lighting complements the surrounding environment, suggesting a natural continuation of the table's texture without disruption.",

      "question": "Are the shapes and proportions of sea waves and sunlight reflections accurately depicted, maintaining structural consistency without unnatural breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a seascape background with waves and reflections of sunlight. The waves are uniformly depicted with regular curvatures, and the sunlight reflections appear logical, consistent with typical ocean wave formations. There are no obvious distortions or breaks in either the shape of the waves or the alignment of the reflections.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the materials of the seaside elements, such as the table, sea waves, and sunlight reflections, appear authentic, free from unnatural textures and visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the tabletop emits a wood-like texture, complemented by consistent lighting. The sea waves and reflections display natural water characteristics without appearing artificial or affected by editing artifacts, maintaining authenticity in their presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sunlight reflections on the sea waves consistent with the sun's expected position, maintaining physical logic and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows sunlight reflections that align logically with the direction of light implied by the shadows on the table and chair in the foreground. The reflection angles correspond to typical solar positions during daylight, adding to the visual credibility of the seaside scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the seaside café setting fit naturally on the tabletop, enhancing the image's visual coherence without introducing distracting or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B integrates the phone and its stand naturally into the seaside setting with a wooden table seamlessly continuing into the outdoor view. It does not affect the visual flow or introduce elements that detract from the coherence of the image. Everything from the table to the external view fits together, creating a harmonious and visually appealing setting.",
