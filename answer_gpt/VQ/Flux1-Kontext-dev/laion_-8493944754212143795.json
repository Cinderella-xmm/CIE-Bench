      "question": "Does the shimmering mane formed from the water maintain fluid motion and transparency consistent with the original waterfall, without appearing solid or rigid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's mane is visually constructed from water flowing over the rock. The mane appears as an extension of the waterfall, maintaining the fluidity and transparency of the water, much like in Image A, where the waterfall exhibits natural motion and transparency. The appearance of the mane does not suggest solidity or rigidity but rather aligns closely with the dynamic nature of the waterfall.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scale patterns on the transformed rock body seamlessly integrated with the original stone texture, without visible seams, unnatural repetition, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed rock body where the dragon resides retains aspects of the original stone texture observed in Image A. The scales of the dragon do not show visible seams or awkward repetition but seem to be naturally overlaid on the rock surface. There is no noticeable distortion of the geometric stone features, leading to a seamless integration with the original texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cloud wings formed from the foam extend naturally from the dragon’s body and align with the direction of water movement, without appearing detached or floating unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the dragon with wing-like extensions formed by the water foam. These wings appear to follow the natural direction of water movement, similar to the water flow visible in Image A. The wings do not give off a detached or an unnatural floating appearance, instead they seem part of the continuous water motion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing blue runes embedded into the scales with smooth, diffused light emission and no sharp edges or unnatural brightness that disrupts the surrounding texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue runes embedded into the dragon's scales display a smooth and diffused light emission. The glow is integrated subtly without sharp edges or excessive brightness that would disrupt the texture continuity with the surrounding rock and water. The harmonious light distribution matches the soft natural lighting of the scene observed in Image A.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dragon’s body and wings match the direction and intensity of natural sunlight in the original scene, without conflicting illumination or floating highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows and highlights on the dragon's body and wings are consistent with the direction and intensity of sunlight as seen on the rocks and water in Image A. The highlights maintain coherence with the natural sunlight pattern, and there are no areas indicating conflicting illumination or isolated floating highlights.",
