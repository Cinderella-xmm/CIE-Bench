      "question": "Do the mechanical sentinels replacing the buses have intact geometric shapes, smooth surfaces, and consistent glowing blue underlights without visible rendering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buses appear as mechanical sentinels with a futuristic design in place of traditional vehicles. Visually, the geometric shapes and smooth surfaces are maintained, as there are no noticeable distortions or abrupt transitions in their form. The glowing blue underlights are consistent across the bottom area of the sentinels. Combined with world knowledge of how futuristic technology is often depicted in media, where smooth, flawless surfaces and consistent lighting are common traits, it is evident that the depiction has no visible rendering artifacts.",

      "question": "Does the golden automaton version of Big Ben have uniform metallic texture, proper vertical alignment, and a centrally placed cosmic eye clockface without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of Big Ben in Image B transforms it into a golden automaton-like structure, suggesting a texture that resembles metallic surfaces. Visually, the texture appears uniform across the structure, with no visible irregularities. The alignment remains vertical, consistent with the structure's traditional form. The cosmic eye clockface is depicted centrally without distortion, aligning with world knowledge that such designs emphasize central placement and symmetry for visual appeal.",

      "question": "Are the energetic vines wrapped around the Houses of Parliament following plausible growth patterns, maintaining consistent glow, and not intersecting through solid architectural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, energetic vines appear to wrap around structures. These vines maintain a consistent glow, possibly to emphasize an energy-based nature. The growth patterns are visually plausible, as they appear to follow natural contours without an aggressive intersection through architectural elements, aligning with world knowledge of how organic and synthetic elements are often depicted in fictionâ€”shown as integrating rather than destructively cutting through solid structures.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the airships in the sky properly scaled, positioned at a reasonable altitude, and displaying iridescent surfaces without harsh edges or shadow mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The airships in Image B are depicted with appropriate scale and altitude, proportional to the size of the surrounding architecture and humans (as indicated by the buses). They exhibit iridescent surfaces typical of advanced technology, without harsh edges that would indicate poor integration. There are no evident shadow mismatches that would suggest an unnatural fit with the scene's lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements (underlights, cosmic eye, vines, airships) blend with the ambient lighting of the scene without creating overly bright spots or unnatural contrast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, glowing elements such as underlights, cosmic eye, and others are integrated with the scene's ambient lighting. The consistency and blending prevent overly bright spots that would disrupt the overall visual balance. The ambient lighting appears to transition smoothly, suggesting familiarity with aesthetic rendering where contrast and brightness are carefully curated to avoid jarring separation between light sources and ambient backdrop.",
