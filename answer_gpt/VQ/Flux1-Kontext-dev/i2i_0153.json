      "question": "Does the truck maintain its original proportions and structural integrity without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck appears well-proportioned, maintaining its structural integrity. The geometric shapes, such as the cab, wheels, and grille, are drawn accurately, following typical design principles for this type of vehicle, without any evident distortion. Visual cues indicate that the truck's shape is consistent, a conclusion supported by the clean and uniform outline of the body. By observing the edited image alone, there are no signs of broken or distorted shapes, which suggest the truck's proportions and geometry are preserved correctly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces and textures of the truck, such as the wheels, cab, and grille, free from unnatural artifacts and retain appropriate levels of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized version of the truck, lacking detailed textures typically found in natural imagery. Instead, it uses simplified color fills and line work that are characteristic of digital illustrations. While there are no artifacts, the level of detail is intentionally minimalistic and stylized, which deviates from realistic textural representation. Therefore, while free from unnatural artifacts, they do not retain realistic texture levels.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cab's vibrant colors appear natural against the truck's materials and lighting conditions, ensuring material consistency and avoiding unrealistic contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cab features a bright red color that visually fits with the simplified and stylized illustration style. The vibrant color harmonizes with the overall palette, maintaining consistency within the context of a digitally illustrated image. However, in comparison to real-world materials and lighting dynamics, the color usage is stylized rather than natural, as the image favors bold and simplistic coloring over nuanced realism typically associated with material consistency.",

      "question": "Is the simplified background naturally integrated with the truck, maintaining the overall authenticity of the scene without introducing distracting or out-of-place elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartoonish background that complements the truck's stylized design. The background lacks realistic detail and is intentionally simple, which aligns with the artistic approach, ensuring there are no distracting elements or inconsistencies. The integration of the truck into this background maintains scene coherence consistent with the illustration style, not deviating from the simplified visual theme.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wheels maintain their structural and physical logic, with no signs of distortion or misalignment, thereby preserving the truck's visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the truck's wheels drawn in a consistent manner with proper alignment and appropriate proportions. The wheels' circular shape and placement adhere to logical structural expectations for this type of vehicle. The style choice does not introduce distortion or misalignment, thus preserving the truck's visual credibility within the context of a stylized image.",
