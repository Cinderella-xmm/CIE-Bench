      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the woman’s face maintain symmetrical features with proportionate eyes, nose, and mouth, and does her hair flow naturally without unnatural bending or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The question explicitly asks about features we should avoid evaluating due to the blurred face. For the hair, visually in Image B, the hair appears smooth and falls naturally over the shoulders with no evident signs of distortion, clipping, or abnormal bends. Hence, while the face evaluation is bypassed, the hair matches the typical characteristics of natural and well-rendered flows.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gold-embossed floral patterns on the robe evenly distributed, aligned with the fabric folds, and free from pixelation or floating edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns are presented with detailed gold embossing that matches the fabric's surface smoothly. The patterns run along the robe in a symmetrical, cohesive manner that aligns with the overall flow and folds of the garment. There is no evident pixelation or disjointed edges in the design, indicating a high-quality image rendering without artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the red lanterns emit a soft, consistent glow that illuminates nearby areas without creating harsh halos or unrealistic light leakage onto the woman’s robe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red lanterns are illustrated as part of a design rather than having a direct photorealistic lighting effect. As they’re part of the drawing within the calendar layout, there's no actual glow that affects other elements, such as the woman's robe. Therefore, within the context, there is an appropriate and realistic portrayal without issues of light leakage or halos.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background rendered as a uniform cream paper texture with faint month grids and floral patterns matching the robe’s design, without overlapping or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a backdrop consistent with a calendar style, with a cream colored paper texture. The grid lines are clear and uninterrupted across the background. The floral patterns echo those of the robe, showing careful alignment without overlapping or being misaligned, which speaks to meticulous design coherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the calendar grid lines and month labels positioned in a way that follows the floral patterns of the robe without causing misalignment or breaking the continuity of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar elements are integrated into the design so that they do not disrupt or misalign with the robe’s floral motifs. The grid lines and text are placed so that they harmonize with the rest of the design, maintaining the visual flow without inconsistency in the placement of elements.",
