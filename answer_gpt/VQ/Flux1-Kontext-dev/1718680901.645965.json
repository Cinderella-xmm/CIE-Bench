    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the spires and roof layers of the creature aligned with the original building's structure, showing no signs of bending, breaking, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure atop the building maintains the same complex design as the original building in Image A. The spires and roof layers are crucial architectural elements conveying a traditional aesthetic style, likely inspired by Asian temples. They appear correctly aligned in Image B, suggesting careful adjustment in the editing process to preserve the original alignment and structural integrity. Therefore, the reasoning includes analyzing both alignment and breaking from visual cues in Image B without referring to Image A, and inferring that the edited image presents no visible misalignment due to deliberate maintenance of the original style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the orb at the creature’s feet feature pillars and arches that match the architectural style of the creature and have consistent texture and lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the orb is positioned in the foreground and exhibits a design that reflects elements consistent with the building. The orb features detailed patterns and structural elements such as slight columnar patterns which, through visual analysis combined with the structure of the main building, seem to match the architectural style. Additionally, the consistent lighting evoking a warm ambiance across the entire scene suggests careful integration of the orb with the surroundings. The reasoning involves observing detailed patterning on the orb and recognizing its harmony with the building's texture.",

      "question": "Is the invented name displayed near the creature legible, properly sized, and positioned without overlapping the creature or water reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible text near the creature when analyzing the visual elements. The foreground and background consist of textures and architectural features; however, text related to an invented name does not appear. Thus, reasoning involves identifying areas where text might be present and confirming its absence, maintaining focus on elements observable in the edited image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the elemental type label (e.g., Mystic, Stone) visible near the creature and styled to match the overall fantasy aesthetic without appearing digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any visible indicators of an elemental type label near the building or its surroundings when examining the visual information thoroughly. Signs of labeling styled within the fantasy aesthetic are absent, meaning an analysis shows continuity in visual textures without any text elements. The reasoning process includes judging areas where label placement might be logical and determining the lack thereof.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature’s surface display smooth shading and consistent texture across all architectural elements, with no visible pixelation, blurring, or unnatural color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a rich and consistent texture across the architectural elements spread evenly from the building's facade to the area integrating the orb. The shading demonstrates careful handling to ensure even coloring and textural harmony throughout the image. Evaluating visual cues suggests smooth integration and no signs of pixelation or unnatural color blending. Therefore, reasoning includes utilizing visual elements to verify consistent texture visibility and identifying thorough shading.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the creature’s limbs proportionally sized and structurally connected to the main body in a way that suggests physical stability and logical weight distribution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural elements such as columns resemble limbs of a creature, yet they maintain stability as they support either a building or architectural representation rather than an actual creature. The reasoning includes understanding the architectural analogy as part of the design, with proportional sizes providing stability rather than literal anatomical analysis.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the water reflection accurately mirror the creature, orb, and any nearby text, showing correct orientation and lighting without warping or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon closer inspection of Image B, the water reflection captures the orb and building with precise attention to orientation and lighting. Visual cues suggest the presence of an accurate reflection without distortions or ghosting effects. Using local ambient light casts the reflection evenly, indicating deliberate mirroring consistent with the main structure. Therefore, reasoning includes visual confirmation of correct alignment and reflection integrity noted through the reflection's details.",
