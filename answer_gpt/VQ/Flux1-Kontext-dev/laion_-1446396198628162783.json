    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the newly added mission control elements (such as consoles, screens, or panels) geometrically consistent with the room's perspective and do not appear to float or clip through surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible mission control elements such as consoles, screens, or panels added. The focus is primarily on the infographic elements like text boxes and icons. Therefore, the question about the geometric consistency of mission control elements is not applicable in this context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the color-coded sections for training stages (e.g., Physical Training, Technical Skills) have clean edges and are they positioned so they do not overlap or obscure the astronaut’s suit or feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color-coded sections are positioned around the astronaut, framing the suit without overlapping or obscuring it. The edges of the sections are clean and neatly integrated into the design.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the illustrative icons (e.g., treadmill, simulator) proportionally sized and placed at appropriate distances from the astronaut so they do not appear oversized or misplaced in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrative icons are supplementary and placed at appropriate distances from the astronaut. They are proportionally sized to fit within the design without appearing oversized or awkwardly placed.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the explanatory text for each training stage clearly readable, properly aligned, and not overlapping with the astronaut’s body or suit components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is positioned in separate boxes corresponding to each training stage. It is readable and aligns properly without overlapping the astronaut’s body or suit components.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the astronaut’s suit joints (e.g., elbows, knees), gloves, and helmet fully intact with no visible distortion, warping, or missing texture details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The astronaut’s suit in Image B appears intact with no visible distortion or warping. The joints, gloves, and helmet maintain consistent texture details without any noticeable flaws.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the added mission control elements (e.g., consoles, icons) align with the direction of the original ceiling lighting and do not contradict the existing shadow patterns on the floor and astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no added mission control elements, such as consoles, that affect shadow patterns. The infographic elements like text boxes and icons have no shadow implication that contradicts the existing lighting and shadows.",
