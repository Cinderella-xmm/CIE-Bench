      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D soccer player appear to blend seamlessly with the realistic soccer field and stadium without any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized, chibi version of a soccer player, which contrasts with the realistic soccer field, stadium, and crowd. Typically, chibi-style characteristics include disproportionate body features such as a larger head, which inherently differentiate from realistic textures and structures. The seamless blending is affected due to this stylistic choice making the character stand out against the realistic background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the soccer field, stadium, and cheering crowd still visually plausible and structurally coherent, without any distortions or unnatural textures introduced by the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer field, stadium, and crowd maintain their realistic, detailed appearance which is similar to Image A. The editing focused on the player, not on the background elements, keeping these features coherent and plausible with no noticeable distortions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D soccer player maintain proper proportions and physical logic, avoiding any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style 3D character maintains proportions consistent with the chibi design, such as comparatively larger head size. This design is intentional and does not include any visible geometric distortions or broken shapes, adhering to the logical structure of chibi styling.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the chibi-style 3D soccer player look natural and free of any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style player in Image B utilizes simplified textures which are characteristic of chibi designs. While these differ from real-life textures, they are consistent with the styling norms and do not present unnatural artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the action pose of the chibi-style 3D soccer player consistent with the original image, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style player mimics a similar action pose as in Image A, with adjustments for stylization. Despite stylistic differences, the posing remains credible and consistent in context, reflecting the intended motion structure.",
