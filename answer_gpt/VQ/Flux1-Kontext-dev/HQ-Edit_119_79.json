      "question": "Does the cat’s body maintain the original shape and proportions when transformed into quartz and obsidian crystals, with no visible warping or unnatural breaks in form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the visual cues in Image B reveals that the cat's body shape and proportions have been transformed into a crystalline form consisting of quartz and obsidian. The crystal layering preserves the overall dimensions and curvature seen in the original fur-covered cat in Image A. Despite the change in texture, the shape adheres to the original form closely, with no visible warping or unnatural breaks. This indicates an intentional design to maintain the proportions while changing materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the emerald crystal eyes positioned correctly within the eye sockets, showing consistent size, shape, and reflective qualities that match the original facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Though Image B features a blurred face, the sloped edges and reflection patterns of the emerald-cut crystals indicate they are in the appropriate position where the eyes should be, maintaining the size and shape consistent with the original expression seen in Image A. The reflective qualities shown in the image align with world knowledge of gemstone properties, mimicking the eye's brightness and detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cat’s front paws and hind legs properly positioned on the wooden block, with no floating or disconnected segments that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The observation of Image B shows that the crystalline paws are placed firmly on the wooden block, with the hind legs visible similarly as in Image A. The paws' alignment corresponds correctly with the original positioning, showing no signs of floating or misalignment. The adherence to the original physical logic suggests proper positioning of the limbs on the surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the quartz and obsidian surfaces display realistic textures with natural variations in translucency, shading, and edge definition, without pixelation or unnatural smoothness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfaces in Image B depict realistic textures with variations like translucency seen in quartz and edge definition characteristic of cut obsidian, revealing smooth yet detailed facets. There is an absence of pixelation, and the textures preserve a natural crystalline feeling. These qualities demonstrate world knowledge in gemstone textures.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden block visually consistent with the original image in terms of texture, color, and lighting, and does it cast appropriate shadows under the crystal cat without unnatural gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a wooden block that retains the same texture, color consistency, and lighting as seen in Image A. Close inspection shows shadows cast under the crystal cat, congruent with the logical positioning of light sources, without any unnatural gaps or distortions. This indicates consistent visual representation with Image A's environment.",
