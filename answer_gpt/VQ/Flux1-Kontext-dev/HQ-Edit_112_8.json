      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the text 'Stories Through Time' rendered in a serif font with a distressed gold texture that matches the typewriter’s material and color tone, and does it appear seamlessly integrated into the image without overlapping or obscuring key objects like the typewriter or lamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Stories Through' is styled in a serif font with a color tone that matches the typewriter's material, appearing gold and slightly distressed, which complements the vintage feel of the image. The text is positioned near the top of the image, ensuring it does not overlap or obscure key elements like the typewriter or the lamp. The integration looks seamless due to the consistent color tone and careful placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the sepia filter apply evenly across all elements—such as the wooden desk, typewriter, lamp, and wall—without causing uneven color shifts, loss of texture detail, or artificial flattening of shadows and highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a sepia filter is applied over the entire image, providing a cohesive vintage tone to elements like the desk, typewriter, lamp, and wall. The shadows and highlights retain their depth and texture detail, indicating that the filter has been applied evenly without diminishing the visual richness or creating unnatural color shifts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ghostly pages positioned around the typewriter in a flowing, semi-transparent manner, avoiding sharp edges or unnatural overlaps with solid objects like the typewriter body or desk surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, ghostly pages are depicted with a flowing, ethereal appearance around the typewriter. They are semi-transparent, allowing the background and underlying elements to be faintly visible through them. The edges of these pages are smooth and blend naturally into the scene, without covering or sharply overlapping solid objects like the typewriter or desk.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Art Deco border present along the edges of the image, featuring symmetrical geometric patterns and consistent thickness, without cutting into or distorting any central elements like the typewriter or lamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an Art Deco border runs along the edges, characterized by symmetrical geometric patterns consistent in thickness throughout its length. It frames the image neatly, not intruding upon or distorting central elements like the typewriter or lamp, highlighting these features without breaking the balance of the design.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the typewriter retain its original shape, alignment of keys, and mechanical structure without visible deformation, stretching, or broken geometry despite the addition of new elements like text and ghostly pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typewriter in Image B maintains its original shape, with keys properly aligned and mechanical structures intact, following the addition of other elements like the text and ghostly pages. There is no visible deformation or stretching affecting its geometry, preserving the object's integrity and realistic portrayal within the composition.",
