    "Question": "Q1: Does the kernel wearing autumn attire maintain consistent size and texture with real corn kernels, and does the clothing appear seamlessly integrated without visible edges or texture mismatches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the kernel is depicted wearing autumn-themed attire. To assess if it maintains a consistent size and texture with real corn kernels, I observe the relative scale and visual appearance compared to known dimensions of corn kernels. The attire appears cartoonish and part of the character design, so it is unlikely intended to match real kernel textures. No visible edges or mismatched textures are noticed in the integration of attire, implying a seamless design.",

    "Question": "Q4: Do the popcorn pieces entering the ceramic bowls follow a downward trajectory consistent with gravity, and do they remain within the bowl boundaries without appearing to float above or clip through the rim?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, popcorn pieces are illustrated entering bowls with an animated touch but still adhere to a logical path downwards. They settle within the bowls naturally and do not float above or breach the rim's boundaries. This gives a sense of gravity despite the exaggerated art style, reflecting attention to spatial cues.",
