      "question": "Does the metallic, multifaceted eye cluster derived from the NXP module appear structurally consistent with the original module's shape and size, without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cyborg beetle displays a metallic, multifaceted eye cluster designed to represent the transformation of the NXP module. Analyzing the structure, the size resembles the NXP module's proportions closely, and there are no apparent distortions or unnatural textures noticed in the transition from module to eye cluster.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bioluminescent spots created from the solder points on the green circuit board visually plausible and detailed, without breaking the original geometric shapes or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cyborg beetle features bioluminescent spots that mimic the position of solder points on the original circuit board. These spots maintain consistent geometric forms and there are no obvious visual artifacts disrupting their appearance, making the transformation visually plausible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the glowing wing veins evolved from the circuit board's traces maintain a natural appearance and retain fine details, without introducing unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings of the cyborg beetle, designed with glowing veins, suggest a transformation from the circuit boardâ€™s complex traces. These veins appear articulated with clear, internal patterns, maintaining a natural appearance akin to insect wings, without any unusual textures or visible artifacts.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the overall composition and layout of the cyborg beetle, formed by blending the NXP module and the green circuit board, visually credible and structurally consistent, without introducing distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cyborg beetle, created by integrating the NXP module and the green circuit board components, presents a cohesive and visually credible layout. The parts connect seamlessly, ensuring structural consistency, and lack any perceptible distortions or artifacts, making the transformation appear believable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the neutral background remain unchanged and free of artifacts after the transformation of the NXP module and the green circuit board into the cyborg beetle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in the image retains a smooth, neutral tone that is unaffected by the insertion of the cyborg beetle. There are no visual disruptions or artifacts visible in the backdrop, signaling that it has remained unchanged throughout the transformation process.",
