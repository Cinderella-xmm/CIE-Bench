      "question": "Does the chibi-style elephant maintain its identifiable traits like tusks and large ears without any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant depicted on the cereal box retains identifiable traits such as long tusks and large ears, which are signature features of real elephants. The depiction, however, is stylized to fit a packaging design, similar to many logo or mascot representations aiming for an appealing and charming appearance, keeping recognizable elements intact.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and fine details of the elephant's skin accurately represented in the chibi-style 3D rendering without any loss or unnatural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is depicted on the cereal box, implying a graphic representation rather than a 3D model requiring detailed texture work. The textures suitable for a printed illustration, like those on packaging, do not show detailed skin textures but maintain an accurate stylized representation coherent with traditional illustration techniques.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cereal box in Image B showcases earthy hues such as brown and greens, alongside an organic illustration of an elephant carrying the globe. Such color choices are visually harmonious with environmental themes, often using muted and natural tones to invoke a sense of nature and earthiness, fitting well with ecological packaging designs.",

      "question": "Does the chosen environment (rustic kitchen countertop or market stall) complement the cereal box and chibi elephant mascot without any visual inconsistencies or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B places the cereal box on a wooden surface, surrounded by natural elements like seeds and fruit. This choice of environment complements the cereal box and its organic theme, exhibiting consistency in styling without any visual disruptions or mismatches between the box and the setting reminiscent of a natural, rustic market stall.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the cereal box and the elements in the environment such as seeds and fruits are well-maintained. The perceived size and positioning of the elephant globe illustration, rendered on the box, maintains visual logic typical for such arts, fitting well within the context of packaging design stipulations. No apparent distortions affect physical rationality within the setting.",
