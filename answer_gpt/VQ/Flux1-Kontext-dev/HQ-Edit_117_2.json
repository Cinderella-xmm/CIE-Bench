      "question": "Do the embossed tribal patterns on the ceramic pots maintain consistent texture and depth with the original material, without visible artifacts such as floating lines or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceramic pots visible in the first postcard vignette appear to feature detailed and consistent embossed tribal patterns. The designs on the pots maintain the depth and texture expected of such materials, with no visible signs of artifacts like floating lines or distortion in geometry. This suggests an understanding of how traditional pottery would look and feel, reflecting accurate cultural representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the expanded motifs on the dress proportionally consistent with the garment’s structure, and do they avoid unnatural stretching or breaking of fabric lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motifs on the dress of the woman shown exhibit cohesion with the garment's structure, showing no signs of proportional distortion. The patterns sit well on the fabric, maintaining a natural flow of lines and avoiding any strange stretching or misalignment. This suggests a careful alignment of the dress design with the form of the garment.",

      "question": "Do the transformed bread and cucumber retain recognizable forms as food items while incorporating character features, without unnatural deformations or texture inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bread and cucumber have been artistically transformed in the vignettes but still retain their recognizable forms as food items. The bread is depicted in a cartoonish style in one of the postcards yet remains identifiable. There are no visible issues with the textural continuity or shape recognition that would suggest deformation or inconsistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the boundaries of each postcard vignette cleanly separated from the original image without cutting off elements or introducing edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays multiple postcard-style vignettes. These are cleanly defined with borders that do not cut off any intended elements, indicating a clear separation from the original image. There are no visible edge artifacts between the boundaries, signifying an intentional and precise editing process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the woman’s right hand (visible near the stove) have five fingers with natural proportions and positioning, and does it cast a shadow consistent with the light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s right hand positioned near the stove displays five fingers, each with proper and natural proportions and gestures. It is well-lit and casts a shadow consistent with the other elements in the image, matching the primary light source within the room. This suggests accuracy in depicting the human form and interaction with lighting.",
