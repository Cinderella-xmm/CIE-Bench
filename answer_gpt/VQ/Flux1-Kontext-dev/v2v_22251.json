        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blazer and T-shirt appear to be consistent with the modern style rather than reflecting a renaissance aesthetic.

Thus, there isn’t an introduction of unnatural textures, but it does not align with a Renaissance aesthetic.",
