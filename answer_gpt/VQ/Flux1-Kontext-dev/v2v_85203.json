      "question": "Does the butterfly maintain its structural integrity without any unnatural textures or artifacts after being reinterpreted as a dynamic vortex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly retains its original structural features—including the shape, color, and details of its wings—without introducing any unnatural textures or visual artifacts. The depiction of the wings and body is clear and detailed, consistent with real butterflies, despite being presented within a dynamic vortex environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the faint trails of light behind the butterfly's wings seamlessly integrated and do not introduce any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faint trails of light are well integrated with the butterfly, enhancing the visual appeal without adding any visible artifacts. The lighting effects appear smooth and natural, complementing the butterfly’s appearance and enhancing the mystical atmosphere without compromising the image quality.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dark lower mass convincingly represent a chasm of fractured, glossy obsidian without any visible distortion or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the dark lower region as a dynamic chasm, characterized by fractured surfaces that resemble the glossy appearance of obsidian. The representation is convincing, with the chasm's texture and structure appearing natural without any visible distortions or anomalies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the mystical, nebulous atmosphere been added without degrading the fine details of the butterfly and the chasm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the introduction of a mystical, nebulous atmosphere enhances the scene without compromising the fine details of the butterfly or the chasm. The butterfly maintains its intricate wing detail, and the chasm retains its clear, structured appearance, both harmoniously integrated within the atmosphere.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B successfully creates a coherent narrative where the butterfly and the chasm coexist naturally within a dynamic vortex environment. The elements are visually consistent, supporting the fantastical theme, and merging seamlessly to form a plausible scene.",
