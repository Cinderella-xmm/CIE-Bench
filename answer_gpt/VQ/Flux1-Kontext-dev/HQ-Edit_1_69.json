    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the red dress maintain natural fabric folds and surface texture despite increased saturation and bold outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a red dress with increased saturation, resulting in deeper color intensity and bold outlines that accentuate the form. The natural fabric folds and texture can still be discerned, suggesting that while saturation and outlines are emphasized, the dress's inherent characteristics are preserved.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the woman’s leg and arm positions consistent with natural human biomechanics during a walking motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering the edited image, the woman's posture and stride reflect a typical walking motion, with the left leg slightly forward and an opposing arm movement. These positions align with natural human biomechanics during walking, demonstrating a realistic depiction of motion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black slipcase visually integrated into the scene with consistent lighting and shadow direction relative to the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black slipcase contrasts with the ambient lighting of the surrounding environment in the edited image. It appears as a separate graphic element, creating a dissonant visual cue rather than being integrated with consistent environmental lighting and shadow direction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bold outlines around the woman’s body follow the natural contours of her shape without creating gaps or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the bold outlines trace the contours of the woman's body in a manner that is smooth and adheres to her natural shape. There are no visible gaps or incorrect overlaps, suggesting precision in maintaining the integrity of her form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the woman’s right hand have five fingers with natural proportions and smooth skin texture, without deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman’s right hand is depicted with five fingers that are proportionate and properly shaped. The skin texture appears smooth, with no visual cues of deformation or additional digits, maintaining natural anatomy.",
