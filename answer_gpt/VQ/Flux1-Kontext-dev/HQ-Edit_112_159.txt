    "Question": "Q1: Is the glass display case surrounding the car and road clearly defined with smooth edges, proper transparency, and no floating or misaligned sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case appears well-defined with distinct edges and corners. The glass has proper transparency, as the car and road inside the case are visible without distortion. The structure of the case is consistent, with no sections seeming out of place, suggesting it is properly aligned.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Does the carâ€™s surface exhibit consistent metallic red coloring with smooth gradient transitions and preserved sharp detail lines along the body panels?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the car's surface maintains a consistent metallic red coloring. The gradients are smooth, transitioning seamlessly between different shades of red which is a typical characteristic of a well-rendered metallic surface. Detail lines along the body panels are sharp and well-preserved, contributing to the realistic depiction of the car's design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the resin layers in the road and cliff areas visibly distinct with gradual transparency and depth cues, avoiding flat or uniformly colored sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable depth and layering in the road and cliff areas. This is achieved through varying levels of transparency and texture, making these sections appear dynamic rather than flat or overly uniform. Each layer seems to contribute to a coherent representation of depth and distance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the micro gravel texture evenly distributed across the road and cliff surfaces, with natural variation in size and no repetitive or artificial patterns?",
    "explanation": "Image B appears to showcase a natural distribution of micro gravel texture over the road and cliff surfaces. This texture has a varied size and does not follow any repetitive or overly artificial patterns, which contributes to a more realistic depiction of these surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the sunset sky panel blend smoothly with the original sky, maintaining consistent color gradients and horizon alignment without visible seams or clipping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sunset sky panel is integrated seamlessly with the existing sky. This blend preserves consistent color gradients across the sky and maintains proper horizon alignment. There are no obvious seams or issues with clipping, indicating a smooth integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the proportions of the car, road, cliffs, and display case consistent with a miniature scale, avoiding exaggerated or unrealistic sizing relationships?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions between the car, road, cliffs, and display case appear to be consistent with a miniature scale. The sizing relationships are realistic, ensuring that none of the elements are exaggerated in size compared to each other. This harmony in proportions helps maintain the validity of the miniature representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
