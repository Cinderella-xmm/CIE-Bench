      "question": "Does the transition from the snowy mountain background to the tropical beach setting appear seamless and free of unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skier is against a tropical beach background with palm trees and a wave, a stark contrast to typical snowy mountain settings, creating a surreal and fantastical depiction. The transition introduces a visual contrast in textures—the snow being replaced by water, typically disparate in visual appearance. Despite the creative merge of elements, there are no glaring unnatural artifacts or textures indicating a low-quality edit between the skier and beach context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the skier's posture and equipment seamlessly transformed into those of a surfer, maintaining natural appearance and avoiding distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skier maintains the same posture and equipment as in Image A, with no transformation to surfing posture or equipment—apart from altering the background. The pose of bending slightly forward and holding poles remains unchanged, which would be uncommon and unrealistic for surfing. This results in a lack of alignment with typical surfing posture and environment, indicating some distortion in terms of activity congruence.",

      "question": "Do the surfboards look natural and detailed, matching the quality and texture expected in a tropical beach setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skis in Image B are retained from Image A, yet painted red rather than completely transforming into surfboards typically found in tropical beach settings. Surfboards differ from skis in shape, finishing having glossy and hydrodynamic designs, whereas skis are slender and flat-designed for snow, not water, contributing some artificiality to the beach scene.",

      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows in the tropical beach setting consistent with the new environment, contributing to a natural and authentic appearance?",

      "question": "Does the skier's clothing and gear appear appropriate for surfing, maintaining structural consistency and avoiding unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skier retains the same skiing apparel—a heavy jacket, gloves, and helmet—typical for cold climates and inappropriate for a tropical beach scenario where lighter, water-resistant materials are the norm. This mismatch in clothing results in unnaturalness in context consistency despite structural quality remaining intact.",
