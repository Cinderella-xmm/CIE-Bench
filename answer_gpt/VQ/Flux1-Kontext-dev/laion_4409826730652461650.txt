    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes and mouth of the horse in both panels correctly positioned and proportionally consistent with the original plush design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's eyes and mouth are designed cartoonishly but maintain consistency in positioning relative to a horse's facial structure. The eyes are large and animated, typical of stylized illustrations, and the mouth is highlighted with a smile. In Image A, the plush horse features realistic plush elements, with proportionate eyes and a simplified mouth typical of a toy. Comparing the two, while the styles differ, the relative positions maintain their proportional essence, fulfilling the design intention while adapting to a cartoon style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the lasso above the horse's head shaped naturally and positioned so that it appears to be twirling in mid-air without intersecting or clipping through the horse's body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lasso is depicted in a characteristic loop above the horse's head, with a natural bend as it would be if twirling. It is drawn in such a way that it remains suspended above the horse, without intersecting its body parts, enhancing the sense of dynamic movement typical in cartoon adventures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the cacti and wooden saloon buildings in the background align with the horizon line and cast shadows consistent with the light source direction?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cacti and saloon buildings are placed against a blue sky with a low horizon. Shadows aren't overtly present in the image, perhaps due to the stylized nature of cartoons which often omit this for clarity. The objects appear consistent with typical perspective lines, implying proper alignment despite a lack of explicit shadowing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the fur texture of the horse and the plastic details of the rocking base clearly visible and not blurred or oversimplified due to stylization?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's fur texture is simplified into a smooth, flat color, typical of cartoon art, lacking the fuzzy detail of the plush from Image A. Similarly, the rocking base in Image B omits the detailed plastic texturing for a stylized appearance. The changes reflect a deliberate style choice for animation aesthetics rather than blur or oversight.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the text “Wild, Wild Horse Adventures!” positioned at the top of the image without overlapping any part of the horse or background elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text present is “TWXVFY, MOINSE ADVENTURES,” which is stylized and bold at the top, but it does not overlap with the horse or key elements in the panels, leaving these areas clear for visual focus.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the legs and rocking base of the horse proportionally accurate and aligned with the original mechanical structure, even after stylization?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's legs and rocking base are cartoonish yet follow the basic structure of the original seen in Image A. The proportions and presence of a rocker with wheels parallel the real toy, despite the cartoon's stylized representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
