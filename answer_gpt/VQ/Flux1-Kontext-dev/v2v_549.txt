    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi-style Funko Pop figure maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the baseball player's pose and attire without introducing unnatural distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure has exaggerated proportions typical of chibi-style design, such as a large head and shorter limbs. While this differs from realistic human proportions, it is consistent with the common aesthetic of Funko Pop figures, which are designed intentionally to have a stylized and disproportionate appearance. The pose of the figure holding a bat is typical for a baseball player, even if exaggerated for effect. Thus, within the context of Funko Pop design, the proportions and pose are appropriate.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the detailed textures and lighting of the realistic depiction of the figure outside the box natural and consistent with the lighting and textures in the original image?",
    "explanation": "The image uses a stylized Funko Pop figure which typically features smooth surfaces and simple textures without fine detailing found in a realistic figure. The lighting in Image B appears consistent within the context of the image, as the lighting seems uniform for the entire scene, matching the neutral background. The textures are intentionally simplified, consistent with typical Funko Pop figures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there an absence of unnatural textures or loss of fine details where the chibi-style figure transitions to the realistic depiction of the figure outside the box?",
    "explanation": "The transition between the chibi-style figure and the realistic depiction outside the box is consistent with the Funko Pop aesthetic, which typically exhibits smooth, simple textures rather than realistic detail. The chibi figure and real depiction don't require fine details typically present in realistic figures, so their transitions alongside the box design don't lose any detail expected in this stylized depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the Funko Pop-style box and its elements (ball, glove, title) integrate naturally with the overall scene without disrupting the visual credibility?",
    "explanation": "The Funko Pop-style box and its elements are designed to fit within the context of the image, consistent with the packaging of collectible figures. The box design, elements like the baseball and glove, and the title, are placed coherently and align with displayed figure styles. The style and arrangement of the box complement the aesthetic of the scene without disrupting it.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the isometric view of the Funko Pop-style box preserve the structural integrity and avoid any broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "The Funko Pop-style box in Image B is shown with clean lines and correct geometric shapes typical for a rectangular product box. The box maintains structural integrity, and there are no visible distortions or breaks in its shape indicating faulty geometry; even at this perspective, the shapes appear visually coherent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
