      "question": "Does the transformed lantern maintain its original symmetrical shape and geometric proportions without visible distortion or broken lattice patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lantern hanging above the flame maintains a smooth, symmetrical shape. The lattice patterns appear intact, with no visible distortions, maintaining a consistent geometric proportion similar to the original design. This suggests that the lantern's transformation process preserved its structure effectively.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the lantern with a central flame element, integrated without disrupting the lantern's surface.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging design incorporates motifs inspired by the original marketplace scene. While specific marketplace elements are not explicitly visible on the box, the intricate patterns on the packaging borders are inspired by similar visual motifs, stylized to fit within the overall theme without distortion or loss of detail, providing a coherent transformation of elements.",

      "question": "Do the deep gold and amber tones applied to the packaging blend naturally with the existing lighting and material colors, avoiding harsh transitions or unnatural glow effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B is comprised of deep gold and amber tones that complement the lantern's metallic hues, creating a cohesive visual effect. The blending of colors is smooth, and transitions between tones are natural, supported by ambient lighting, avoiding any harsh or glaring effects, thus ensuring a unified aesthetic.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the candle silhouette centrally positioned on the packaging front, with proportions that are balanced relative to other design elements such as the lantern and decorative borders. There are no visual artifacts disrupting the layout, confirming its correct alignment and integration within the design.",
