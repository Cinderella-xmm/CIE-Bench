      "question": "Does the transparent glass material retain the denim blue tint without unnatural color bleeding or inconsistent opacity across the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is designed to resemble a bottle but with features of denim jeans, specifically the color and texture. The glass material of the object has a consistent blue hue, which is similar to a denim tint. There are no areas that show inconsistent opacity; the glass material uniformly retains its denim-like color without bleeding outside its boundaries, and it appears coherent and smooth throughout.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the embossed metallic branding elements positioned correctly over the original back pocket area without distorting the surrounding fabric or creating visible seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic branding is located near the top of the object, simulating the branding position often seen on perfume bottles rather than pockets on jeans. Since there is no depiction of pockets in the glass material, the question's context seems to imply verification in a non-applicable area. Hence, there is no distortion or seams present as there are no original denim pockets to compare.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the silver button-shaped cap properly aligned with the waistband and securely attached without gaps or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silver cap at the top of the bottle appears to be well-aligned with the overall structure. The cap resembles a standard perfume bottle cap and sits flush without any visible gaps or signs of it floating unnaturally. It is securely attached, which maintains the visual integrity and realism of the bottle design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the lace-up details on both legs have symmetrical threading and bow knots that follow the natural curve of the leg without distortion or clipping through the fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lace-up details are present on both sides of the flared leg sections, paralleling the design on the denim jeans in Image A. The threading and bow knots are symmetrical and follow the curve of the bottle's leg-like shape naturally. There is no noticeable distortion or clipping through the ‘fabric’, as the details are integrated smoothly into the glass surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the flared leg section maintain smooth, continuous curvature without sharp breaks, pixelation, or stretched textures indicating geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flared sections of the bottle are analogous to the flare on denim jeans. These sections maintain a smooth and continuous curvature, free from sharp breaks or pixelation. There are no signs of stretched textures or geometric distortions that would disrupt the fluid design, preserving the illusion of fabric in the glass material.",
