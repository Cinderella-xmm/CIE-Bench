      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the brass and copper elements on the uniform show natural surface variations, such as subtle scratches, patina, and reflective highlights, without appearing uniformly smooth or unnaturally glossy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brass and copper elements on the uniform in Image B exhibit natural variations that are characteristic of these materials. The elements do not appear uniformly smooth; instead, they reflect light in a way that suggests textured surfaces, potentially indicating patina or subtle scratches that are typical of metallic finishes. This analysis is supported by the typical properties of brass and copper, which often display these variations due to their interaction with environmental factors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gear components on the uniform properly embedded within the fabric structure, maintaining consistent depth and avoiding overlapping or misaligned teeth that break geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gear components in Image B appear to be properly embedded within the uniform's fabric, maintaining consistent depth. The visual arrangement shows geometric continuity with aligned teeth and no noticeable overlaps or misalignment. The proper alignment and embedding ensure that the mechanical aesthetic is preserved, which is important for maintaining the integrity and theme of the attire.",

      "question": "Does the mechanical throne have visible support structures and grounding that prevent it from appearing suspended or unstable, with all cogwheels and braces attached logically to the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical throne is depicted with visible support structures that provide a stable appearance. The cogwheels and braces are logically attached to the frame, which suggests a coherent support system. The throne does not appear suspended or unstable, as the presence of these mechanical components provides a grounded and structurally sound representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the copper, brown, and dark green hues distributed evenly across the uniform, throne, and background, with transitions between colors following natural lighting gradients and avoiding abrupt or patchy changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The distribution of copper, brown, and dark green hues in Image B is even across the elements of the image. The transitions between colors follow natural lighting gradients, which suggests a well-composed color scheme. There are no abrupt or patchy changes, as the colors blend coherently, contributing to a unified and harmonious visual presentation.",

      "question": "Do the steam trails in the background have gradual opacity and wispy edges, flowing naturally from potential sources like vents or machinery, without sharp outlines or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam trails in the background of Image B exhibit gradual opacity and wispy edges, which are characteristic of steam in a natural state. The trails appear to flow naturally and do not have sharp outlines or any signs of pixelation. They seem to emerge from potential sources, which aligns with common depictions of steam within industrial contexts.",

      "question": "Do both hands display five fingers with proper spacing and curvature, and are the knuckles and fingernails rendered with natural detail, without any fused, missing, or duplicated digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands are shown displaying five fingers with proper spacing and curvature. The depiction includes natural details such as knuckles and fingernails, which are rendered realistically. There are no fused, missing, or duplicated digits, indicating accurate representation and attention to anatomical correctness.",
