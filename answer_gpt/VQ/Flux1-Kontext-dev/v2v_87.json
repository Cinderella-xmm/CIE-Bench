      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or artifacts visible on the elephant figure within the transparent glass cube?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "To answer this question, I focus on the elephant figure within the transparent glass cube of Image B. The elephant's texture should mimic authentic elephant skin, which is typically rough and wrinkled. Analyzing the visual cues, I note that there are no apparent digital artifacts or unnatural textures on the elephant figure that would suggest editing mistakes—its skin maintains a natural appearance consistent with a realistic portrayal of an elephant.",

      "question": "Do the proportions and physical rationality of the elephant and minifigure appear consistent and undistorted within the transparent glass cube?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, assessing the proportions involves observing the size and shape of both the elephant and the red backpack within the transparent glass cube. An elephant is significantly larger than a backpack, and Image B seems to depict this proportionality accurately. The items appear undistorted and well in scale with one another based on real-world expectations.",

      "question": "Have the fine details of the elephant's skin texture and the backpack's material been preserved without any loss or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B for the clarity of texture on both the elephant's skin and the backpack, I observe that the rough, wrinkled texture of the elephant’s skin is depicted with high detail, as is the fabric-like texture of the backpack. Both maintain their expected details without visible distortion or blurring, indicating that the image editing preserved these fine details.",

      "question": "Does the color palette of the elephant and the rich red tone of the backpack blend naturally with the desert-inspired interior without any jarring contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Studying the color palette in Image B, the elephant's natural earthy tones complement the sandy tones of the background. The backpack's rich red color, while distinct, doesn't clash harshly with the overall desert theme, suggesting an intentional contrast. The colors blend in a manner that feels coordinated and deliberate, avoiding any jarring contrasts.",

      "question": "Is the composition and layout of the elements within the transparent glass cube, including the elephant, minifigure, and engraved nameplate, visually credible and well-balanced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the elephant, backpack, and nameplate inside the glass cube is evaluated for balance and credibility. The elephant and backpack are centered, creating a visually appealing composition. The nameplate is clear and appropriately placed under the display, providing context without overwhelming the image. This balanced layout establishes a coherent scene.",
