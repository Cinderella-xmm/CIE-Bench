      "question": "Do the man's limbs and torso maintain proportional relationships and natural joint articulation despite stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's limbs and torso are presented with a degree of stylization due to the editing to make it look like a cut-out on a postal stamp. Despite this artistic representation, the man's limbs and torso maintain their realistic proportions and natural joint articulation. This is visible by observing the natural bending of the man's arm and the consistent proportions of the torso to the limbs, indicating that the stylization does not distort the natural anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the tuxedo and fur jacket rendered with sufficient detail and depth to appear physically plausible despite stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures of both the tuxedo and fur jacket are maintained with high detail, contributing to a realistic appearance even when styled as a stamp. The tuxedo retains its tailored lines and smooth surface, while the fur jacket shows a texture indicative of real fur, with shading and highlights that suggest depth. This is critical for the visual plausibility of the clothing in such stylized formats.",

      "question": "Are the FIA logo and sponsor names clearly visible and correctly formed within the simplified linear background design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the FIA logo and sponsor names are clearly visible, maintaining correct typography and layout within the designed background. The logo in the center is easily legible and retains the standard design characteristics. Likewise, the sponsor names stand out against the blue background, adhering to the clarity expected in official presentations.",

      "question": "Is the gold ribbon-like border fully closed, evenly shaped, and consistently thick around the entire perimeter of the stamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold ribbon-like border around the perimeter of the stamp is fully closed and maintains a consistent shape and thickness. It frames the central image appropriately and symmetrically, demonstrating careful attention to design and detail to ensure it encloses the image seamlessly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the embossed logo on the blue envelope show consistent depth, soft shadows, and surface texture without appearing flat or artificially rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The embossed logo on the blue envelope in Image B shows depth through shading and highlights consistent with the surrounding envelope. The subtle shadows and variations in the surface suggest a physical texture that aligns with realistic embossing. This helps in maintaining the three-dimensional appearance rather than leaving it flatly rendered.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the stamp positioned with appropriate shadowing and perspective to appear physically attached to the envelope surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stamp is positioned in a way that the shadowing underneath adds to the perception of depth, making it seem like it physically adheres to the surface of the envelope. The perspective alignment with the envelope's surface aids in creating a realistic appearance of attachment.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question": "Do both individuals have exactly five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no deformation or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon closely observing Image B, both individuals exhibit hands with natural shapes, each featuring exactly five fingers. The depiction of hands maintains realistic anatomical structure without any sign of deformation or missing digits, ensuring that the artistic stylization does not interfere with the natural rendering of body parts.",
