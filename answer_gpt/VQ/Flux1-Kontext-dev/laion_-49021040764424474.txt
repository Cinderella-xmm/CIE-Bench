    "Question": "Q1: Are the orange, black, and silver sections of the truck's body composed of clearly defined LEGO brick patterns with uniform size and alignment, avoiding blurred or inconsistent textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck's body shows a clear LEGO brick pattern. LEGO pieces typically have uniform sizes and alignment, contributing to a consistent texture. The visual inspection reveals no blurred or inconsistent textures, as the LEGO bricks follow a consistent pattern. Knowledge of LEGO construction suggests that properly assembled LEGO models have defined brick patterns without blurring.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the wheels consist of circular gray LEGO-style pieces with correct proportions and no deformation, maintaining a solid geometric structure without jagged edges or distorted shapes?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays wheels made of circular gray LEGO-style pieces with accurate proportions, resembling LEGO tires. The edges are solid without jagged or distorted shapes, which aligns with the precision typical of LEGO wheel construction. Understanding LEGO design principles indicates that wheels maintain geometric integrity, ensuring correct proportions and smooth edges.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth, flat black LEGO tiles arranged in a regular grid pattern without gaps, overlaps, or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck bed surface exhibits smooth, flat black tiles typically associated with LEGO construction. These tiles follow a regular grid pattern, indicative of the precision required in LEGO assemblies. The visual inspection shows no gaps, overlaps, or misaligned edges, consistent with the arrangement standards for LEGO sets.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Is the LEGO truck positioned securely on a flat white shelf with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does the shelf extend appropriately beneath the full width of the truck?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO truck placed on a flat white shelf. The truck is securely positioned without any visible gaps or floating effects. The shelf extends under the truck's entire width, providing typical support for a model on display. The stability and alignment are consistent with what is expected when displaying LEGO models on a flat surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all major structural components such as the tailgate, side steps, and bumpers correctly reconstructed in LEGO form with accurate proportions and proper alignment to the rest of the truck body?",
    "explanation": "Image B features the truck's structural components, including the tailgate, side steps, and bumpers, realized in LEGO form. These components appear proportionate and properly aligned with the truck's body. LEGO construction is known for attention to detail in proportions and alignment, helping ensure that individual parts accurately fit the model's overall design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
