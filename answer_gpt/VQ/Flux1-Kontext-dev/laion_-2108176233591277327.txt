    "Question": "Q4: Does the nest-like rim have a layered, organic structure with consistent material texture and properly placed jewel accents that do not appear displaced or floating?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the egg rests in a simulated nest, characterized by its organic texture and layered structure that mimics twigs or woven material. The jewel accent on the rim is well-placed and integrated into the design, appearing naturally embedded rather than floating or displaced. This coherence in textural detail and jeweling indicates careful craftsmanship and design intent.",
