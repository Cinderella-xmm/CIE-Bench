      "question": "Do the vibrant striped and polka dot patterns on the 3D chibi-style ties appear undistorted and maintain their original integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the striped tie maintains its vibrant multicolor pattern with clearly defined lines, and the polka dot tie maintains uniformly spaced dots. Both ties appear visually intact, with patterns undistorted. This suggests that the edited image has preserved the original patterns well. In Image A, these patterns are similarly crisp and undistorted, confirming that Image B retains the integrity of the original design.",

      "question": "Are the 3D chibi-style ties seamlessly integrated into the realistic drawer setting without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties appear to be appropriately positioned within a wooden drawer with no visible signs of artificial placement or graphical artifacts altering their surfaces. The textures of the ties blend naturally with the drawer setting. Image A also shows the ties without such artifacts, indicating successful integration into a realistic background in Image B.",

      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style ties retain proper proportions and physical rationality, ensuring no geometric shapes are broken or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the ties appear consistent and physically rational. There are no observable distortions or breaks in the geometric shapes of the ties, which align well with real-world expectations of ties placed in a drawer. Image A also demonstrates clean and proportionate ties, reinforcing the accuracy shown in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style ties exhibit consistent material properties, such as texture and sheen, similar to their original appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B displays ties with a sheen and texture that mimics fabric, maintaining a consistency reminiscent of their presentation in a real-world context. These materials match the sheen and texture observed in Image A, confirming the consistency of material properties in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the arrangement of the 3D chibi-style ties within the drawer setting adhere to common sense and physical logic, ensuring visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the ties in the drawer follows logical placement commonly seen when ties are stored in drawers, without any physical anomalies. The ties are laid flat and parallel, ensuring credibility and practical organization. Image A presents similar placement logic, affirming the visual credibility in Image B.",
