      "question": "Does the bold black outline fully trace the crocodile's form without breaking or misaligning at joints, scales, or facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bold black outline is a common feature in pop art style, which aims to create a clear and exaggerated form. The outline in Image B successfully traces the crocodile’s contours, including its head, scales, and features such as teeth and snout, without notable breaks or misalignments. The technique and style purposefully emphasize the shapes, which are typically consistent and continuous in pop art, maintaining integrity across the figure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the hat and sunglasses vividly saturated but still preserving visible texture details like knit stitches and lens reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are vividly saturated as part of a pop art design, which prioritizes bold, bright colors for visual impact over texture reproduction. This style does not aim to preserve texture details like knit stitches or reflections realistically. Rather, it focuses on high-contrast color usage, usually foregoing intricacies in texture for an overall striking appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the geometric patterns on the crocodile's skin repeat consistently across the neck, back, and limbs without gaps, overlaps, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns in Image B are stylized to emphasize consistency and uniformity across the crocodile's body, as generally seen in pop art designs. These geometric patterns are expected to repeat uniformly, and in this illustration, they appear consistent, without visible gaps, overlaps, or distortions. This deliberate artistic choice ensures a coherent pattern style across the entire figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the hat, sunglasses, and geometric patterns aligned correctly with the crocodile’s head and body, showing no floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the artistic modifications, the hat and sunglasses are aligned with the crocodile's head, maintaining contact with it. This deliberate alignment in depiction ensures the accessories do not appear floating or detached from the figure, which is crucial for maintaining an intentional and cohesive artistic presentation common in pop art styles. This alignment reflects purposeful positioning of each component within the composition.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crocodile’s facial features, including the snout, teeth, and eye placement, proportionally accurate and undistorted despite the artistic modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a pop art version of the crocodile where the facial features are stylized but still maintain plausible proportions relative to each other and the overall figure. This style embellishes certain characteristics while preserving essential visual accuracy in feature placement such as the snout, teeth, and eyes. Despite artistic enhancements, these features remain coherent and recognizably proportionate.",
