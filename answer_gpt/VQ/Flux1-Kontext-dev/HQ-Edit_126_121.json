      "question": "Are the gorilla's hands holding the bananas with five fingers each, and do the fingers have natural curvature and skin texture without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla's hands holding the bananas appear to have a realistic natural curvature and skin texture. There is no visible deformation in the fingers and they seem to have the usual number of fingers for a gorilla. This observation is made considering typical gorilla anatomy where they have five fingers. The visual depiction matches this anatomical expectation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edge of the cereal box blend naturally with the gorilla and background, without visible seams or lighting discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cereal box where the edges are integrated into the scene. There are no obvious seams or lighting inconsistencies that disrupt the flow from the box to the gorilla and jungle environment. This suggests a well-executed blending without noticeable discontinuities.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the green and yellow colors on the cereal box consistent with the lighting and tone of the jungle environment, without abrupt shifts or oversaturated patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors used on the cereal box are green and yellow, which are harmoniously consistent with the ambient lighting and color palette of the jungle setting. The absence of abrupt or oversaturated patches further indicates that the colors are uniformly applied.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the banana motifs and leaf patterns on the box have realistic shadows and depth, matching the lighting direction of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the banana motifs and leaf patterns on the box exhibit shadows and depth that align well with the lighting direction in the scene. This realism in shadows suggests the motifs are depicted with proper attention to light source direction and depth portrayal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the back panel illustration composed with correct perspective and scale, and is the text clearly readable without covering important parts of the gorilla or bananas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the back panel appears to maintain correct perspective and scale relative to the gorilla and bananas. The text is positioned so it doesn't obscure vital elements like the bananas or gorilla, and is reasonably readable given the arrangement of the other composition elements.",
