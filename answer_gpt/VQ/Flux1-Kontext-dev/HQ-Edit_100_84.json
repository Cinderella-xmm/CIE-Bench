      "question": "Are the added decorative patterns on the dhowâ€™s hull and deck aligned with the wood grain and structural lines, and do they lack jagged edges or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative patterns on the dhow are visibly prominent with intricate designs typical of Middle Eastern art, suggesting an intentional stylistic addition. Without jagged edges or any inconsistency in pattern flow, the details appear harmonious and meticulously crafted to avoid any unnatural texture. In contrast, Image A lacks such decorative embellishments, focusing on the structural simplicity of the dhow's wooden design. These details in Image B are smoothly integrated, complementing the overall artistic theme without distorting the grain or framework of the ship.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the mythical sea creatures near the dhow have smooth contours, realistic scales or skin textures, and proper interaction with the water surface (e.g., ripples, reflections)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sea creatures are stylized in a mythical fashion with distinct outlines, matching the illustrative, fantasy-driven theme. Their smooth contours are evident but, contrary to realistic depictions, lack scales or realistic skin textures, typical of graphic designs in artistic posters. The interaction with the water surface is minimal in terms of creating ripples or reflections, instead appearing part of a flat, decorative element within the artwork. Image A does not feature mythical creatures, focusing solely on the dhow and sea.",

      "question": "Are the blue and gold tones applied consistently across the scene without causing color bleeding, pixelation, or loss of detail in shaded areas of the boat and water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene utilizes vibrant blue and gold hues consistently, reflecting the stylized aesthetic typical of artistic posters. The colors do not bleed into one another, maintaining distinct contrasts that preserve the artwork's clarity and thematic essence. The absence of pixelation and maintained detail in shaded regions of the boat and water underscore the crisp execution aligned with typical illustrative designs where colors are bold and boundaries clear, unlike the subtler gradients in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the distant sailboats rendered as dark, simplified shapes that maintain their boat-like outline and do not merge into the sky or water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, distant sailboats are depicted as simplified, dark silhouettes against the vibrant backdrop, retaining their essential outlines. These shapes avoid merging with the sky or water, due to the clear delineation provided by contrasting hues. This stark separation is key to upholding visual coherence in illustratively-themed artworks. Conversely, Image A presents distant boats in a realistic scene with sunlit reflections, blending subtly without stark contrasts.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the Arabian skyline mirage at the horizon rendered with a soft, shimmering effect that blends with the sky and water, and does it display geometric patterns without sharp edges or solid blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replicates a stylized mirage effect at the horizon with abstract geometric patterns that imply mythical elements, fitting the artistic theme. The horizon is depicted more as an imaginative addition than realistic scenery, relying on artistic gradients to blend seamlessly with the sky and water, thus lacking sharp transitions or solid blocks. Image A portrays a realistic sky without such artistic additions, focusing on natural lighting and environmental transitions.",
