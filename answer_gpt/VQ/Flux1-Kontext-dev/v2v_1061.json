      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the badge maintain the same level of detail and texture as the vibrant domes and intricate patterns of the building, avoiding unnatural textures or loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge shows a miniature representation of the building details from the original image, including vibrant colors and intricate dome patterns typical of Russian architecture, which are depicted in the badge. The badge appears to have a smooth, glossy surface, as indicated by the reflective highlights, suggesting some level of detail preservation. However, due to its small, button-like size, it is challenging for it to fully retain every fine detail of the St. Basil's Cathedral depicted in Image A. Despite this limitation, the badge has effectively captured the prominent features of the building.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes and proportions of the badge consistent with the architectural style of the building, ensuring no distortion or breakage of shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The badge in Image B appears to accurately represent the geometric shapes and proportions of the prominent domes of St. Basil's Cathedral, as seen in Image A. The badge maintains the complex and colorful structure of the building's domes and spires, which are consistent with traditional Russian architecture. Despite being a smaller representation, the architectural form is preserved without noticeable distortion or breakage, aligning with the style and design aesthetics found in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the tassel material of the badge appear soft and flexible, and does the circular form look natural and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tassel attached to the badge appears to be made of a material that is depicted with fine strands, giving a visually soft and flexible appearance, as would be expected from a fabric or similar material. The badge itself maintains a perfectly circular form, indicating that it has not been distorted through editing. This natural and undistorted appearance supports the idea of a well-crafted and realistic representation of a badge.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the badge shows four visible fingers and a thumb, adhering to the anatomical standard of a human hand. The proportions and postures of the fingers conform to ergonomic expectations when holding a circular object such as a badge. The hand looks natural and convincingly integrated into the scene without any anatomical irregularities.",

      "question": "Does the placement of the badge integrate seamlessly into the image, maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility without introducing any artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the badge appears to be naturally held by a hand, suggesting careful placement without visible editing artifacts. The badge's positioning aligns coherently with the visual narrative, depicting it as a handheld item inspired by the original building in Image A. Lighting on the badge matches that of the hand, enhancing the seamless integration into the image. This integration suggests the badge is not only well-embedded but structurally coherent within the scene.",
