      "question": "Does the snow on the clock tower appear naturally accumulated without disrupting the structural integrity of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow is observed on the surfaces and ledges of the clock tower. The icicles hang naturally from edges and architectural details, suggesting snow has accumulated as it would in reality, following gravity and contour lines. Since the tower sustains its form and there's no evidence of structural compromise, the snow appears naturally accumulated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the icy patterns on the flags visually credible and detailed, without introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flags in Image B show snow-covered or frosted textures, similar to such conditions where textiles would accumulate ice and lose some drape or sharp movement. The icy patterns match this concept, not showing unnatural straight lines or digital artifacts. Thus, the textures appear visually credible.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the clock tower retain their natural appearance despite the added snow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main structure of the clock tower, like its walls and architectural features, consistently shows the textures and materials similar to painting style without interference from the snow. The snow overlays but does not alter the original appearance, maintaining the natural look of the tower.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the clock face and tower preserved without distortion or damage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the clock face and tower's structure maintaining their original geometric shapes. The circular form of the clock and architectural lines remain clear, without any evident distortions caused by editing. No damage to the visual integrity of shapes is apparent.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the clock tower and flags been preserved without any loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the architectural details, like railings, and the flag's textures are visible. These details are clear, with no loss or obvious digital artifacts from the editing process. The painting style is preserved across the design.",
