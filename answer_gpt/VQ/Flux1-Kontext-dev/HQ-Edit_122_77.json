    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the vine-like tendrils follow the natural contour of the head without floating or breaking apart at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vine-like tendrils are visually attached to the hair, wrapping around the head seamlessly. This suggests a natural integration without any floating or disjointed parts, implying a coherent and fluid design element.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the laurel leaves and pastel flowers aligned naturally within the hair structure without overlapping the face or appearing detached from the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The laurel leaves and pastel flowers in Image B appear to be intertwined with the hair, maintaining a cohesive aesthetic and integration with the head without overlaps or detachment that would disrupt the natural appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the emerald green tunic show natural fabric folds and shading that match the posture and lighting of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The emerald green tunic in Image B drapes smoothly over the figure with evident folds, which align with the posture of sitting gracefully and are consistent with the lighting across the garment. This provides a realistic impression of fabric behavior under lighting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the twisted olive trees and marble fragments positioned at a plausible distance from the subject, with correct perspective and no floating or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the twisted olive trees and marble fragments comply with spatial perspective rules, as they are positioned logically around the subject. The elements are grounded, and there are no visual markers indicating floating or misaligned tendencies, supporting a convincing sense of depth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the subjectâ€™s face and clothing align with the ambient light source suggested by the background environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadows in Image B are consistent with the diffuse light emanating from the forested background. The light source seemingly matches the ambient light conditions, as shadowing on the clothing correlates with this scenario, maintaining coherence in the overall visual output.",
