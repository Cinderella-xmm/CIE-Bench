      "question": "Do the proportions of the shirt and tie appear natural and appropriate for the baby's body size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baby is wearing a black suit with a white shirt and a striped tie. The suit and tie seem to be tailored to fit a baby's size as they do not appear oversized or ill-fitting. The tie is proportionate to the width of the small collar, which aligns with typical baby clothing proportions. By observing the visual aspects and considering practical clothing design for infants, the proportions appear natural and appropriate.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt and tie both display a smooth and sheen texture that is consistent with how a typical fabric like silk or polyester might appear under soft lighting.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baby's hands are holding the glasses with their fingers wrapped around the frame naturally.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baby is sitting with arms slightly forward holding glasses, and the suit drapes naturally over the body. The way the material follows the contours of the arms and legs appears realistic, and there are no unusual bulges or stiff areas indicating the clothing is indeed naturally draped on a body.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit, including the shirt and tie, appears cohesive with the babyâ€™s form. There are no visible seams or edges that suggest digital manipulation or misalignment. The clothing appears to sit naturally on the baby, with no signs of editing such as mismatched lighting or awkward junctions.",
