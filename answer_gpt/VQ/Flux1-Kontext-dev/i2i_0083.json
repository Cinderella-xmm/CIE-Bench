      "question": "Does the digital display screen appear to fit seamlessly within the rectangular frame previously occupied by the painting, maintaining the same proportions and alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital display screen preserves the rectangular shape and alignment within the roomâ€™s composition when compared to a traditionally framed painting. The edges of the digital display align consistently with the frame proportions seen in Image A, where a painting previously existed. This denotes a seamless fit, as there is no visible discrepancy in dimensions between the two images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the texture and surface finish of the digital display screen consistent with the surrounding wall, ensuring it does not introduce any unnatural artifacts or discrepancies in material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital display appears smooth and aligns with what is typically expected of a modern screen surface. However, a digital display typically has a glass or plastic surface that may reflect light differently than a painted canvas or a painted wall. The uniformity with the wall texture may not be entirely consistent due to different material properties typical of digital displays.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all the details around the digital display screen, such as the wall edges and the flooring, preserved without any visible distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, the surrounding elements such as wall edges and flooring appear consistent and undistorted in comparison to Image A. The structural integrity of the room, such as lines and shadows that denote depth and alignment, remains intact around the digital display. No visual distortion or loss of detail is evident in these areas.",

      "question": "Does the digital display screen preserve the balance and symmetry of the room, with the armchairs still appearing naturally aligned relative to the new display screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the digital display symmetrically placed between the armchairs, maintaining the balance seen in Image A. The spacing and alignment between the chairs and the display reflect a consistent arrangement, preserving the room's composition and symmetry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and light reflections cast by the digital display screen match those expected from a wall-mounted object, without creating unrealistic or conflicting lighting patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears natural around the digital display, similar to the lighting conditions present in Image A. The shadows and reflections are consistent with what would be expected from a mounted object on the wall, without conflicting or unrealistic lighting patterns that would disrupt visual coherence.",
