    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the energy crown at the top of the Eiffel Tower symmetrically aligned with the tower’s central axis and does it cast consistent light without visible rendering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the energy crown at the top of the Eiffel Tower appears to be positioned symmetrically, aligning with the central axis of the tower, which is crucial for aesthetic balance. The light it emits seems even and without artifacts, suggesting a consistent and well-rendered effect. This conclusion is drawn from observing the visual balance in the image and the uniform quality of the light emission.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the iron lattice girders of the Eiffel Tower preserved in their original geometric configuration, with no signs of bending, stretching, or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lattice girders appear to maintain the recognizable crisscross geometric configuration typical of the Eiffel Tower, indicating that the structural integrity is visually preserved. This observation is based on the knowledge of the Eiffel Tower's structural design featuring straight, interconnected lines.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the luminescent circuits run continuously along the tower’s surface without floating above it, and do they emit light that blends naturally with the surrounding illumination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminescent circuits in Image B are depicted as running along the tower’s surface, seemingly integrated into the overall design. They appear to follow the tower’s contours closely, without floating or being detached, and the light they emit seems to blend naturally with the other light sources in the scene, indicating a cohesive integration.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the digital glyphs embedded into the girders without causing visible displacement or deformation of the metal structure beneath them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital glyphs seem to be overlaid on the tower’s girders and do not cause noticeable displacement or deformation in the structure. The metal framework remains undisturbed, indicating that the glyphs are seamlessly integrated without altering the existing structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the holographic elements appear translucent and layered with depth, and do they avoid intersecting solid parts of the tower or showing pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic elements in Image B are depicted with a sense of translucency and depth, avoiding any intersection with the solid parts of the tower. They maintain a clear visual identity without pixelation, offering the illusion of a layered digital effect separate from the physical structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the pixelated energy barriers positioned directly around the base of the tower and do they have sharp, consistent edges without blurring or floating above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The energy barriers at the base of the tower in Image B are positioned around the structure and are depicted with distinct, sharp edges. They do not appear to float above the ground, maintaining a consistent and clear depiction that suggests solidity and precise positioning.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the digital eyes located in a position consistent with the tower’s architecture and do they emit light that casts soft shadows and reflects off adjacent surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital eyes seem integrated within the tower’s architectural framework, positioned in a way that complements the overall design. The light they emit appears to cast subtle shadows and reflections, adding realism to their digital nature and indicating careful placement and lighting consistency.",
