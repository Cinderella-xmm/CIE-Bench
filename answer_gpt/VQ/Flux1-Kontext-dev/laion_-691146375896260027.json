      "question": "Are the brown LEGO bricks covering the dresser body evenly spaced and aligned, with no visible gaps or irregularities in the surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brown LEGO bricks covering the dresser body appear to be well-aligned and evenly spaced. LEGO bricks are typically designed to interlock without gaps, creating a smooth surface when assembled correctly. There are no visible gaps or irregularities in the surface texture of the dresser body as constructed. Combining this visual information with knowledge about LEGO construction, it is clear that the bricks achieve the intended smooth appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the herringbone marquetry pattern on the front panels clearly defined and continuous, without broken lines or missing segments caused by improper LEGO piece placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front panels of the dresser do not showcase a herringbone marquetry pattern. Instead, the surface is composed of uniform brown LEGO bricks, which do not allow for intricate wood-like patterns. LEGO pieces, due to their size and shape, do not facilitate the replication of detailed patterns typically seen in marquetry. The design is more simplistic, lacking the complexity and continuity of a herringbone pattern, which indicates that the pattern is neither defined nor continuous.",

      "question": "Do the gold decorative borders follow the original curved contours smoothly, without sharp angles or breaks in the flow of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold decorative borders on Image B, constructed from LEGO pieces, attempt to replicate the curved contours. However, given that LEGO pieces are inherently blocky and angular, the borders cannot fluidly follow the curves without some angular adjustments. There are noticeable sharp angles and breaks in the flow due to the nature of LEGO construction, which cannot achieve the smooth, continuous lines of the original design's curves.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the curved side panels and cabriole legs constructed with smoothly joined sloped bricks, showing no visible steps or angular breaks in the profile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the curved side panels and cabriole legs are constructed using LEGO bricks, which inherently have a stepped profile when forming curves or slopes. The visible steps and angular breaks are a natural consequence of using sloped bricks that can't fully mimic organic, smooth curves. This is distinct from materials like wood, which can be carved into seamless shapes, indicating that the LEGO construction does show steps and breaks.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the gray LEGO tile top sit flat and level on the dresser, with clean edges and no visible gaps or misalignments where it meets the sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gray LEGO tile top appears to be positioned flatly and sits level on the dresser. LEGO tiles are designed to fit together without any gaps when properly aligned. There don't seem to be any noticeable gaps or misalignments at the edges where the top meets the sides, indicating that the top is placed correctly and adheres to the flat, level characteristics expected of LEGO constructions.",
