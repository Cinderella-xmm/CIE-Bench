      "question": "Do the biscuit panels on the building walls exhibit uniform texture and color without visible cracks, patches, or unnatural grain patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the biscuit panels on the building walls appear to have a consistent texture and color. The surface of these panels is smooth and appears to be uniformly applied, without any visible inconsistencies such as cracks, patches, or unnatural grain patterns. This is indicative of meticulous editing to create a visually appealing appearance that resembles a well-crafted biscuit facade.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sugar-glazed dome smoothly curved with consistent color and reflective properties, and does it align correctly with the base structure without appearing warped or misproportioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dome in Image B appears smoothly curved and has a consistent color that simulates a sugar-glazed surface. The dome's reflective properties are uniform, contributing to the illusion of a glazed finish, and it aligns well with the base structure. There are no signs of warping or misproportion, implying a careful adjustment to maintain structural integrity in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the icing patterns on the windows and doors clearly defined, evenly applied, and positioned within the frame boundaries without overlapping or deforming the original window/door shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the icing patterns on the windows and doors are well-defined and evenly applied. They are positioned neatly within the frame boundaries, maintaining the original shapes of the windows and doors without any overlap or deformation. This reflects a precise application of the icing effect to emphasize the building's architectural details in a stylized manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the tree trunks and branches maintain natural branching patterns, and are the sugar-coated leaves evenly distributed without clumping or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B possess trunks and branches that exhibit natural branching patterns, contributing to a lifelike representation. The sugar-coated leaves are evenly distributed over these branches, displaying no signs of clumping or floating that might appear artificial. This careful attention to detail results in trees that seamlessly blend into the stylized design of the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the marble slab extend continuously under the building and surrounding area, with consistent lighting and reflection, and no visible gaps or distortions at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the marble slab extends seamlessly under the building and throughout the surrounding area. The lighting and reflective properties of this slab are consistent, which enhances the polished look of the surface. There are no visible gaps or distortions at the edges, indicating a clean, uninterrupted continuation of the slab throughout the scene. This contributes to the cohesive and refined appearance of the edited image.",
