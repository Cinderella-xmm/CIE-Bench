      "question": "Does the long flowing robe have natural fabric draping and folds that follow the contours of the body without unnatural stretching or clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure wearing a long flowing robe appears seated by the lake. The robe shows natural draping and folds that align with the standard appearance of fabric laid loosely around a seated figure. There are no visible signs of unnatural stretching, clumping, or distortion, which indicates that the robe is depicted with a realistic portrayal of how fabric behaves in such a setting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the limbs and joints of the seated figure anatomically correct, with no distorted angles or disproportionate lengths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seated figureâ€™s limbs and joints appear to follow normal anatomical positioning. The legs are bent naturally as a person would sit, and there are no visible signs of disproportionate lengths or distorted angles. This provides a realistic representation of human anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes significantly larger than normal but still proportionally integrated into the face without distorting surrounding facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any figures with abnormally large eyes in the context of human anatomy, as the face is intentionally obscured. Therefore, this question does not apply based on the given image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the mountain and lake reflections exhibit soft, blended watercolor transitions without sharp edges or artificial-looking brush strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lake and mountain reflections show a natural, soft blending of colors with transitions that resemble a watercolor painting. There are no sharp edges or stark contrasts that would suggest an artificial alteration or imposition of brush strokes. This creates a seamless and pleasing visual experience in line with natural reflections.",

      "question": "Is the lilac-edged border uniformly applied around the image without overlapping or obscuring any part of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lilac-edged border surrounds the main image content and does not overlap with or obscure any essential elements of the scene, such as the lake or mountains. The application of the border is consistent and even, maintaining the integrity of the visual presentation.",
