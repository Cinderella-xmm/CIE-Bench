      "question": "Do the tesserae on the chest and torso follow the original armorâ€™s curves without visible breaks, misalignments, or inconsistent tile sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor is depicted with a mosaic pattern that adheres to the curvature of the chest and torso. The tesserae are consistently sized and follow the intricate design of the armor without visible breaks or mismatches, maintaining a coherent flow around the body's contours",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crown and neckpiece in Image B feature mosaic patterns that are well-aligned and symmetrically placed. These elements maintain their intended shapes without distortion, and the visual cohesion ensures there are no missing sections in the design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold and azure colors are consistently applied throughout the armor, wings, and crown. Reflectivity is uniform across these elements, and the transitions between different materials appear smooth without abrupt changes, creating a cohesive visual experience.",
