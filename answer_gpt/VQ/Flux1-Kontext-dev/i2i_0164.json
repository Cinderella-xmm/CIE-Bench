      "question": "Does the area on the train where people were previously sitting look natural without any obvious artifacts or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the region atop the train where the people were located in Image A now looks free of any figures, with no visible artifacts or gaps. The surface where these people sat appears smooth and consistent with the rest of the train's structure, indicating that the editing effectively removed them. This effect is achieved by maintaining the appearance of the train’s texture and color, blending seamlessly with its original details.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the conductor added atop the train well-integrated with the existing lighting and shadows, giving a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The conductor added atop the train in Image B realistically matches the lighting and shadow directions found in the original scene. The shape and posture align well with the lighting from the left side, causing shadows to fall subtly towards the right and downwards. This integration suggests attention to maintaining consistency with the environmental light sources, imparting a natural hue to the conductor's appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the flag held by the conductor look natural, with proper proportions and a logical position relative to the train's motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flag appears proportionate to the conductor's height and position. It is held aloft, catching the wind that would typically be expected due to the train's forward motion. Its size relative to the conductor and its positioning upwards assists in depicting a realistic interaction with the surrounding environment, such as wind direction and force, matching what would be expected in a real-world scenario.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any distortions or misalignments in the train's structure near the area where people were removed, and the conductor was added?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the train's structure near where the original image's people were removed and the conductor added looks seamless. There aren't any noticeable distortions or structural misalignments, suggesting that the editing process maintained the continuity and integrity of the train's physical features such as lines, contours, and surface details, making it appear natural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the image remain balanced and stable after editing, with no noticeable shifts caused by the removal and addition of people?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite changes such as removing people and adding a conductor, the train remains the central focus, preserving the overall composition and scene dynamics. The edits, including the flag addition, do not disrupt the visual balance or cause any off-centered feeling. The scene continues to guide the viewer’s eye along the train’s path and through the gathering crowd, maintaining stability.",
