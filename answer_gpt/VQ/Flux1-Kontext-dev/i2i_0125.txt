    "Question": "Q2: Do the fonts for 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' appear visually consistent with the background image, avoiding any visual disruption or inconsistency?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the font used for 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' is bold and black, placed on a solid light background. This combination offers high contrast but does not create any visual disruption. The lack of texture in the background where the text is placed ensures that the text stands out clearly without clashing with the image. Furthermore, since the background is plain, the font choice becomes the primary focus, and its readability is maintained.",
