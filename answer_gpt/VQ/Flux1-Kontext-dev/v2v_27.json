      "question": "Do the wombat's eyes appear naturally large and expressive without any distortion or unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wombat's eyes are designed to be large and expressive, consistent with a cartoon-like aesthetic. As cartoon characters often have exaggerated features to convey expressions vividly, the eyes appear clear, with no signs of distortion or artifacts. This aligns with common design elements in animated characters which aim for expressive and larger facial features. Hence, the eyes seem natural within the context of an illustrated style.",

      "question": "Does the sitting posture of the wombat in all six poses maintain structural consistency and visual credibility similar to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B independently, the wombat's sitting posture retains consistency across all poses, depicted in a comfortable and laid-back style, typical of illustrations. The way it holds objects or gestures in each pose appears naturally integrated, supporting the character's playful personality. Upon comparison with Image A, which features a similar relaxed sitting position on a chair, both images share continuity in style and design while reflecting a credible sitting posture as cartoon characters are often illustrated. Thus, the structural consistency is preserved.",

      "question": "Are the textures and details of the Hawaiian shirt and straw hat preserved without any unnatural artifacts or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the wombat wearing a Hawaiian shirt and straw hat across all poses. These garments include varied flower and circle patterns typical of Hawaiian shirts and a consistent straw texture on the hat. Despite being simplified for cartoon accuracy, the essence of these items remains coherent without appearing distorted or artificial. Comparing with Image A, both images maintain these items' recognizable features without any apparent loss or unnatural artifacts.",

      "question": "Do the background elements like hibiscus flowers and palm fronds integrate seamlessly into the scene without causing any visual distortion or unnatural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements such as hibiscus flowers and smaller flower illustrations are used, but as decorative accents in a sticker-like arrangement around the wombat. These elements retain cartoon simplicity and fit seamlessly into the image's vibrant color palette without distortion. The lack of complexity in the natural features supports a cohesive and charming look. Image A has a more detailed background with palm fronds, but Image B's approach still achieves visual integration.",

      "question": "Is there adequate clean white space around each sticker, ensuring visual clarity and avoiding any cluttered appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, each sticker of the wombat has clear white space surrounding it which contributes to visual clarity and distinction between each pose. This arrangement enhances the readability and separation of individual elements, which is essential for sticker sheets aimed at ensuring clean presentation. The overall layout prioritizes organization and avoids clutter, aligning with common design principles for sticker sheets.",
