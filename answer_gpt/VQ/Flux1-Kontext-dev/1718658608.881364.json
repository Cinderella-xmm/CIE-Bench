      "question": "Do the ceramic sculptures exhibit a uniform glossy finish with realistic reflections that align with the direction and intensity of the sunset light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture of the octopus has a distinct glossy finish, typical of polished ceramic surfaces, resulting in highlights and reflections. However, the image depicts the octopus in a neutral-lit environment, not influenced by the sunset light direction or intensity because there's no indication of sunset lighting or reflections originating from it.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textured scales evenly distributed across the sculpture surfaces without visible repetition, distortion, or sharp edges suggesting digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus sculpture has scales clearly discernible on its head, distributed evenly and smoothly, indicating no noticeable repetition, distortion, or sharp edges, thus appearance is free of digital artifacting. The surface appears regular and polished.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the deep oceanic blue coloration of the sculptures consistent across all parts and harmonious with the surrounding ocean and sky colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus sculpture has a deep oceanic blue color consistently distributed across its entire surface. There is no depiction of surrounding ocean or sky, ensuring no comparison for harmony within this single scene context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly sandy-colored with no visible traces of the original ocean, waves, or shoreline elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a plain sandy color, with no traces of ocean, waves, or shoreline visible, suggesting it has been edited to a simple, neutral background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sculptures arranged in a continuous, flowing wave pattern that matches the curvature and rhythm of the original ocean waves in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus sculpture is a standalone piece on a uniform background, not arranged with other sculptures to form any pattern, let alone a wave pattern. Thus, no continuous flowing wave pattern akin to an ocean is evident.",
