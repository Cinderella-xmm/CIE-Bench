      "question": "Do the gymnast’s limbs maintain natural joint angles and proportional lengths without exaggerated bends or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast’s limbs appear to maintain natural joint angles and proportional lengths. This conclusion is drawn by observing that the limbs align with typical human anatomy and show no signs of exaggerated bends or missing segments, which would appear unusual or cartoonish.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the seams and fabric folds on the leotard clearly defined and flowing naturally, without jagged edges or unnatural creasing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the seams and fabric folds on the gymnast's leotard appear clear and flow naturally. The edges do not show any jaggedness or unnatural creasing, which indicates that the fabric is realistically rendered with smooth transitions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors used in the gymnast’s outfit and the background include a range of warm, vibrant hues such as red and blue against a neutral background which doesn’t strictly adhere to earthy tones. The colors are consistent and don’t clash; however, they do not fall within earthy tones.",

      "question": "Are the sequin patterns aligned with the existing design on the leotard and uniformly distributed without clustering or overlapping in unnatural ways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sequin patterns on the leotard are coordinated with the existing design. They appear uniformly distributed and do not show any signs of clustering or overlapping, maintaining a consistent flow with the outfit's design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is positioned in a frameset where each panel contains distinct images, including the center panel of the gymnast. This panel is well-positioned to contain the key figures and objects fully without splitting or truncating them.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
