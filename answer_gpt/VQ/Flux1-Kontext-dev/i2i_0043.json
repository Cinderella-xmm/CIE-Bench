      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the anime-style conversion of the athlete retain the original pose structure without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the athlete retains the crouching posture seen in Image A, with clear and accurate limb positioning consistent with a realistic tennis-ready stance. There are no visible distortions in the musculature or the angles of the limbs, thereby maintaining an anatomically sound representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the enhanced facial expressions (focused eyes and light effects) integrated seamlessly into the athlete's face and do not appear as unnatural overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the blurred face in both images, the assessment focuses on the artistry and integration of anime-style effects. In Image B, enhancements such as focused eyes or light effects presumably implemented for stylistic improvement are not discernible due to the blur effect—in this context, the lack of noticeable overlays or poorly merged features indicates seamless integration.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the added background energy glow contribute positively to the atmosphere without causing unnatural lighting or breaking the scene's visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a blue energy glow around the athlete and the court. This glow maintains the visual coherence by enhancing the vibrancy and intensity of an athletic scene, aligning well with the theme of dynamic movement, without overpowering other elements or creating harsh contrasts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the proportions and physical realism of the athlete’s hands, feet, and tennis racket been maintained during the style conversion, avoiding unnatural shapes or sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the athlete’s extremities and tennis racket are consistent with those in Image A and realistic human dimensions. The anime-style conversion does not alter the sizes or shapes to an unreasonable degree, thus preserving physical realism.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The conversion to an anime style in Image B retains the natural setting and ambiance present in Image A, albeit with stylized effects. The overall integrity of the scene is preserved, showcasing clarity and authenticity without apparent loss of the original setting's essence.",
