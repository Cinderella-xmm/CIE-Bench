    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the red helmet and blue cap on the paddles maintain proportional size relative to the paddle heads and avoid stretching or warping the underlying rubber surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red helmet and blue cap are artistically drawn on the paddles, matching their size and shape nicely. This depiction integrates seamlessly with the paddle surfaces without any visible distortion of the original shapes, implying that the artist has preserved their proportionality. There are no signs of stretching or warping of the underlying paddle surfaces, suggesting that the additions have been harmoniously integrated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cartoon facial features and accessories on the paddles seamlessly integrated with no visible stitching, sharp edges, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features and accessories like the helmet and cap on the paddles in Image B are smoothly merged into the illustration without visible stitching or sharp edges. The shading appears consistent with the rest of the image, ensuring each element is part of a coherent and unified design. This suggests that the artist has skillfully integrated these elements for a polished look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the golden edges confined to the perimeter of the box lid and base, without extending into the interior or forming disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden edges in Image B are limited to the boundary areas of the box's lid and base. They provide a neat outline but do not encroach onto the interior of the box. The lines are continuous and do not appear as disconnected fragments, indicating a deliberate and clean design consistent with the stylized artistic approach.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the speech bubbles have pointed tails directed toward the paddles and avoid overlapping with the box or paddle handles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubbles in Image B have pointed tails effectively directed toward the paddles, suggesting a clear intent that the paddles or their associated characters are 'speaking.' These tails and the speech bubbles themselves do not cross over the box or paddle handles, ensuring the layout remains uncluttered and each element retains its clarity.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the treasure map background composed of uniformly drawn lines with no pixelation, aliasing, or irregular stroke widths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background resembles a treasure map illustrated with smooth, consistent lines. The strokes show no pixelation or aliasing, lending a high-quality, vintage comic feel. The stroke widths are uniform, providing seamless integration into the adventurous theme and maintaining aesthetic coherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the paddles tilted upward from the box but still supported by the handle slots, maintaining structural plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paddles appear tilted upward from the box, yet their handles rest in the slots, suggesting a plausible arrangement. This positioning implies thoughtfulness regarding physical dynamics, considering it emulates a natural display posture while the handles remain anchored. The image showcases this angle without violating structural believability.",
