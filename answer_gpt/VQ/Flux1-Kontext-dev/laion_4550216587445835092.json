    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and grin added to the energy blast positioned within the glowing orb and aligned with its curvature, without creating jagged edges or broken light paths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an energy blast with added facial features like eyes and a grin. These elements are neatly integrated within the orb. The curvature aligns well with the glowing orb's natural shape, avoiding any jagged edges or inconsistencies in the light paths surrounding it. This creates a seamless integration of the facial features without disturbing the existing flow of the orb's energy dynamics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dialogue bubble positioned so that it does not overlap with Naruto’s face or hand, and does it have clean borders and readable text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dialogue bubble is clearly positioned away from Naruto’s face and hand. It sits comfortably beside the energy blast on the left side of the composition. The borders of the dialogue bubble are clean, and the text within is readable and formatted to avoid intruding on significant image elements, thereby maintaining visual coherence and focus.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the motion lines and energy beams from the spirit and Naruto’s attack converge smoothly at the fusion point, showing continuous flow without abrupt breaks or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the motion lines and energy beams that originate from both the spirit and Naruto's attack converge at the fusion point. These aspects illustrate a fluid motion and demonstrate continuous flow without any discernible abrupt breaks or misalignment. The joining of these two energy sources appears dynamic and cohesive.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the debris and elemental fragments in the background rendered with consistent lighting and shadow, appearing to float in a shared 3D space rather than being pasted flatly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The debris and elemental fragments in Image B are rendered with consistent lighting and shadow effects, achieving a three-dimensional representation. They appear to be floating in a shared space with depth, instead of being superimposed flatly onto the scene. This suggests careful attention to lighting and perspective, enhancing the overall dynamic and spatial feeling of the environment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does Naruto’s face retain the original number of whisker marks, eye shape, and headband position, with no distorted lines or missing features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Naruto's face retains the characteristic features seen in Image A: the whisker marks are consistent in number, the eye shape remains unchanged, and the headband is positioned correctly on his forehead. There are no distortions or omissions of these key facial attributes. This demonstrates a faithful reproduction of the character's original design elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the action bubble placed in a visible area of the image without covering Naruto’s hand or the fusion point, and does it use consistent styling with the dialogue bubble?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The action bubble in Image B is strategically positioned to avoid covering Naruto's hand or the crucial fusion point. It maintains clear visibility and adheres to the design style of the dialogue bubble previously assessed, both using similar border styles and text format. This cohesive styling ensures the bubble integrates well with the overall layout without obstructing key visual elements.",
