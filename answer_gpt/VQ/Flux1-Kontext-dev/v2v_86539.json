      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the exercising figure appears well-integrated with distinct features like the pose and clothing consistent with a cartoon style.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The use of bold outlines and flat colors is common in comic art to draw attention and create a distinctive style.

This layout aligns with comic drawings which often separate actions into distinct frames for clarity.",
