      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks forming the hot dog uniformly shaped, properly aligned, and free of distorted or misshapen pieces that compromise structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog appears to be constructed using LEGO bricks. These bricks typically have a standard size and shape, which ensures uniformity and proper alignment when connected. From the visual cues in the image, the LEGO hot dog does not show distorted or misshapen pieces that would disrupt its structural consistency. The bricks fit together neatly, maintaining a consistent form, which is characteristic of properly assembled LEGO structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the ceramic mosaic bottle feature smooth, non-glass-like surfaces with clearly defined geometric patterns in red, yellow, and tan, without unnatural reflections or transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the bottle exhibits a mosaic-like appearance with patterns in red, yellow, and tan. The patterns are geometric, giving the impression of being composed of tile-like, non-glass elements. The surface doesn't exhibit reflections typical of glass or transparency, suggesting that it's made of ceramic with a matte finish. This conclusion was drawn from the visual observation of color patterns and surface texture.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the LEGO hot dog's length proportionally consistent with the original hot dog’s size relative to the cutting board and nearby objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing Image B to Image A, the LEGO hot dog appears to be placed in a similar location on the cutting board as the original hot dog. The proportions relative to the cutting board and surrounding objects seem consistent between both images. The LEGO version replicates the general dimensions and positional context of the original object, maintaining proportional consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the ceramic bottle have a rounded, flowing shape with no sharp angles or blocky geometry that would disrupt visual harmony with the LEGO hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bottle that has a more angular, blocky geometry due to the mosaic pattern that resembles tiles. This contrasts with the usual rounded shape of a typical bottle but complements the LEGO hot dog’s blocky appearance. However, the question asks for a lack of blocky geometry, which the mosaic bottle does not fulfill as it has pronounced straight edges, integrating a distinct visual style different from the rounded flowing shape of a standard bottle.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden base under both the LEGO hot dog and ceramic bottle seamless, with consistent wood grain and color matching the surrounding table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base, observed in Image B, appears seamless without any visible discontinuities between the closer view of the wood grain and the broader table surface. The color and texture of the wooden base reflect consistency in terms of hue and material finish relative to the surrounding table, providing a uniform appearance that integrates well with the overall setting of the image.",
