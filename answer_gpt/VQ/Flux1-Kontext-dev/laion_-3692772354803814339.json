      "question": "Are the swirling ocean wave patterns inside the crystal bottle smooth, continuous, and free of jagged edges or unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a swirling pattern representing ocean waves is depicted inside a crystal bottle. The visual cues suggest that these wave patterns are designed to appear smooth and flowing, akin to natural ocean waves. Considering the absence of pixelation or abrupt discontinuities, the wave patterns inside the bottle appear smoothly rendered, adhering to the natural aesthetic of ocean waves. Thus, they appear smooth, continuous, and without jagged edges.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the golden maritime symbols on the bottle label occupy the correct area, maintain sharp edges, and show no signs of pixelation or smudging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden maritime symbols on the bottle label in Image B are crisp and clear, maintaining the integrity of their defined edges. As they appear sharp and without any visible pixelation or blurring, they are visually accurate and occupy the intended area properly. Such precision suggests a high-quality, well-rendered design.",

      "question": "Does the compass rose at the top of the packaging have evenly spaced metallic points with realistic reflections and no misalignment or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The compass rose in Image B is designed with metallic points that exhibit realistic reflections, adding a sense of depth and dimension. Each point on the compass rose appears evenly spaced, and there are no visible signs of misalignment, clipping, or artifacts that would suggest poor rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition from the bottle neck to the wave-patterned body seamless, with no abrupt breaks or geometric deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition from the neck of the bottle to the body where the wave patterns are depicted appears smooth and seamless. There are no visual indications of sudden breaks, changes in geometry, or distortions where the bottle neck merges with the wave-patterned body. This continuity in design indicates a well-executed aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the parchment surface of the packaging display consistent aging texture without artificial streaks or uneven shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parchment surface in Image B shows a consistent texture that resembles aged parchment paper. The shading appears even, and there are no artificial streaks or signs of uneven texture affecting its appearance. The design accurately simulates a natural aging process, contributing to the overall authenticity of the look.",
