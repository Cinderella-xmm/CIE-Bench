    "Question": "Q1: Does the cat maintain natural proportions and anatomical structure without visible stretching, compression, or deformation in the shadow box scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat lying on the settee appears to have exaggerated proportions, perhaps due to an intentional artistic choice. Its body is unusually rotund, and while cats can be fluffy or large, this depiction seems more exaggerated than realistic. This might not align with natural anatomical proportions seen in typical cats.",
    "answer": "No"
