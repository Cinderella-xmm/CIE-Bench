    "Question": "Q1: Does the silhouette of the rider maintain correct limb proportions and joint alignment without unnatural elongation or compression?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the rider features a stylized design typical of illustrations which often exaggerate or simplify proportions for artistic effect. The limbs and joints appear consistent with such stylizations, maintaining relative proportionate balance without appearing disjointed. Hence, within this artistic context, the proportions and alignment are appropriate.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the sand streaks in the background smoothly blended with the motion blur and do they follow the direction of travel without sharp, unnatural breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, rather than realistic sand streaks, the image features abstract background lines suggestive of movement and speed. These lines flow outward from the center, reinforcing the motion direction of the rider and ensuring no disruptions although stylized. The abstract interpretation avoids sharp interruptions in motion representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the 'RaceFuel' text clearly legible and positioned without obscuring key parts of the rider or motorcycle, and does it blend cohesively with the overall design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'RaceFuel' is legibly styled and prominently positioned relative to the motorcycle and rider, ensuring no obstruction of key design elements. Its location aids in highlighting the theme without interfering visually, achieving cohesion within the energetic and illustrative design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the track outline in the upper-right corner form a continuous, closed loop without self-intersections or broken segments?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts an illustrative design with symbolic elements rather than realistic specifics seen in a racing track map. The upper part does not emphasize a track outline nor demonstrate such features, focusing on artistic interpretation rather than realism; hence, the question mismatches the visible contents.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the speedometer icon positioned correctly at the bottom of the image with a clear, non-deformed dial and needle pointing to maximum speed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the speedometer icon is correctly placed at the bottom of the image embodying artistic stylization. Despite exaggerated and expressive design features, the needle is clearly oriented towards maximum speed, appropriately adding thematic intensity without shape distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
