      "question": "Does the area around the apples show any unnatural textures or artifacts after adding the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' are positioned on the top and bottom surrounding areas of the apples. The background in these areas is solid and uniform, unlike the textured wooden table in Image A or a textured background. There is no noticeable disruption or artifacts in Image B around these texts, which appear clean and seamlessly integrated with the solid background.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the fonts for \"Fresh\" and \"Sweet\" appear visually consistent with the background image, avoiding any visual disruption or inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the font used for 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' is bold and black, placed on a solid light background. This combination offers high contrast but does not create any visual disruption. The lack of texture in the background where the text is placed ensures that the text stands out clearly without clashing with the image. Furthermore, since the background is plain, the font choice becomes the primary focus, and its readability is maintained.",

      "question": "Are the shapes of the apples preserved without distortion after incorporating the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The apples in Image B remain undistorted despite the addition of the text at the top and bottom. They have retained their original shape and outline, indicating that the text placement did not interfere with or alter the form of the apples.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the alignment of the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right properly aligned so that it doesn't alter the apples' structure or visual balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texts 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' are positioned above and below the apples without intruding into their space or altering their structure. This alignment maintains the visual balance, keeping the focus on the apples while the text serves as complementary information.",

      "question": "Have the fine details of the apples, including their speckles and light reflections, remained clear and undamaged after adding the text “Fresh” and “Sweet”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The apples in Image B exhibit clear details, with speckles and light reflections intact and undistorted. The text addition did not impact these elements, which continue to portray the apples as fresh and crisp. The quality of the apples' surface texture is preserved in the edited image.",
