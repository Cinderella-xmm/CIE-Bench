    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the arms and legs of the figure have clearly defined joints and correct proportions, with no missing or extra limbs, and do the hands each have exactly five fingers arranged naturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms and legs of the figure are not visible clearly due to the angle and clothing style, but the evident visual cues suggest correct proportions. The hands appear to have exactly five fingers, arranged naturally. Based on the standard depiction of dolls, additional limbs or missing parts would be obviously noticeable, but no such anomalies are present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the pattern on the jacket and the stitching on the skirt preserved and aligned correctly, with no distorted or repeated textures, and does the fabric drape naturally over the doll's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a jacket with a visible pattern and stitching on the skirt that appears correctly aligned and naturally integrated into the attire. The texture and alignment are consistent, indicating well-preserved design elements. The fabric of the skirt and jacket also seems to drape naturally over the doll's form, showing no signs of distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lace trim around the collar thin and evenly applied, with no visible gaps, misalignment, or unnatural shadows indicating poor integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lace trim around the collar in Image B is thin, evenly applied, and shows no visible gaps or misalignment. The integration seems natural with the construction of the doll's attire, and there are no visible shadows that would suggest poor integration. Lace is typically detailed in such costumes, and Image B does reflect this accurately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the velvet hat properly sized relative to the head, with visible fabric texture and soft shadows that suggest it is resting on the head rather than floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat appears to be properly sized relative to the head, with visible fabric texture that possesses the characteristic softness of velvet. The shadows around the hat suggest it is resting on the head naturally, with no indication that it is floating or disproportionate.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cobblestone ground, gas lamps, and horse-drawn carriages in the background proportionally smaller than the doll and rendered with consistent textures and lighting that match the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cobblestone ground, gas lamps, and horse-drawn carriages are proportionally smaller than the doll, as would be consistent in perspective for a doll-centric scene. The textures and lighting in these background elements are consistent and match the overall serene setting, reinforcing the scale difference and aesthetic coherence of the scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the face have simplified features typical of a doll (such as painted eyes and smooth skin), and do the limbs show clear joint lines or hinges without unnatural bending or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the face is blurred, the general impression given by the rest of the body matches typical characteristics of a doll with simplified features. The visible limbs do not show any unnatural bending or stretching, nor evident joint lines or hinges, typical of well-crafted dolls.",
