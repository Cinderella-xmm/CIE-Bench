    "Question": "Q1: Does the character’s head appear significantly larger than the body while maintaining smooth contours and proper alignment of limbs and torso without visible stretching or tearing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character depicted showcases a comically larger head compared to its body, which is a common stylistic choice in animated illustrations, often known as 'caricature.' The proportions are intentionally exaggerated, yet the rest of the body retains proper alignment with a smooth connection between all components, maintaining a consistent cartoon style, thus the contours are smooth and no stretching or tearing is visible.",
