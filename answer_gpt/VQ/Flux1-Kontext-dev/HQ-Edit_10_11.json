      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the entire body of the gorilla exhibit consistent wood texture and shading, with no sudden color changes or patches that appear non-wood-like?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla's body is depicted with a consistent wood texture throughout. The wooden texture is uniform, and the shading follows the natural contours of the gorilla's anatomy, showcasing an even distribution without any noticeable abrupt changes in color or texture that deviate from the wood-like appearance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the engraved fur patterns on the gorilla's body varied in depth and direction, resembling natural wood grain rather than repetitive or synthetic lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wood engraving on the gorilla's body is artistically executed, giving an impression of natural fur patterns. The engravings vary in depth and follow different directions, closely mimicking the randomness and natural flow observed in real wood grain, as opposed to repetitive or overly synthetic lines that would not suit a natural appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arms and legs retain anatomically correct proportions and joint structures, with no flattened or unnaturally curved sections due to excessive smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla's limbs are depicted with careful attention to anatomical accuracy. The arms and legs maintain realistic proportions, and the joints are well-defined. There are no signs of excessive smoothing that would cause the limbs to appear flattened or unnaturally curved, ensuring a faithful representation of a gorilla's anatomy.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of etched wood patterns with darker leaf shapes integrated into it, maintaining depth and layering without appearing flat or disjointed from the gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features wood patterns that have been etched to create depth and layering. The leaf shapes are darker and seem to be integrated naturally into this wooden backdrop, providing a three-dimensional appearance that complements the depth of the gorilla itself, and ensuring the elements are cohesive rather than appearing flat or disjointed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scattered leaves in the background rendered in darker wood tones and placed in positions that suggest natural resting or embedding into the wooden surface, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves depicted in the background are rendered in darker wood tones, which contrasts them against the rest of the wooden texture. Their positioning suggests they naturally rest or are embedded within the wooden surface. They do not appear to float awkwardly or overlap in a manner that would suggest they are incorrectly placed, maintaining a realistic and coherent composition.",
