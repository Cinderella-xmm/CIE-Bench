    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the wood grain on the pug's body appear continuous and natural, with no repeating patterns or unnatural stretching, especially along the spine and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image represents a pug crafted to appear as if it were carved from wood. The body's surface shows a smooth wooden texture that extends over its form consistently. The wood grain, crucial for imitating natural wood, does not show signs of repeating patterns or unnatural distortions like stretching along the spine and limbs. This reflects careful craftsmanship to maintain a realistic look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and creases on the pug’s face rendered as smooth, shallow grooves consistent with carved wood, without sharp, broken, or overly deep lines that disrupt the natural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pug’s face in Image B displays features designed to resemble wood carving. The wrinkles and creases are shaped as gentle indentations consistent with wood, presenting as smooth and shallow grooves. These do not appear as sharp or excessively deep, which helps maintain the intended natural carved appearance without disrupting the form of the structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the pug’s limbs, head, and torso retain their original proportions and anatomical alignment, with no visible elongation, compression, or misshapen joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anatomical features of the pug—the limbs, head, and torso—are proportioned appropriately, consistent with realistic pug anatomy transformed into wooden sculpture. There aren’t visible signs of disproportion such as elongation, compression, or misalignment of joints that would render its form anatomically incorrect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the transitions between different parts of the wooden pug (e.g., head to neck, ear to head) seamless, with no visible cracks, ghosting, or color discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transitions from one part of the pug's body to another in Image B are crafted to ensure continuity, characteristic of a single unified piece of carved wood. There are no indications of cracks or ghosting where different sections meet, and the coloration remains consistent across the transitions, reinforcing seamless unity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the black base beneath the pug flat, uniformly dark, and fully supporting the pug’s feet without any gaps, shadows suggesting suspension, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black base in Image B beneath the pug is designed flat with a consistent dark shade. It is positioned such that the pug appears resting naturally upon it, with all feet making contact. There is no evidence of any gaps or shadows that might imply suspension or misalignment between the pug's feet and the base, ensuring proper support.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the highlights and shadows on the wooden pug match the ambient lighting of the scene, with reflections and depth appropriate for polished wood rather than fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a pug in a polished wooden form, where highlights and shadows are formed consistent with ambient lighting reflecting from its surface. The rendering invokes a realistic interaction with light, appropriate for polished wood, rather than resembling fur. This results in depth and reflection fitting for a carved wooden entity.",
