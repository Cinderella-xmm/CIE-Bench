      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed building retain consistent geometric proportions and smooth surface transitions, with no visible warping or broken edges in its armored body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, I observed the robot's structure, which replaces the building's architecture. The robot appears to have a smooth surface with consistent geometric proportions typical of advanced armor designs. There are no visible flaws like warping or broken edges, which suggests a well-integrated transformation that harmonizes with the original image's architectural style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stylized shoulder pads seamlessly integrated into the roofline, with clean, sharp edges and coherent patterns that do not appear stretched or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's shoulder pads resemble decorative elements often seen in futuristic designs. They are integrated into the overall design of the robot, showcasing clean, sharp edges and coherent patterns that maintain the integrity of the original proportions and do not appear stretched or distorted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the replaced traffic signs display clear holographic effects (e.g., soft glow, transparency) without causing light leaks or unnatural color shifts in adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "I examined the visual cues of the traffic signs in Image B, where holographic effects are present. The signs exhibit a soft glow and transparency, suggesting advanced light technology. There are no visible signs of light leaks or unnatural color shifts in the surrounding areas, indicating a careful and consistent integration of holographic effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the robotic pedestrians have correctly proportioned limbs with five fingers per hand, and do their joints and body shapes follow geometric logic without unnatural bending or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the robotic pedestrians in Image B, their limbs are proportionate and display five fingers per hand, conforming to typical humanoid design. The joints and body shapes follow geometric logic, with no unnatural bending or missing segments, suggesting a consistent and realistic transformation from human figures in the original image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are shadows cast by the robotic pedestrians and the transformed building consistent with the direction of sunlight from the top-left, and do they align naturally with surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows shadows cast by the robot and pedestrians, aligning with the apparent direction of sunlight. The shadows seem to fall naturally and consistently with the lighting direction from the top-left. This is similar to the original image's lighting scheme, indicating that the alterations preserve realistic shadow consistency with surrounding objects.",
