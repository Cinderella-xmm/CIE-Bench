      "question": "Do the enlarged and shiny mango pieces retain their natural texture and shape without appearing distorted or unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango pieces have an enlarged and shiny appearance that gives them a more stylized, almost plastic look. Their edges are very sharp and neatly cubed, which can appear unnatural when compared to the natural irregularity seen in real mango flesh. The texture lacks the slight fibrous and varied surface one would expect from a real mango, leading to a more artificial look. This suggests that while the pieces are tidy in shape, they do not retain the natural texture and soft appearance typical of real mango pieces.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the cartoon-like design of the lime and chili powder bowl appear visually credible and free from unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime is depicted with a very uniform and glossy surface, lacking the slight texture and color variation found in real limes. Likewise, the chili powder bowl appears highly polished and consistent in color, resembling a computer-generated effect rather than the rough granularity of actual chili powder. This can create a cartoon-like feel, which, while intentional, does not produce a visually credible, lifelike appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the overall composition and layout of the edited elements, including the whimsical mango figurine, lime, and chili powder bowl, visually credible and structurally consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of Image B includes elements arranged in a well-structured and aesthetically pleasing manner, but the overall effect is more polished and stylized than naturally credible. The mango pieces, lime, and chili powder are positioned consistently on the plate; however, each element has an idealized design that suggests a departure from natural realism. Thus, while it is structurally consistent, the visual credibility compared to natural presentations is reduced due to the evident editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the shiny 3D effect on the mango pieces enhance the visual appeal without degrading fine details or introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shiny 3D effect on the mango pieces in Image B gives them an enhanced aesthetic appeal, similar to a digital rendering, but at the expense of finer details that characterize a natural mango. The textures appear overly smooth and plastic-like, without the subtle fibrous patterns typical of real mango flesh. This stylistic choice results in a loss of natural texture but may appeal to those appreciating a more graphic or stylized appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the whimsical mango figurine retain its structural integrity and natural appearance, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango figurine maintains its geometric shape without any noticeable distortions or broken forms. The cubed pieces are sharply defined and consistent in size and shape, presenting a coherent structure. However, the appearance is stylized rather than natural, due to the high gloss and uniformity in the depiction. Despite this, the structural integrity is retained, with no evident shape distortions.",
