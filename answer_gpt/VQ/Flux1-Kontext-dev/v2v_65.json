        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in the snow globe is rendered in a style that preserves the proportions and physical attributes typically found in chibi representations, including exaggerated head size and simplified features while maintaining correct anatomy. The appearances of the character's armor and clothing, though made chibi, are consistent with a logical 3D form, implying structural consistency without noticeable distortions.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts a realistic interaction between light and the snow globe, with reflections and sparkles that enhance the visual softening effect typical of daylight filtering through a window. The clarity and smoothness of these reflections suggest naturalness without visible artifacts.",
