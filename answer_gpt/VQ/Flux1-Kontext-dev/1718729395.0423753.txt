    "Question": "Q2: Are the added ornate garments visually integrated with the figure’s body, showing realistic draping, fold depth, and material consistency without floating or disconnected elements?",
    "explanation": "The ornate garments in Image B align well with the typical visual traits of period garments, where we see appropriate draping, reasonable fold depth, and consistent material texture. This suggests careful integration of the garments with the figure's body, without any visual disruptions or disconnections.",

They are applied in a way that respects the feather structure, without causing sharp glares or breaking the feather edges, making them look integrated into the natural design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
