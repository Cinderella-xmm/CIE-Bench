    "Question": "Q1: Are the muscle proportions of the player in red (player #24) exaggerated but still anatomically plausible without visible distortion or unnatural bulging?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the player in red, #24, appears to have enhanced muscle definition, which can be a stylistic choice typical in sports-themed imagery to emphasize athleticism. Despite the enhancement, the muscles do not show signs of distortion or unnatural bulging that would be inconsistent with athletic builds. The proportions follow a plausible anatomical structure frequent in athletes, maintaining realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the uniform colors of both players retain natural color gradients and material textures despite increased vibrancy, without appearing oversaturated or flat?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the uniforms appear more vibrant, which enhances the visual impact. However, the natural gradients and material textures, such as the fabric weave and sheen, are retained well enough to avoid an oversaturated or flat appearance. The increased vibrancy does not detract from the natural representation of the materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the team logos on both players' helmets and jerseys accurately rendered and properly aligned without deformation or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the logos on the helmets and jerseys are clearly visible. They appear to be accurately rendered with no visible deformation or pixelation, maintaining alignment with the players' movements and positions. This ensures that branding is still recognizable and proportionate.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the background behind the players stylistically enhanced but still coherent with the foreground, without sudden distortions or loss of detail in the crowd or field markings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background details such as the crowd and field markings remain coherent with the foreground. Although there is stylistic enhancement that may increase brightness and color contrast, it does not introduce any sudden distortions or excessive loss of detail. The enhanced visual effect supports the action and context of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the limbs and body postures of both players maintain structural consistency with real-world biomechanics, even with exaggerated motion, without broken joints or floating limbs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the players' limbs and body postures are depicted in a way that aligns with the biomechanics of real-world athletic movement. Despite possibly exaggerated motion for dramatic effect, the structure does not show any anomalies like broken joints or disjointed limbs. The motion expressions are consistent with dynamic sports plays.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the matte black collector's box with transparent lid visually consistent in material, lighting, and perspective, and does it surround the cards without introducing edge artifacts or lighting mismatches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the matte black collector's box is designed to include a transparent lid. The materials used, along with lighting and perspective, are consistent and realistic. The box encases the card effectively without introducing noticeable edge artifacts or mismatches in lighting, ensuring the presentation is cohesive.",
    "answer": "Yes"
