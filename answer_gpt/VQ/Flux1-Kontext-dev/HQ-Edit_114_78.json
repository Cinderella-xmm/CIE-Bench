      "question": "Does the key maintain its original geometric shape and proportions when transformed into a bridge, without any visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the key is visually represented as part of a small diorama, and it overlaps a model bridge in the scene. Examining the key's intricate design and metallic texture, it appears consistent with the original while fitting naturally into the motif without visible distortion. This is because keys of such filigree design typically exhibit three-dimensional symmetry that allows them to retain structure even in varying compositions. By comparing it visually with Image A, the key's distinctive decorative and structural elements remain unchanged, suggesting no warping or proportion distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tiny houses and trees positioned in a way that aligns with the wood grain’s depth and surface plane, without floating or appearing disconnected from the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature houses and trees are positioned in the scenic diorama. They appear to integrate well on the visible plane, with shadows and light angles consistent with the overall scene and the wood grain’s texture. This combination of depth and surface alignment suggests deliberate positioning. Upon comparing to Image A, where the wood grain solely serves as a backdrop, both grains similarly imply a coherent surface upon which objects can naturally rest, supporting the conclusion of alignment and connectivity.",

      "question": "Does the resin river emerge smoothly from the key’s bit and flow with consistent material properties, showing no sharp breaks or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The river in Image B is a part of the diorama. Its base flows naturally from the key's bit, maintaining consistent coloration and texture, resembling typical diorama depiction. The gentle curves and uniform translucency are indicative of a well-rendered resin piece. Comparing the smooth flowing nature of the river in Image B with the key from Image A, the integration within the scene implies coherence in material continuity without abrupt transitions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the boundary of the key case clearly defined and consistent with the wood grain and metallic tones of the key, without abrupt changes in texture or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boundary of the key case is visually marked by a wooden frame containing the diorama scene. It appears consistent and seamlessly integrates with the grain and metallic elements of the key, showing the wood and metal working in harmony with color and texture. Comparing this to Image A, we see the continuity of wood grain and the precision in metallic textures, confirming coherence without abrupt changes.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the carved wooden hill seamlessly blended into the surrounding wood grain, with consistent texture and shading that suggests natural carving rather than digital patching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carved wooden hill in Image B is part of a miniaturized diorama scene. Its texture and shading appear consistent with natural wood carving, blending smoothly with the background wood grain. Commonly in carved pieces, subtle gradients and consistent textural elements are indicators of natural artistry rather than synthetic overlays. By comparing to the wood grain focus of Image A, we confirm continuity in texture and shading appropriateness, reinforcing natural blending.",
