      "question": "Does the black fur and formal tie retain their natural texture and color, appearing authentic within the context of a collectible figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black fur is rendered with a smooth, polished texture common in designer or collectible figures, which often emphasizes a sleek and stylish appearance rather than a naturalistic one.

These elements are coherent with the aesthetic of a collectible figure that is styled in a way that aligns with trendy desk toys.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat has been designed in a seated position with a forward-facing stance, which is a common and logically structured pose for a collectible figure.
