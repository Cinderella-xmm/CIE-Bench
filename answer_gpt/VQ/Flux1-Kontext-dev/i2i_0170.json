      "question": "Are the clothing and bags of both women depicted with soft gradient blocks that retain their original shapes and proportions without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing and bags of both women are illustrated with stylized colors and clear lines, characteristic of a digital illustration style. This approach focuses on maintaining the shape and proportions of the clothing and bags while simplifying the texture details. There is no introduction of unnatural artifacts, and the simplified style preserves the essential features, such as the distinct outlines and proportions of the clothing and accessories.",

      "question": "Do the mannequins and their outfits inside the store window appear structurally coherent and visually plausible in terms of shape and material after the style conversion, without any noticeable distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mannequins and their outfits inside the store window are represented in a stylized manner with clear outlines and flat colors typical of a digital illustration format. This style maintains the structural coherence and basic shape of the mannequins and outfits without distortions or unnatural textures, emphasizing simplicity and abstraction over realistic materials.",

      "question": "Does the storefront maintain its original architectural details, such as the frame and tiles, without any visible distortion or introduction of non-natural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the storefront is stylized with a cartoon-like depiction which simplifies the architectural details into bold, flat shapes and colors. The frame of the window and surrounding elements are clear and without distortion, maintaining their basic shapes and ensuring coherence with the illustration style. Thus, there is no visible distortion or introduction of unnatural textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the texture of the cobblestone pavement represented naturally with soft gradients, maintaining the structural integrity and visual coherence without any loss of detail or unnatural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cobblestone pavement is depicted with simplified shapes and uniform color patches typical of a stylized illustration. While the detailed texture is simplified, the pavement's depiction is coherent within the context of the illustration style. However, it doesn't feature soft gradients - instead, it uses flat colors typical of the style, maintaining structural integrity without any unnatural appearance.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the lighting effects and shadows in the image convincingly portrayed with soft gradient blocks, ensuring they contribute to the overall realism and natural appearance without breaking the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting effects and shadows are expressed through flat colors and clear lines instead of soft gradient blocks. This approach fits the overall illustrative style but does not employ gradients typical in realistic depictions. The style achieves visual flow without breaking the overall coherence, yet doesn't utilize soft gradients.",
