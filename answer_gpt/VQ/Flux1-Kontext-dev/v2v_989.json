      "question": "Does the chibi-style illustration of the dog retain its distinct characteristics without unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is illustrated in a chibi-style with simplified features typical of such illustrations. The cartoon-like representation maintains the recognizable characteristics of the dog, like its shape and posture. Despite being a simplistic and exaggerated art form, it does not show any unnatural textures or significant loss of fine details, considering the chibi art style is inherently minimalistic.",

      "question": "Does the bold white outline around the illustration enhance visual clarity without disrupting structural coherence or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a bold white outline around the elements of the illustration, which serves to enhance visual clarity by distinguishing the various components and preventing them from blending into the background. This outline does not disrupt the structural coherence as it maintains the recognizable forms of the objects and the dog. There are no apparent artifacts introduced by the outline, and it instead provides a clean distinction as desired in sticker or illustration art.",

      "question": "Do the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag maintain structural consistency and visual credibility in their minimalist flat design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag are depicted in a minimalist flat design. This stylization preserves the basic structure and recognizable features of each object, similar to how they appear in stylized illustrations. Minimalistic representation does not detract from credibility; rather, it suits the intended artistic style. Thus, structural consistency and visual credibility are maintained as they are recognizable and proportionally accurate in this design language.",

      "question": "Does the extension of the dog and bench slightly beyond the circular frame preserve natural appearance and avoid distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and part of the bench extend slightly beyond the circular frame, a typical design choice for stickers to create an engaging effect. This extension is done in a manner that does not distort the natural appearance of the objects. Instead, it adds a sense of depth and dynamism to the design. The proportions remain unchanged, and their extended position does not compromise the natural look of the illustration.",

      "question": "Does the transparent background maintain the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sticker in Image B is set against a transparent background, which allows for versatility in application on various surfaces without altering the perception of its elements. This transparency helps maintain authenticity as it showcases the illustration without added backgrounds that could disrupt appearance. The stickerâ€™s design is optimized for this transparent format, not affecting the natural look of the overall sticker.",
