      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the puzzle sections on the horseâ€™s body clearly defined with clean, interlocking edges that follow the natural curves of the horse's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse displays a surface with floral patterns, but there are no visible interlocking edges or sections that suggest it is made up of puzzle pieces. The design appears contiguous and seamless, without typical puzzle characteristics such as defined edges or differentiation between sections. Therefore, although the horse is decorated, it does not exhibit characteristics typical of a puzzle format.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the floral patterns on each puzzle section align seamlessly at the edges where pieces meet, maintaining visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a horse covered with floral patterns. These patterns appear to be painted or applied directly and continuously across the surface without visible separations or misalignments that would be present if they were part of a puzzle with separate pieces. Therefore, there's no evidence of puzzle sections, and the concept of aligning patterns doesn't apply.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass dome over the horse clear and free from unnatural distortions, smudges, or irregular reflections that would suggest poor material simulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome encapsulating the horse appears very clear, with only minor reflections that are typical of glass material when displayed in any kind of lighting. There are no visible smudges, distortions, or irregularities that detract from clarity, suggesting the glass is simulated well.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wooden base exhibit realistic wood grain and texture, and is the compass embedded in a way that matches the surface plane and scale of the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B is crafted to show a detailed wood grain and texture consistent with real wood. The compass is embedded into the base, aligning well with the surface plane, appearing naturally integrated both in position and scale, making it realistic in its depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the antique-brass accents positioned logically on the frame and base, with a matte-to-slight-reflective finish consistent with aged metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic accents on the base appear to be in burnished or antique brass. They are placed in positions where hardware might naturally occur on such a glass display case. The finish on these accents is neither overly shiny nor unrealistically bright, suggesting an aged look consistent with antique metals, demonstrating the appropriate material simulation.",
