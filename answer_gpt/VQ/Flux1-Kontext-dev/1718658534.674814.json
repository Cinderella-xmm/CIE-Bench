      "question": "Does the surface of the figurine exhibit a uniform glossy finish consistent with ceramic material, without patches of retained knit texture or uneven sheen?",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

This glossy surface reflects light consistently, indicating a smooth and even sheen without any knit texture remnants that were present in Image A. This suggests that the texture has been altered to remove any knit-like features and give a ceramic-like appearance.",
