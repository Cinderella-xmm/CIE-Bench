      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the shoulder and chest armor sections display realistic metallic sheen with proper light reflection and depth, avoiding flat or overly shiny surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor sections on the shoulders and chest appear to have a realistic metallic sheen, which indicates a quality rendering of metallic surfaces. This is achieved through highlights and reflections that mimic real metal. Surrounding ambient light is well-reflected on the armor, providing depth while avoiding an overly shiny, unrealistic appearance. This gives the metallic parts a believable texture and volume.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the joint areas of the armor aligned with the underlying anatomy and free from geometric distortions or unnatural gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The joints of the armor in Image B seem to align well with the areas where natural joints would be, such as the shoulders and elbows, which allows for movement without unnatural gaps or distortions in the geometry. This coherence indicates a thoughtful design process that accounts for human anatomy, enhancing the credibility of the futuristic armor's design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the metallic hair strands appear as continuous, flowing wires with consistent color gradients and reflective properties, without breaking or clumping unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hair in Image B displays a continuous flow, resembling metallic strands that move in a realistic manner. The color transitions smoothly from blue to yellow, creating the effect of a consistent gradient. This is complemented by a reflective property that avoids any unnatural clumping or distortion, reinforcing the cohesive metallic aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform, neutral gray tone with no visible remnants of the original setting or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a uniform, neutral gray tone that remains consistent without any irregularities or remnants of the original scene. The lighting across the background is even, without creating unwanted shadows or highlights that might distract from the main subject.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all edited regions—armor, hair, and background—seamlessly integrated with smooth transitions and no visible artifacts like pixelation or mismatched edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited regions concerning the armor, hair, and background have been managed with careful consideration, leading to a seamless integration. Transitions between these elements appear smooth, free from noticeable artifacts like pixelation or mismatched edges, which usually undermine the overall realism of an edited image. The detailing and blending are consistent throughout.",
