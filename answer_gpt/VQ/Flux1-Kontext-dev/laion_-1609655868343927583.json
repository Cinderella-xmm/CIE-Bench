    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the gemstone inlays embedded into the crown surface without visible gaps or floating elements, and does the crown retain the original curvature of the marble top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crown features gemstone inlays that appear to be securely embedded into its surface with no gaps or indications of floating. The curvature of the crown matches the original semicircular shape seen in the marble top in Image A. The integration of the stones and the preservation of the original shape demonstrate attention to detail and adherence to the original curvature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the robe follow the original cabinet’s curved sides and tapering shape, and do the fabric folds and patterns flow naturally without sharp breaks or artificial lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe mirrors the curvature and tapering shape of the cabinet seen in Image A. The patterns and fabric folds are designed to flow seamlessly along the curves of the robe, avoiding sharp breaks or artificially imposed lines. This continuity mimics the original structure and finish of the curved side cabinet.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the drawer engravings positioned at the waistline as belt buckles, aligned with the robe’s structure, and connected with visible straps or fastenings that appear physically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drawer engravings are positioned around the waist area, resembling belt buckles. However, there are no visible straps or fastenings that attach them plausibly to the robe’s structure. Their alignment as decorative elements does not reflect a functional attachment system.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the clawed feet maintain the original leg length and thickness, and are the claws proportionally sized and fully touching the ground without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the original leg length and thickness seen in the cabinet legs in Image A. The claws are designed to be proportionally sized and make contact with the ground, avoiding any sense of detachment or misalignment, thereby faithfully transforming the cabinet legs into legs with claws.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the drawer openings transformed into pouches with visible flap closures and stitching, and do they hang from the robe with realistic weight and attachment points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drawers maintain their original form as openings without transformation into pouches with flap closures or stitching. They are held independently by the figure’s hands and not connected to the robe as an attached element, lacking realistic attachment points and weight portrayal.",
