      "question": "Does the transition area between the painting and the wall maintain the natural texture of the wall material without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When evaluating Image B, one should focus on the border area where the painting meets the wall. The texture of the wall should appear continuous and consistent, with no abrupt changes or artifacts that would suggest editing errors. Common sense tells us that a smooth transition is typical in professional hanging of artwork, and Image B shows a seamless transition area. Image A analysis confirms similar texture consistency in the wall surfaces. Hence, Image B maintains the natural wall texture without introducing any artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the trees and water in the painting maintained realistically without appearing stretched or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting's depiction of trees and water should maintain natural proportions, meaning they should not appear excessively elongated or compressed. The painting depicts a balanced scene where trees have natural height and water flows in a natural horizontal spread, creating a realistic depiction. Comparing with Image A, it maintains the same realism in proportions, supporting a conclusion that there are no distortions present in Image B.",

      "question": "Do the shadows and lighting in the painting align consistently with the room's light source, avoiding unnatural contrasts or disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows shadows and lighting within the painting that appear harmonious and consistent with the light source in the room. This is evident as the light from the room seems to naturally complement the sunset portrayed in the painting. If the light source or shadows were irregular, there would be noticeable contrast. Image A exhibits similar alignment between the room and painting light elements, reinforcing that Image B maintains consistent lighting.",

      "question": "Does the painting preserve its depth and layering, creating a believable 3D effect without disrupting its visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depth and layering of the elements in the painting should contribute to a realistic 3D effect, with proper shading and overlapping planes that create perspective. The sunset between the trees and the water provides atmospheric depth and layering. Similar depth and layering can be observed in Image A, indicating that Image B retains visual coherence.",

      "question": "Does the frame around the painting retain its structural integrity and material appearance without visible damage or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frame in Image B should appear intact and display a consistent material without signs of wear, damage, or textures that seem altered. The frame in the image looks undamaged and retains its appearance, providing a natural border to the painting. Image A shows the same structural fidelity and intact material in the frame, which supports the conclusion for Image B.",
