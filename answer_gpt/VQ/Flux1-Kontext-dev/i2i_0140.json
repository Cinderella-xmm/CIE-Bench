      "question": "Do the quilts' patterns maintain their structural consistency and detailed appearance without unnatural texture disruption after conversion to a watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilts exhibit a conversion to a watercolor style, noticeable in their blurred and softened edges. However, the geometric and floral patchwork patterns are still discernible. Typically, the transition to watercolor introduces a certain softness and blending in textures, common knowledge points to the fact that watercolor styles often maintain clear outlines of shapes and patterns while incorporating subtle blending. Thus, the quilts retain structural consistency in their design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the colors of the bedding and surrounding elements been naturally blended into the watercolor style without appearing unnaturally muted or overly vivid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a watercolor style that generally softens colors. The bedding and surrounding elements exhibit blended colors typical of watercolor, where hues appear softer but maintain a balance without excessive dulling or oversaturation. By analyzing the elements like pillows and quilt patterns, they retain their vibrant colors within a stylized softness, achieving a natural blending effect.",

      "question": "Do the nightstand, picture frames, and flowers retain their natural shapes and material textures without distortion or unnatural artifacts in the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nightstand, picture frames, and flowers are represented with softened textures typical of watercolor style. Despite this stylization, their fundamental shapes and distinct features remain intact. The nightstand retains its rectangular form, the frames preserve their geometry, and the flowers maintain a rounded appearance. Thus, the watercolor effect does not distort their natural shapes excessively.",

      "question": "Are the relative positions and proportions of the beds, nightstand, and wall pictures consistent and visually plausible in the watercolor illustration style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout in Image B mirrors a realistic bedroom setup, displaying consistent relative positions and proportions of the beds, nightstand, and wall pictures. Watercolor illustrations often abstract fine details but still retain compositional plausibility. Here, visual observation confirms the proportional harmony between elements characteristic of realistic bedroom dimensions.",

      "question": "Does the quilt's intricate patchwork design stay recognizable and free from distortion or unnatural simplification in the watercolor illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The quilt's patchwork in Image B is softened in the watercolor illustration, yet it retains recognizable elements such as geometric and floral designs. Watercolor often implies abstraction, yet retains key patterns and motifs. Image B demonstrates intelligible patchwork despite stylization, avoiding excessive simplification.",
