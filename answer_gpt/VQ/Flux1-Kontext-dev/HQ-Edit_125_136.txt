    "Question": "Q1: Are the shapes of the astronaut's helmet, suit segments, and life support pack simplified but still geometrically consistent with their original forms without jagged or broken edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is depicted in a cartoon style with simplified shapes to match the overall comic aesthetic. Despite this simplification, the helmet, suit segments, and life support pack maintain their basic geometric consistency. This means they are rounded and smooth without any jagged or broken edges, consistent with the typical features of an astronaut suit.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the texture applied to the spacesuit appear uniformly distributed and physically plausible, without unnatural repetition or artificial pattern artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The design in Image B is a cartoon that does not focus on realistic texture detailing but emphasizes visual simplicity and uniform color blocking. This results in a stylistically clean presentation without any noticeable unnatural textures or repeating patterns, especially in a cartoon context.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the accent gold colors confined to specific design elements (such as patch borders or connectors) and do they blend naturally without color bleed into adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the use of color is very controlled and purposeful. Accent colors, including gold, are applied to small details such as symbols and logos. The artwork style ensures these colors remain within their designated zones without bleeding into other regions, maintaining visual clarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the directional arrows show clear movement from the astronaut toward the ISS without overlapping or distorting the astronautâ€™s limbs or the station structure?",
    "explanation": "The directional arrows in Image B are used to indicate movement and flow. These arrows clearly guide the viewer's eye from the astronaut toward the ISS. They do not overlap with or distort any critical elements like the astronaut's limbs or the space station structure, which is crucial for maintaining narrative readability in the comic format.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the text positioned at the bottom edge of the image without covering critical parts of the Moon or ISS, and is it clearly readable without distortion or shadow effects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, text positioning is strategic to ensure it does not overlap with important visual elements. The text is clearly readable and placed strategically in the design layout, not at the very bottom edge but in relation to the comic panels. It maintains clarity without distortion and does not interfere with the visual elements of the Moon or the ISS.",
    "answer": "Yes"
