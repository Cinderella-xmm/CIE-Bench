      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the elephant have clear, smooth edges without visible artifacts, distortions, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case is visible around the elephant. The edges appear well-defined and smooth, suggesting care in rendering. There are no apparent unnatural reflections or distortions in the structure. This analysis relies on recognizing that glass cases typically have these characteristics if crafted skillfully.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the metallic resin details on the elephantâ€™s armor consistently textured and reflective, showing no unnatural glossiness or broken patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's armor has intricate metallic details. The texture appears consistently smooth and matches the reflective quality expected of crafted armor, without signs of broken patterns or excessive shine. These observations align with common characteristics of metal wear which include a balance of glossiness and texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the silk-gold banners located at the four corners of the glass case, properly anchored, and displaying natural fabric draping and color variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silk-gold banners appear at the corners of the glass display case. The banners are anchored properly and show natural folds typical of draping fabric, along with subtle color variation that would be present in silk material due to lighting influences.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the layered mountain silhouettes in the background show gradual opacity and depth, with no sharp edges or inconsistent transparency levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain silhouettes in the background provide a sense of depth due to their gradual opacity transitions. They do not show sharp or harsh edges, maintaining a smooth gradient typical of distant landscape scenes that rely on atmospheric perspective.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bonsai-like trees at the foreground edges realistically integrated into the rocky surface, with natural leaf textures and root placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bonsai-like trees seem integrated realistically into the rocky surface, as evidenced by the accurate placement of roots and the natural appearance of the leaf textures. The integration appears congruent with common landscaping practices where bonsai trees have a careful root system for balance and natural integration.",
