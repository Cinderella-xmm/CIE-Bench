      "question": "Does the glass-like surface of the transformed Eiffel Tower show natural transparency and subtle reflections consistent with real glass under overcast lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower has been transformed into a perfume bottle with a glass-like surface. The lighting appears overcast, with smooth reflections that suggest a realistic glass material. These reflections are consistent with typical glass behavior under such lighting conditions, where the transparency and subtle reflections are subdued and not excessively shiny, which is characteristic of glass in dim lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the embossed patterns on the glass surface aligned with the original lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower and proportionally consistent across all levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the Eiffel Tower has a complex lattice structure that provides structural integrity and visual aesthetic. In Image B, these elements are replaced by a smooth glass surface, and any embossed patterns that may be present don't appear prominently, suggesting that the original lattice has been largely overwritten or simplified in the glass design. There's no indication of the original lattice structure being effectively mirrored in embossed patterns on the bottle.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold-plated base positioned correctly at the bottom of the tower, with smooth edges and consistent metallic texture that matches the scale and lighting of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neck and cap of the perfume bottle are gold-plated. The base doesn't appear specifically gold-plated; instead, the transparent design runs throughout the image. The metallic texture observed at the neck matches the overcast scene in lighting, but considering no distinct base in gold-plating is observed at the bottom, we assume that the question may be referring to elements misunderstood as such.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Parisian skyline motif visible along the glass surface without distorting the towerâ€™s shape or appearing as a floating or disconnected element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Parisian skyline and the Eiffel Tower are visible through the transparency and are integrated into the curvatures of the glass bottle. The motif is clearly visible and doesn't appear distorted or floating. The skyline maintains a consistent visual relationship relative to the transformed tower's scale and position, blending coherently with the entire scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the logo at the neck of the bottle clearly defined, centered, and free from jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo is positioned around the neck of the perfume bottle and appears clearly defined and centered. Its edges are smooth and free from any pixelation or texture artifacts, maintaining high visual integrity under scrutiny.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the main structural elements of the tower (legs, arches, central column) preserved in correct proportion and alignment, with no signs of stretching or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower has been transformed and replaced by a glass bottle structure. The original tower's structural elements like legs, arches, and columns are no longer preserved in the typical sense due to this transformation, which reshapes these elements into a glass mold rather than the original proportionate architecture. Thus, geometric proportions as per the original design are not maintained; instead, adaptation into bottle form is observed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as pixelation, color bleeding, or unnatural reflections around the transformed tower or its components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, upon analysis, does not show any visible artifacts like pixelation, color bleeding, or unnatural reflections. The transformed Eiffel Tower maintains visual smoothness across its surface, with consistent color and reflection behaviors indicative of well-edited image quality. The reflections and lighting are cohesive with the glass surface's intended appearance, ensuring a natural transition from tower to glass bottle form.",
