      "question": "Are the cogs and gears forming the nest properly aligned and interlocked, showing no visible gaps or floating elements that break geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cogs and gears form the structure of the nest around the stork. Examining these mechanical components requires attention to the way they fit together. Proper alignment and interlocking would mean that the cogs appear to mesh and the gears integrate smoothly, creating a coherent structure without gaps or floating elements. The nest in Image B mostly shows well-aligned components, but there might be minor misalignments or gaps due to artistic rendering, which would break the continuity expected in a mechanical structure.",

      "question": "Do the copper pipes run along the roof edges in a physically plausible manner, with consistent thickness and no abrupt bends or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the copper pipes are an addition to the visual design, running along the edges of the roof. For these to be physically plausible, the pipes should have a consistent thickness throughout, follow the roof lines without abrupt, unrealistic bends, and should be supported rather than floating. The design appears to integrate these pipes logically, with proper adherence to the roof structure and no visible floating sections, thus maintaining physical plausibility.",

      "question": "Are the metallic plates covering the stork’s body arranged in a way that follows the underlying anatomy, without unnatural overlaps or gaps between plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stork in Image B has metallic plates covering its body. These plates should mimic the natural contour and structure of the bird's anatomy to maintain a sense of believability. Proper arrangement would mean that the plates fit seamlessly over the body, without disrupting the natural shape or showing gaps. In this artistic depiction, the plates do seem to follow the curvature of the stork without noticeable mismatches or gaps, indicating that they maintain the natural anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical joints at the stork’s neck, wing, and leg connections properly shaped and positioned to match the movement range of a real bird, without appearing distorted or misplaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical aspects of the stork involve joint connections at critical movement points such as neck, wings, and legs. For these joints to match the expected movement range of a real bird, they would need to be appropriately positioned and shaped, allowing for typical bird movements without distortion or misplacement. The Image B depiction maintains the appearance of realistic bird movement anatomy, indicating that the joints are reasonably well configured.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the integration of mechanical elements (cogs, pipes) with the wooden house maintain proportional harmony and avoid elements that appear disproportionately large or suspended without support?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical elements in Image B, such as cogs and pipes, are integrated with the wooden structure of the house. To ensure proportional harmony, these elements should not appear disproportionately large nor seem to be unsupported. The visual in Image B demonstrates a balanced integration where the mechanical elements match the scale of the house and appear supported, thus maintaining a coherent visual harmony.",
