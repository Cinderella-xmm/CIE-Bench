    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed book maintain consistent proportions and structural integrity when opened into a pop-up form, without warped edges or floating components?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the book is seen inside a cloche and appears to be part of a display setup, maintaining a closed form with detailed embossing on its cover. It does not appear opened into a pop-up form, nor is there any indication of warped edges or floating components in its current presentation. Thus, the question of transformation and consistency is not applicable, as the book is not depicted in an opened state, nor are visible signs of structural alterations presented.",
