      "question": "Does the boundary where the character appears to break out of the television screen show no obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted as part of the screen projecting outward, creating a 3D effect. The boundary where the character appears to break through the screen shows a smooth transition without visible artifacts or jagged edges, maintaining a coherent look. This suggests that the image editing was done with care to ensure natural blending.",

      "question": "Is the shield held in a manner that complements the character's posture without introducing distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shield is held in front of the character, aligned with the posture. The circular shape of the shield is consistently maintained, and there are no signs of distortion. The design and reflections on the shield look proportionate and geometrically correct, suggesting that it complements the character's stance.",

      "question": "Are the lighting and reflections on the character's suit consistent with the environment, avoiding any loss of details or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's suit has consistent lighting with the indoor setting, which is typical when the character is depicted in a screen-like environment. Light reflects off the metallic parts of the suit realistically, and the textures are well-preserved, avoiding unnatural appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s body parts are well-proportioned, with no evidence of distortion or scaling that looks unnatural. The character's stance and limb lengths conform to realistic human proportions, maintaining visual coherence.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character breaking out of the screen appears well-integrated into the scene. The screen's design and surrounding environment remain undisturbed by the character's presence, preserving the visual flow of the image without any disruptive elements.",
