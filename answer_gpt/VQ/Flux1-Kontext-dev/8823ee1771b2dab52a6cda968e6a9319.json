      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While assessing the edited image (Image B), the proportions of the figurine's face seem anatomically correct. There are no signs of warping, distortion, or any irregularity that would suggest incorrect proportions. This conclusion is drawn by analyzing the positioning and size of the features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth, relative to typical human facial anatomy.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the folds of the dress are depicted with smooth, continuous surfaces, which mimic the qualities of glazed porcelain.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand in Image B appears to be positioned naturally on the column, maintaining contact with it. There are no visual cues indicating any floating or clipped fingers. This assessment is made by examining the alignment and placement of the fingers in relation to the column and the overall anatomy of the hand.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the decorative patterns on the mantle and column are clearly defined and appear appropriately scaled for a miniature setting. The precision and detail of these patterns suggest they have been adapted while maintaining clarity and proportion suitable to the figurine's scale.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the figurine is well-aligned with the surrounding elements. The lighting and perspective across the scene are consistent, indicating that the base integrates naturally into the environment. This conclusion is drawn from evaluating how the base reflects and interacts with the lighting conditions and perspective used throughout the image.",
