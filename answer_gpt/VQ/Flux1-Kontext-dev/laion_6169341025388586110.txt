    "Question": "Q1: Does the statue exhibit a consistent clay-like texture across all body parts, including the face, limbs, and torso, without visible patches of mismatched material or unnatural graininess?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is enclosed in a glass dome and exhibits a clay-like texture that is uniform across its body. The visual elements are consistent, with no bizarre patches or transitions between materials, indicating that the texture is applied evenly throughout. This observation aligns with the appearance of a cohesive material application.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the glass dome fully transparent with no visible distortion of the statue's shape or features behind it, and does it display natural reflections and refractions consistent with real glass?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a statue inside a glass dome. The dome appears fully transparent, allowing clear visibility of the statue's shapes and features without noticeable distortion. The reflections and refractions on the surface of the dome are indicative of real glass’s reflective properties, appearing natural and unintrusive.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the lotus and wave patterns on the glass dome evenly spaced, clearly defined, and integrated smoothly into the surface without overlapping or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "The patterns on the glass dome in Image B, specifically the lotus and wave motifs, are evenly distributed around the dome, providing a balanced artistic design. They are clearly defined, with smooth lines and no visible overlapping or jagged edges, indicating a high level of detail in their placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the trident, snake, and drum exhibit enhanced golden highlights under the spotlight without visible halo effects, color bleeding, or overexposed areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trident, snake, and drum are highlighted with a gleaming golden finish. The highlights are vibrant yet controlled, avoiding haloing or color bleeding, and the exposure is balanced, presenting these elements with clarity and emphasis without overexposure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the muscle contours on the statue’s arms, chest, and legs accurately shaded with smooth gradients that follow the underlying anatomy and directional light source?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates well-defined muscle contours on the statue, with shading that accurately follows the form and mimics a natural light source. The smooth gradients enhance the perceived depth and three-dimensionality of the body, aligning with realistic anatomy representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the incense holders positioned at ground level around the base of the pedestal, correctly scaled, and free from floating or clipping against other structures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the incense holders are placed at the base level of the pedestal. The holders are scaled appropriately in relation to the statue and the surrounding environment, sitting securely without appearing to float or intersect awkwardly with other elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
