    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the outfits, backpacks, and skiing gear of the chibi-style skiers appear consistent with the original design and maintain their structural integrity without any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outfits, backpacks, and skiing gear appear to be stylized to fit the chibi-style character design. The use of exaggerated proportions and smoother lines is typical in chibi art, where realism is often less emphasized in favor of a more cartoonish appearance. This approach generally maintains structural integrity, as the elements are proportionate within this style, without visible distortions that would typically indicate errors or flaws.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and details of the skiers' outfits, backpacks, and skiing gear preserved well, without any noticeable loss or unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the chibi-style tends to simplify and smooth textures for a more stylized look, the elements such as the outfits, backpacks, and skiing gear show well-defined shapes and clean lines, typical for animation or cartoon design. There is not a high focus on intricate textures because of the inherently simpler aesthetic of chibi style. Hence, there is no noticeable artifact, and detail simplicity is intentional.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the snowy forest setting and the arrangement of environmental elements like trees and snow remain authentic and undistorted, contributing to the overall natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowy forest setting, including trees and snow, maintains a coherent layout similar to Image A but adopts a chibi or stylized aesthetic. The environment is consistent in representation, and the arrangement does not show any distortions that would detract from its natural appearance, considering the context of stylized art.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the chibi-style skiers' bodies relative to their surroundings physically rational and free from any geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In chibi-style design, characters are often drawn with intentionally exaggerated and disproportionate features (large heads, small bodies). However, within this style's context, Image B depicts proportionate elements typical for this art form. There appear to be no unintended distortions that deviate from the artistic conventions of chibi-style, and the figures are visually balanced within their snowy environment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the edited image, including the skiers, the snowy path, and the surrounding forest, maintain visual credibility without any inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition in Image B maintains visual credibility consistent with stylized art conventions, where simplicity and exaggerated proportions are inherent attributes. The arrangement of the skiers, path, and forest elements are coherent and balanced within the image frame, contributing to an organized and intentional visual style without inconsistencies.",
