      "question": "Does the fur texture on the side of the cat appear smooth and consistent with the texture on the front part without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized drawing of a cat with fur textures represented through lines and shading, consistent with an artistic depiction rather than a photo-realistic texture. In this context, the texture appears smooth and consistent throughout the depiction of both the front and side views of the cat. The drawing uses simplified line work to maintain uniformity, which is typical for illustrations. Since the question is about consistency and avoiding unnatural artifacts, this illustration maintains a uniform style without any jarring inconsistencies or visual artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cat's front and side views proportionally aligned without any noticeable distortion or overlapping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each view of the cat is distinct and properly separated within its panel, which suggests that the proportions of the cat from both angles align proportionally, adhering to the visual consistency expected in an artistic interpretation. The absence of overlapping shapes or distortions that might indicate a conflict between views further supports their proportional alignment. The design keeps a consistent style which avoids any visual artifacts across both views.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cat's eyes and ears retain their natural shape and detail, free from any visible artifacts or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stylized artistic depiction in Image B presents the cat's eyes and ears with clear lines and defined shapes. These elements are drawn to be prominent features and retain a distinct and natural shape typical for illustration styles, without any pixelation or blurring. The consistent line work and clean presentation ensure that these features are free from artifacts one might associate with digital image manipulation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a continuous and natural transition where the front and side views of the cat meet, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or awkward intersections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, forms are represented via two separate panels showing different views of the cat. Since these are not merged in a single continuous scene but rather juxtaposed independently within the image format, there is no transition area to assess. The distinct separation avoids any issues with broken geometries or awkward intersections common to digitally manipulated images attempting to show multiple viewpoints in one frame.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall posture and positioning of the cat in the combined image remain plausible and natural, without introducing any unnatural bending or stretching of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents two distinct and separate views of the cat within this illustration setup, each providing a clear view without merging or transitioning between them. Each pose is individually plausible within its panel, with both the front and side depictions maintaining typical feline postures that stay true to the stylization. There are no visible disruptions in anatomy or perspective given the separated presentation format.",
