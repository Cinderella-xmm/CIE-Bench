      "question": "Does the transformed book maintain consistent proportions and structural integrity when opened into a pop-up form, without warped edges or floating components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is seen inside a cloche and appears to be part of a display setup, maintaining a closed form with detailed embossing on its cover. It does not appear opened into a pop-up form, nor is there any indication of warped edges or floating components in its current presentation. Thus, the question of transformation and consistency is not applicable, as the book is not depicted in an opened state, nor are visible signs of structural alterations presented.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the quill positioned centrally and vertically as a stable pivot, with natural feather texture and metallic base that match the original materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quill is positioned vertically in a stand to the right of the book, similar to its position in Image A. It continues to have a natural feather texture and a metallic base, suggesting consistency with original materials. This setup provides stability and aligns with common presentation styles for decorative quills.",

      "question": "Does the inkwellâ€™s transformation into a fountain include realistic water flow and surface reflections without unnatural highlights or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the inkwell retains its original form without undergoing transformation into a fountain. It displays a consistent appearance with highlights and reflections matching a glass inkwell, but without depictions of water flow or broken geometry that would be characteristic of a fountain structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the glass cloche transparent and free of distortion, with smooth curvature and accurate light refraction across all internal elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the glass cloche effectively demonstrates transparency and lacks distortion, allowing detailed viewing of the internal elements such as the book, quill, and other components. Its smooth curvature ensures consistent refraction and highlights that suggest realistic handling of light effects. This presentation is common for decorative objects encased in glass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the engraved lines on the wooden base continuous, legible, and integrated with the wood texture without sharp breaks or unnatural depth variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base beneath the glass cloche does not exhibit visible engraved lines, focused mainly on providing a solid platform for the display. The perceived texture is uniform and consistent without any visible sharp breaks or depth variations that would indicate engraving. It serves its purpose effectively as a display base.",
