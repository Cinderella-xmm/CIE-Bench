      "question": "Are the added cogs and gears on the lamp's armature properly aligned with the existing structure, maintaining consistent proportions and smooth transitions without visible seams or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the added gears on the lamp's armature appear to be well-integrated into the design, with consistent proportions in relation to the lamp's structure. There are no visible seams or texture mismatches, and the gears seem to be seamlessly connected to the armature, suggesting a cohesive design. In terms of structural logic, the gears are similar in style to the ornate patterns on the lamp, maintaining visual consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the page edges of the open book display cog-like patterns that are integrated seamlessly into the paper texture without distorting the natural curl or layering of the pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the open book shows cog-like patterns on the page edges, which are seamlessly blended into the natural texture of the paper. The natural curl and layering of the pages remain undistorted, giving the appearance that the cog patterns are a natural extension of the page design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rivet patterns applied to the floral wallpaper evenly spaced and dimensionally consistent with the wall surface, without causing distortions in the flower shapes or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, there are no visible rivet patterns applied to the floral wallpaper. The floral designs appear intact without any added rivet patterns. Therefore, there is no question of even spacing or dimensional consistency of non-existent rivets.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the color tone of the edited elements (lamp, books, wallpaper) consistent with the original warm vintage palette, showing no abrupt shifts in hue or brightness that disrupt visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color tones of the edited elements such as the lamp, books, and wallpaper maintain a warm vintage palette similar to Image A. There are no noticeable abrupt shifts in hue or brightness; the overall visual harmony is preserved. The lamp retains its ornate appearance, the books display consistent aging effects, and the wallpaper blends smoothly, maintaining the overall ambiance of the original image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the mechanical additions (cogs, gears, rivets) proportionally scaled and structurally anchored to existing surfaces, avoiding floating or misaligned components that break spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the added mechanical elements like cogs and gears are proportionally scaled relative to the lamp and seamlessly integrated into the existing structure. They are structurally anchored to the lampâ€™s armature, with no components visibly floating or misaligned. This maintains the spatial logic and coherence of the image.",
