      "question": "Are the mosaic tiles uniformly distributed across the entire surface of both teddy bears, maintaining consistent size and alignment without visible gaps or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic tiles cover the surface of the teddy bears in a way that suggests a deliberate pattern. However, the tiles do not appear completely uniform across the entire surface; there are visible variations in the distribution. The tiles do maintain a level of alignment, but there are small gaps and irregularities that can be observed. This suggests that the tiles are not uniformly distributed.",

      "question": "Do the yellow and turquoise tile patterns on the sweaters follow the original shape and contours of the garments without warping or breaking geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow and turquoise tile patterns on the sweaters generally follow the original shape and contour of the garments. The mosaic tiles are applied in a manner that aligns with the curvature of the sweaters, maintaining a resemblance to the original knitted texture. There is no significant warping or breaking of geometric shapes that disrupts the overall appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) clearly defined and proportionally correct using shaded tiles, without blurring or misalignment that compromises recognition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the teddy bears are constructed using shaded mosaic tiles. These features, including the eyes, nose, and mouth, remain clearly defined and are proportionally correct. The tiles are placed to preserve the recognizability of the facial expressions, without blurring or misalignment affecting their clarity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bows retain their original shape and appear with a smooth, reflective surface that contrasts naturally with the surrounding mosaic fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bows on both teddy bears maintain their original shape, and they are depicted with a smooth texture that contrasts with the mosaic-tiled fur. The smoothness and reflectiveness mimic the original satin texture from Image A, providing a distinct difference from the mosaic surface of the rest of the teddy bears.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the white pedestal fully grounded beneath the bears, with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does it maintain clean edges and uniform color without blending issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white pedestal on which the teddy bears are placed appears properly grounded. There are no visible gaps or floating effects, and the edges of the pedestal are clean and well-defined. The color is uniform, with no blending issues, providing a solid base for the presentation of the bears.",
