    "Question": "Q1: Do the feathered wing extensions on the sides of the door maintain consistent wood grain and carving depth, with smooth transitions from the original panel edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the door is overlaid with elaborate feathered wing extensions on each side. The wood grain and carving depth are interrupted by the feathers, which appear as separate, magical elements added to the structure. The colors and materials of the wings distinctively differ from the original wooden texture. Thus, visual continuity between the wings and the door’s original wood grain and carving depth is not maintained, indicating that the transition is not smooth from the original panel edges.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the shimmering eyes formed from the iron studs aligned with their original positions and embedded within the wood without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the door retains the iron studs from Image A, but there are no known shimmering eyes replacing them. The studs appear consistent with their original positions, maintaining alignment and being embedded within the wood as in the first image. The positioning and embedding process shows precision and intentional placement, indicating that there are no floating or incorrect overlaps.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the celestial crown emerging from the arch maintain continuous curvature and seamless integration with the original arch shape, without broken lines or floating pieces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a celestial crown is prominent above the door. This crown is visually distinct from the architectural elements of the arch. It features complex elements like curves and points that do not align or seamlessly integrate with the original arch shape. The integration shows a clear divide where the crown's base meets the arch, suggesting that this element was added rather than flawlessly integrated.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the etched runes visible across the door’s surface consistent in depth, color, and lighting with the original carvings, and do they not cover or distort existing patterns?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the original door carvings are maintained, and there is no prominent presence of added etched runes. The existing patterns and carvings are seen to be consistent in depth, color, and lighting compared to Image A. Therefore, the original patterns are not covered or distorted by any new etched runes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the cloak-like structure around the doorframe exhibit natural fabric folds with consistent lighting and shadow, and does it maintain connection to the original stone frame without gaps or distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a blue cloak-like structure is added around the door. It exhibits natural-looking fabric folds and depth, with shadows aligning with the lighting, enhancing realism. Additionally, the cloak appears to wrap around the doorframe, maintaining a connection to the original structure without visible gaps or distortions. The visual effects create a cohesive integration with consistent lighting and shadow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
