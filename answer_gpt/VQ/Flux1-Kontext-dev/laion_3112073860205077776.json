      "question": "Are the illustrated blueberries and text labels seamlessly integrated into the pie surface without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustrated blueberries and text labels in Image B appear to be added elements that have been placed on or near the pie representation. The blueberries are characterized by clean lines typically associated with illustrations, as opposed to realistic depictions. The text labels accompanying them are clear and do not show pixelation, and they seem to be well-positioned without mismatching shadows or outlines. Given the cartoon-style design, they seem intentionally integrated rather than needing seamless blending as a realistic photo might. Analyzing these design choices indicates that the illustration style does not require seamless integration as it embraces a different artistic aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the anthropomorphic version of the mug retain the original cylindrical shape and handle position without stretching, warping, or breaking the object's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anthropomorphic version of the mug is indeed depicted with a cylindrical shape, similar to standard mugs, and its handle is appropriately positioned. The visual representation uses a cartoony style that preserves the object form without distortion that impacts shape recognition. The mug maintains its structural integrity without signs of stretching or warping, adhering closely to a playful animated format that still respects the original proportions and orientation one would expect in a mug.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the chart positioned clearly within the frame without overlapping or obscuring the pie slice, mug, or plate, and does it have clean lines and legible text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chart in Image B is placed on a dedicated section of the design layout, ensuring no overlap with key objects such as the pie slice, mug, or plate. It has well-defined bars and clean lines, indicative of clear design planning. Additionally, the text associated with the chart is legible, although creatively styled, maintaining readability. The design's structure allows for clarity without interference from the other major components of the image.",

      "question": "Are the warm pastel tones applied evenly across the scene without causing unnatural discoloration of the ceramic, glass, or baked pie surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a warm pastel tone palette consistently across its entirety, lending a soft, unified aesthetic popular in playful, stylized design work. The tones do not distort the identity or expected material characteristics of individual components, such as the pie surface or mug. The consistent application of hues ensures that elements like the ceramic and the pie retain their visual essence despite the illustrative style. Therefore, there is no resulting unnatural discoloration impacting the depicted objects.",

      "question": "Do the pie slice, mug, plate, and table maintain their original geometric forms and spatial relationships without any visible warping, fragmentation, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all key components—namely the pie slice, mug, plate, and table—retain their geometric integrity. Their spatial relationships are preserved, avoiding any impression of warping or fragmentation. This consistency is owed to the disciplined cartoon-like style employed, which respects the proportionality and alignment expected of these objects. Their representation balances playful reinterpretation with maintenance of structural form.",
