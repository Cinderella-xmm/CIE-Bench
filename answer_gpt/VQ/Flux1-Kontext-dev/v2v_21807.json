      "question": "Are the clock faces and architectural details of the tower clearly visible and structurally consistent despite the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock faces and architectural details of the tower are distinctly rendered in a simplified, cartoon style. The clock faces are clear and the key architectural elements such as the roof and columns are retained. Although the cartoon depiction is stylized, the structural consistency with the original design is maintained, evident from the observable features being preserved albeit in a simplified form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the clock tower and surrounding elements retain their natural textures without any noticeable loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces are depicted with solid colors and bold outlines typical of cartoon art. This style inherently removes natural textures and details present in real-world images, trading them for simplified, untextured surfaces. Thus, natural textures are not preserved in this artistic style.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image avoid introducing any unnatural artifacts or distortions in the clock tower and its surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation to a cartoon style inherently changes the appearance, but does not introduce unnatural artifacts or distortions. The simplification respects the integrity of each element, ensuring clear representation without any distortions that could disrupt the visual coherence or logic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the clock tower and its surroundings logically maintained in the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the proportions and spatial relations seen in the original image. The clock tower's size relative to cars and trees is consistent, reflecting an understanding of dimensional relationships despite stylistic changes associated with cartoon art. The use of perspective and positioning in the scene supports this logical consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the clock tower and its surroundings remain intact and undistorted in the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The geometric shapes in Image B are rendered in a simplified, cartoon manner, but integrity is maintained. The basic shapes like the towerâ€™s vertical silhouette, arches, and the road layout are preserved and accurately depicted, avoiding distortion while adopting the cartoon style's simplification of form.",
