    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the two central tree trunks retain the original towers' vertical proportions and cylindrical form without unnatural tapering or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the central tree trunks are tall and cylindrical, similar to the towers in Image A. They maintain vertical proportions without visible tapering or distortion, showcasing a tree-like transformation while preserving the fundamental architectural shape of the towers.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the branches extending from the trunks seamlessly connected and positioned in a way that follows natural growth patterns, without floating or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branches emanate naturally from the trunks, following typical tree growth patterns. There are no floating segments or misalignment; the branches are visibly integrated into the trunks, consistent with realistic tree structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the glowing leaves at the top of the structure emit a soft, diffused green light that blends with ambient lighting and does not produce sharp halos or overexposed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaves in Image B emit a gentle, diffused green glow that harmonizes with the overall lighting of the scene. There are no sharp halos or excessively bright areas; the light from the leaves appears naturally integrated without overpowering other elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the root-like spirit figures embedded in the ground smoothly blended with the terrain and free of visible pixelation, edge artifacts, or unnatural translucency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spirit figures in Image B appear to be smoothly integrated into the ground. They blend with the terrain without visible pixelation or edge artifacts. Their translucency is artistically crafted, avoiding any unrealistic appearance or digital anomalies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bark textures on the trunks and branches show variation in shading and detail consistent with real tree surfaces, without uniform patterns or repeated brushwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the bark textures on the tree trunks and branches exhibit variations in shading and detailing typical of genuine trees. The textures do not show uniform patterns or repeated brushwork, indicating attention to realistic representation.",
