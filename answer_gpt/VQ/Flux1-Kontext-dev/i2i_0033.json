    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the person retain a natural jumping pose that aligns with typical human biomechanics, avoiding any distortion or unnatural posturing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is depicted in a straightforward standing position, with no indication of jumping or altered posture. The lines and angles suggest he is standing upright, fitting well within typical human biomechanics for a static pose.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bold outlines applied to the person and surrounding elements smooth and continuous, without any jagged edges or breaks that would disrupt the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bold outlines are a crucial part of the artistic style and are drawn smoothly without noticeable breaks or jagged edges. This approach creates a fluid visual experience that is typical of stylized hand-drawn art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the background blend the graffiti and concrete texture effectively, creating an authentic look without overlapping issues or blending that obscures either element's distinct characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a flat, graphic background style, which contains abstract shapes that resemble graffiti art. The simplicity avoids any overlapping or blending issues typical of concrete textures, thereby maintaining distinct and separate elements in the design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the individual's face been preserved authentically within the new artistic style, retaining identifiable features like the eyes, nose, and mouth without distortion or excessive simplification?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Excluding the blurred face, the rest of the features in Image B show a transition into a simplified hand-drawn style. However, the face being blurred prevents evaluation of features such as eyes, nose, and mouth, which makes it impossible to assess preservation or distortion in this context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the details and patterns on the suit, tie, and shirt remain discernible within the hand-drawn style, avoiding any unnatural smudging or loss of defining characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand-drawn style maintains discernible patterns and details on the suit, tie, and shirt. The patterns, although stylized, are depicted clearly without blurring or smudging, ensuring that their defining characteristics are retained.",
