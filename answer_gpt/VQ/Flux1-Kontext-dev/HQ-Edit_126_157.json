      "question": "Does the boat exhibit consistent aged wood texture with natural grain patterns and no repeating or unnatural surface artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boat shows a realistic aged wood texture with visible grain patterns. This suggests the depiction of authentic wooden material typically associated with traditional boats, maintaining a natural appearance without any evident repeating or artificial surface artifacts. Therefore, the visual cues in Image B support a conclusion that the texture is consistent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the distant hills rendered with smooth pastel blue gradients that transition naturally without sharp boundaries or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases distant hills with a smooth transition in pastel blue hues, providing a visually pleasing gradient that lacks harsh edges or pixelation. Such rendering often signifies a well-executed gradient in digital artwork, delivering a soft and natural look. Compared to Image A, which is without any frame or degradation, Image B's hills are appropriately transitioned and have somewhat reduced clarity, likely an effect of being displayed within a frame.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small, clear droplet-like etchings on the water surface that resemble ripples without disrupting the reflection or causing visual distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water surface in Image B does not display clear droplet-like etchings resembling ripples. Instead, the water maintains a smooth reflection without additional details to denote motion or ripple effects, which aligns with a serene environment typically found in such imagery. Comparing with Image A, the water in Image B has a grainy texture which might suggest distortion but not clear droplet-like etchings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a hand-carved wooden frame surrounding the scene with realistic texture, depth, and structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a wooden frame surrounds the scene, providing a sense of depth and realistic texture through visual cues characteristic of hand-carved wood. The frame's structure is coherent, solidifying its design as a genuine wooden frame display. Examining the frame, its details and alignment suggest craftsmanship, supporting the perceived realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the boat, water, and hills arranged in layered 3D cutouts with correct spatial depth and no misalignment or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presentation of the boat, water, and hills in Image B seems to maintain correct spatial depth, suggesting no misalignment or elements appearing disjoint or floating. This is achieved through a true-to-scene perspective, rendering each element appropriately in relation to the others, reinforcing depth. Compared to Image A where elements are within a natural setting, Image B preserves this depth despite its surrounding frame.",
