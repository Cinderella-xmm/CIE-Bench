    "Question": "Q1:Does the addition of the text “Master Chef” and “Final Round” appear naturally integrated without disrupting the overall visual balance of the plate and spoon?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text “Master Chef” and “Final Round” are in white and positioned on a black background, with 'Master Chef' at the top and 'Final Round' at the bottom surrounding the plate. The text's alignment balances the circular plate in the center, maintaining the focus on it while adding context. The font choice is bold, providing clear contrast against the background without detracting from the central spoon and plate. Hence, despite the added elements, the overall visual balance of the image remains centered on the plate and spoon.",
    "answer": "Yes"

The text appears sharp and integrated without any pixelation, distortion, or misalignment. There are no visible artifacts or unnatural textures disrupting the image quality, suggesting that the overlay process has preserved visual aesthetics successfully.",

    "Question": "Q3:Do the text sizes for “Master Chef” and “Final Round” seem proportional and appropriate compared to the scale of the plate and spoon?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the size of the text “Master Chef” and “Final Round” is large enough to be read clearly but does not overwhelm the central image of the plate and spoon. The top text “Master Chef” occupies a substantial part of the background while leaving adequate space for the plate and spoon to stand out. Similarly, “Final Round” is curved around the bottom, adjusting well to the circular orientation without crowding the main objects. The scale appears thoughtfully balanced, ensuring the texts are visible and complementary to the image focus.",

    "explanation": "In Image B, the font style for “Master Chef” and “Final Round” is bold and clear, providing a modern look that matches the sleekness of the plate and spoon.
