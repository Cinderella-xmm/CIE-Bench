      "question": "Does the cat’s body exhibit a smooth, flowing mist-like texture with a consistent sky-blue hue that blends naturally without sharp edges or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's body is depicted with a smooth, flowing texture that mimics a mist-like appearance. The consistent sky-blue hue is applied uniformly across the body, avoiding any sharp edges or pixelated areas that would indicate a lack of blending. The color and texture contribute to a harmonious visual appeal, suggesting a well-executed digital edit.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the swirling cumulus cluster positioned atop the cat’s head in a way that follows natural cloud formation and integrates seamlessly with the head’s shape without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cumulus cluster atop the cat’s head presents an appearance that aligns with natural cloud formations, with swirling patterns that mimic genuine cumulus clouds. The visual connection between the cloud and the cat’s head is seamless, suggesting intentional integration without misalignment or detachment, enhancing the fantasy aesthetic of the cat image.",

      "question": "Are the cloud patterns integrated into the cat’s body in a way that respects the original fur direction and does not cause visible distortion or unnatural layering over the striped pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat’s body showcases cloud patterns that have been integrated with attention to the original fur direction. The connection between the cloud patterns and the cat's body avoids distortion or unnatural layering that would suggest conflict with original elements like stripes, providing a coherent design that maintains the image's natural flow.",

      "question": "Do the translucent wings have a soft, ethereal appearance with subtle cloud swirls and are they attached to the cat’s body in a way that preserves anatomical plausibility and spatial consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays translucent wings that have a soft, ethereal quality. The wings feature subtle cloud swirls, blending into a cohesive artistic element. These wings adhere to the cat’s body in a manner that maintains anatomical plausibility and spatial consistency, suggesting an adept awareness of visual harmony and fantasy design.",

      "question": "Are the vapor trails and eye swirls smoothly rendered and aligned with the cat’s facial contours, avoiding jagged lines or misplaced streaks that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vapor trails aligned with the eye swirls are smoothly rendered and conform to the facial contours of the cat. There are no evident jagged lines or misplaced streaks, suggesting careful digital execution that avoids any artifacts which would detract from the professional finish of the image.",
