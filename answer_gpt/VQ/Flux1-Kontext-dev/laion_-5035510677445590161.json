      "question": "Does the explorer coat have a consistent fabric texture with visible stitching and leather accents that appear physically plausible and free of obvious digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the visual cues from Image B, the explorer coat is crafted with a clear and coherent texture showcasing distinct fabric and leather accents, with visible stitching that portrays a realistic finish. There are no noticeable digital artifacts disrupting the authenticity of the fabric texture, supporting the physical plausibility. Comparing the visual structure of such coats commonly including leather accents and smooth stitching, the edited image maintains plausibility without obvious anomalies.",

      "question": "Is the tricorn hat properly shaped with three distinct points, correctly sized for the head, and casting a natural shadow consistent with the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, the tricorn hat distinctly exhibits three points suggestive of its classic shape, demonstrating an appropriate fitting over the head in correlation with common sizing practices. The lighting and shadow on the hat reflect congruency with the light source direction, eliminating any inconsistencies which might suggest digital alterations. The overall visualization of the hat adheres to physical and lighting norms for this type of headgear.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates five fingers within the leather gauntlet, with bends appearing naturally in alignment with typical anatomy. The fingers extend comfortably out of the sleeve, which joins seamlessly without displaying visible seams or distortions. The quality of gauntlet integrates realistically with the extended arm, observing proper garment anatomy and connection.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the snowy mountain background fits seamlessly with the subject, maintaining uniformity in lighting and depth cues matching the scene’s ambiance.

      "question": "Are the facial features, including the beard, glasses, and skin tone, preserved without distortion, and do they receive lighting consistent with the direction and quality of light in the snowy mountain scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features that can be assessed include the beard which is aligned consistently with the light and maintains a realistic texture without distortion. Although detailed facial features are blurred, the surrounding elements such as beard lighting suggest congruence with the light direction and quality present in the scene. This consistency supports natural lighting integration.",
