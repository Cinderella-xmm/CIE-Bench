      "question": "Does the lionâ€™s silhouette maintain correct anatomical proportions and smooth edge definition without visible pixelation or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion's silhouette is analyzed by observing its overall shape and details. The lion appears to have a strong, majestic posture typical of a lion's natural stance. The edges of the silhouette are smooth and continuous, with no visible pixelation or distortion affecting its anatomical correctness. The front legs, mane, and tail are well-defined, indicating accurate proportions and smooth edges.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the color transitions in the abstract gradient backdrop smooth and free from visible banding or unnatural color boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop consists of a gradient transitioning from dark to bright hues around the horizon line, reminiscent of a sunset. These transitions are smooth, with a natural blend from deep red to a lighter orange near the sun, free from visible banding. The colors flow naturally, creating an atmospheric scene without harsh lines or unnatural color boundaries.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the grass textures in the foreground appear naturally lit and spatially coherent with the rest of the scene, without repeating patterns or artificial sharpness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass at the foreground is carefully examined for its lighting and texture. The grass shows consistent lighting that ties well with the overall sunset theme, providing a natural gradient of shadows and highlights. There are no visible repeating patterns or signs of artificial sharpness, suggesting that the grass textures are coherent with the rest of the scene.",

      "question": "Are the angular acacia tree silhouettes structurally plausible and visually balanced within the composition, without broken branches or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the acacia tree silhouettes are observed for their form and composition. The trees maintain their characteristic flat-topped structure, and their placement is visually balanced across the image. No broken branches or unnatural angles are visible, lending the image a realistic and aesthetically pleasing composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title text positioned above the lion without overlapping its head or body, and does it maintain legible contrast without introducing visual noise or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title text 'KING OF THE WILD' is analyzed for its placement and legibility against the backdrop. The text is positioned prominently above the lion, not overlapping its head or body, ensuring clear visibility of the animal. The contrast between the white text and the darker background ensures high legibility, and there are no signs of visual noise or distortion affecting the text.",
