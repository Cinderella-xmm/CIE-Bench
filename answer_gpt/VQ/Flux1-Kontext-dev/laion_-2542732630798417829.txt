    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes and smile drawn on the glass surface without causing visible distortion or blocking of the internal filament structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and smile are designed to be part of the cartoonish representation of the bulb character. This involves adding facial features on the glass surface. Despite these additions, the internal filament, which represents the light source, remains clearly visible and is not distorted or blocked by the eyes or smile. The drawing is done in a manner that respects the transparency and integrity of the glass surface, allowing viewers to see the filament distinctly.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the arms extend from the bulb body in a way that follows the curvature of the glass and metal cage without appearing detached or geometrically broken?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon-like arms are drawn coming out of the bulb character in a fashion that stylistically conforms to the curvature of the bulb and the surrounding metal cage. The arms are integrated into the design seamlessly, maintaining a fluidity and adherence to the bulb’s shape without breaking geometric continuity, thus appearing naturally as part of the character's body.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the metal cage fully intact with all loops connected and symmetrically arranged around the bulb, showing no missing or distorted sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the metal cage surrounding the bulb has been depicted intact and consistent with the original design of the cage shown in Image A. The loops appear thoroughly connected and symmetrically arranged, maintaining the original structural integrity and aesthetic symmetry around the bulb without any missing or distorted parts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the background elements cast shadows and reflect light in a manner consistent with the direction and intensity of the bulb’s glow?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartooning adds dynamic lighting effects to the background elements, consistent with the bulb's position and glow intensity. The background shadows and highlighted areas are crafted to suggest illumination effects coming from the bulb, mimicking real-world lighting reflexively. These artistic choices help to maintain an visual consistency that makes the bulb appear more like a light source.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the colors applied evenly across all surfaces (glass, metal, background) without visible banding, oversaturation, or texture degradation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, colors are applied in a stylized comic-book fashion that results in vibrant, yet controlled tones. While they are bold, the colors appear evenly applied across various elements, including the glass, metal cage, and the background, without noticeable issues like banding or texture degradation. Coloring choices enhance the graphical style without causing oversaturation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the text box and speech bubble positioned so that they do not overlap with the bulb’s internal structure or metal cage, and are they clearly readable?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows speech bubbles positioned in an area that avoids overlapping with the bulb's internal structure or metal cage, ensuring clarity and readability. The placement allows the text content to be comprehensively viewed without interference, maintaining communication efficacy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the arms positioned in a way that follows natural joint angles and does not intersect with the bulb’s glass or metal cage in an impossible manner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon-like arms are drawn extending naturally from the bulb with joint angles that maintain a credible visual aesthetic within the animated context. They do not intersect with the bulb's or cage's surfaces in a manner that appears geometrically impossible, supporting the whimsical yet coherent arm positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
