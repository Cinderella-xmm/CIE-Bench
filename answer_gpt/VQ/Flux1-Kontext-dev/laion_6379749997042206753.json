      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the kernel wearing autumn attire maintain consistent size and texture with real corn kernels, and does the clothing appear seamlessly integrated without visible edges or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kernel is depicted wearing autumn-themed attire. To assess if it maintains a consistent size and texture with real corn kernels, I observe the relative scale and visual appearance compared to known dimensions of corn kernels. The attire appears cartoonish and part of the character design, so it is unlikely intended to match real kernel textures. No visible edges or mismatched textures are noticed in the integration of attire, implying a seamless design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the energy lines emanating from the popcorn pieces smooth and consistent with the direction of motion, and do they avoid intersecting or distorting the popcorn shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The energy lines in Image B are designed to suggest motion and vitality around the popcorn pieces. These lines are drawn in an animated style consistent with the dynamic action theme, maintaining smooth and aligned flow along the motion direction. They do not intersect with or distort the popcorn shapes, maintaining clarity and intended visual aesthetics.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the popcorn piece with the explorer hat properly scaled and textured, and do the spices and pumpkin elements adjacent to it appear naturally positioned without overlapping distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The popcorn piece wearing an explorer hat appears well-integrated within the scene in terms of scale and texture, fitting the cartoonish style of the artwork. Adjacent elements like spices and pumpkins are positioned to complement this central figure without visible overlapping or distortions, maintaining coherence in the layout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the popcorn pieces entering the ceramic bowls follow a downward trajectory consistent with gravity, and do they remain within the bowl boundaries without appearing to float above or clip through the rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, popcorn pieces are illustrated entering bowls with an animated touch but still adhere to a logical path downwards. They settle within the bowls naturally and do not float above or breach the rim's boundaries. This gives a sense of gravity despite the exaggerated art style, reflecting attention to spatial cues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the added elements (such as hats, energy lines, and spices) consistent with the original orange-brown theme, and do they lack over-saturation or color bleeding at edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added elements, including hats and energy lines, in Image B maintain vibrant yet consistent hues with the warm orange-brown theme in keeping with the autumn motif. The colors are applied without over-saturation, and there is no evidence of color bleeding at the edges, preserving the clarity and aesthetics of the illustration.",
