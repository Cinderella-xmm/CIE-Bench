      "question": "Are the textures of the owl’s feathers and the tree bark rendered with realistic detail and variation, without unnatural repetition or synthetic-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's feathers and the tree bark appear to have realistic texture, reflecting detailed patterns and variations typical of natural elements. The shading and highlights on the feathers suggest depth and volume, similar to real owl plumage, while the bark has intricate, irregular patterns characteristic of natural wood. There are no visible signs of synthetic repetition, and both elements maintain a lifelike appearance. Comparison with Image A shows consistency in this natural rendering style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the moon depicted as a circular dotted diagram with evenly spaced dots and clear, legible labels indicating lunar phases, without jagged edges or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the moon with a circular dotted diagram around it, intended to represent lunar phases. However, the dots are not perfectly even or uniformly spaced, and the labels are not clear or aligned properly, as they appear to be distorted, using an inconsistent font style which affects legibility. Unlike standard scientific diagrams, these elements display warping, which doesn't provide precise lunar phase information. Image A presents the moon without such diagrammatic elements, serving as a backdrop rather than an educational tool.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the labels pointing to the owl’s talons and feathers placed without overlapping vital features, and do they use consistent line styles and text formatting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, labels point towards various parts of the image, such as the owl's talons and feathers. While some labels do not overlap vital features, the overall placement is awkward with some lines cutting across significant visual elements. The text formatting is inconsistent, featuring varied fonts and alignment issues, leading to a lack of visual harmony. In Image A, these labels and lines are absent, maintaining the integrity of visual elements without interference.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text box located at the bottom of the image, sized appropriately, and styled with earthy tones and readable typography that matches the botanical illustration theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text box in Image B is positioned at the image's bottom, but its size is quite large, covering part of the tree. The style incorporates earthy tones that might fit a natural theme, yet the typography fails in readability due to distorted characters and jumbled composition. The text lacks coherent formatting which contradicts a botanical illustration's aesthetic harmony. Image A presents no such text box, emphasizing its visual narrative without text interruption.",

      "question": "Does the owl sit naturally on the tree branch with correct posture and claw positioning, and is the tree trunk and branch structure continuous and anatomically plausible without breaks or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's posture appears natural with its claws correctly gripping the tree branch, indicating plausible interaction with the setting. The continuity and anatomical accuracy of the tree trunk and branches are maintained without visual distortions, breaks, or warping, mimicking realistic tree forms. Compared to Image A, the owl’s position and tree structure remain consistent and properly depicted.",
