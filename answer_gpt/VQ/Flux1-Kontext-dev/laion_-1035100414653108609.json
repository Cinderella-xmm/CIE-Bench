    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the moss textures on the tusks follow the curvature of the tusks and cast consistent shadows matching the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tusks are depicted with a smooth and curved texture that appears consistent with a natural tusk shape. The moss-like textures on the tusks follow the natural curvature and the overall appearance is consistent, suggesting a coherent integration. Additionally, considering the direction of the light in the scene, the shadows and highlights on the tusks appear consistent with this lighting. This consistency in textures, curvature, and shadows especially aligns with natural lighting principles.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the waterfall-like mane flow continuously from the top of the head downward without intersecting or distorting the snout or ear regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mane seems to be designed to mimic the appearance of waterfall-like flowing hair. It appears to be smoothly transitioning from the top of the head down along the back and does not visually intersect or distort the areas around the snout or ears. The strands are well-defined and maintain a clear division without overlapping key facial features",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the leaf-styled patterns aligned with the natural folds and contours of the warthog’s body, avoiding abrupt edges or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaf-styled patterns on Image B appear to be thoughtfully placed to align with the natural contours and shape of the warthog’s body. There are no abrupt edges or misalignments; instead, the patterns flow smoothly over the body's surface. This alignment with the natural body contours preserves the overall organic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fungi positioned along the spine and upper back without overlapping legs or protruding unnaturally into the air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, there is no visible presence of fungi-like elements protruding unnaturally or in a discordant manner. The attention is more centered on the leafy and natural textures without visible fungi elements that disrupt the leg alignment or protrude unusually.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing eyes remain within the eye sockets, preserving the shape of the eyelids and surrounding facial features without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are depicted with a glowing effect but are appropriately positioned within the eye sockets. The surrounding facial structures, including eyelids, appear intact and undistorted. The glowing effect does not impact the structural integrity or alignment of the eyes with surrounding features.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the branch-shaped hooves connect naturally to the lower legs and maintain consistent joint alignment without breaking the leg structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hooves in Image B are stylized to resemble branches and are naturally connected to the lower legs. This connection maintains the leg structure's continuity and alignment. These branch-shaped hooves are coherent with the overall design and anatomical positioning, ensuring the integrity of the leg structure is preserved.",
