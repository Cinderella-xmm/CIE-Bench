    "Question": "Q1: Do the hippo and rabbit maintain their natural proportions and structural consistency in the 3D cartoon design without any visible distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D cartoon design features a hippo and a rabbit in a stylized manner. The hippo retains its recognizable large form, while the rabbit holds a petite and upright posture. Cartoon designs often exaggerate or simplify real-world proportions for artistic effect, so while the hippo and rabbit in Image B maintain a sense of consistency within their cartoon context, they naturally deviate from realistic proportions. Thus, the proportions are consistent within a cartoon framework without visible distortions common for their design style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the gentle lighting and cozy tones in the 3D design enhance the natural appearance of the hippo and rabbit without creating any unnatural highlights or shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is soft, and the colors are warm, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. This style is typical for cartoon designs to emphasize cuteness and friendly appearance. The lighting does not introduce harsh or unnatural highlights and shadows that would make the characters look unrealistic or visually unpleasant.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the fine details of the hippo's skin texture and the rabbit's fur preserved in the 3D design without any loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The 3D cartoon design in Image B adopts a simplified and stylized approach typical of cartoon aesthetics. Therefore, compared to realistic imagery, detailed textures such as the specific skin texture of the hippo and the minute fur details of the rabbit are not present. Instead, the characters are smoother, lacking detailed texture by design. This absence of detail is characteristic of the chosen design style, rather than any loss or flaw.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the placement of the title banner and nameplate integrate seamlessly with the 3D design of the hippo and rabbit, maintaining visual credibility and not disrupting the harmony between the characters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the title banner and nameplate are placed at the top and bottom parts of the card-like design, away from the hippo and rabbit's central positioning. The title and text elements complement the visual design by fitting within the typical layout of a trading card or sticker, ensuring they do not overwhelm or clash with the character depictions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the nature-inspired backdrop with earthy greens and rich tones blend naturally with the 3D design of the hippo and rabbit, avoiding any visual inconsistencies or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "The backdrop in Image B features a stylized nature-inspired setting with soft, earthy tones and simplified shapes representing foliage. This cartoon-like backdrop is consistent with the overall character design, maintaining a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing composition without any jarring contrasts or unnatural elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
