      "question": "Does the elongated body retain smooth, continuous curvature along the side and rear panels without sharp edges or unnatural bulges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vehicle showcases a streamlined form typical of high-end design. The body appears to have a smooth progression from the front to the rear, achieving a seamless look that suggests sophistication and aerodynamics commonly found in luxury vehicles or conceptual designs. There are no abrupt or jagged transitions noticeable, supporting the idea of continuity in design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glass bases at the wheel positions transparent with visible internal texture, evenly shaped, and grounded flush with the platform without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bases at the wheel positions resemble glass in color and texture, presenting a transparent appearance where one might expect wheels. These bases appear to have detail, suggesting internal texture. They are uniformly positioned enhancing the stability and aesthetic of the vehicle's presentation, grounded on the platform consistently without visible errors or discrepancies such as floating.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the silver cap centered on the roof area, with clean edges and reflective surface that matches the surrounding chrome elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silver cap atop the roof in Image B is distinctly visible and appears centrally positioned, contributing to the symmetrical aesthetics. Its edges seem refined and clean, which aligns with the overall high-quality chrome finishes around the vehicle. This gives the vehicle a cohesive look with thematic reflective surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the embossed text along the side panel clearly legible, aligned with the body's curvature, and rendered with subtle depth and shadow to match the material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text on the side panel of Image B is bestowed with embossing techniques that ensure clarity and legibility. It follows the bodyâ€™s mild curvature, upholding the continuity of design without distortion. The depth and shadow are subtle yet effective, playing off the metallic material which allows the text to stand out adequately without unnecessary contrast.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wave patterns flow continuously across the surface without repeating tiles, jagged edges, or mismatched lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, wave-like patterns embellish the body sides, exhibiting fluidity that flows naturally along the design path. The waves appear smooth and organically integrated without visible repetitions or artificial interruptions suggesting tiling errors or lighting mismatches.",
