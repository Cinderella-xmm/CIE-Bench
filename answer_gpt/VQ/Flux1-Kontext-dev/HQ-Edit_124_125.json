    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the figure's raised leg and upper arm maintain continuous, smooth curvature without sharp breaks or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's raised leg exhibits a smooth and continuous curvature from the standing foot to the hand holding the raised foot. The upper arm also follows a natural, flowing line without any breaks or sudden angles, demonstrating consistency with how a human body can stretch in such a pose.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the figure's clothing and the surrounding environment (sky, sand, water) unified in tone, with no abrupt shifts or clashing hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing of the figure, as well as the colors of the sky, sand, and water, are subtly matched. They all share similar tonal qualities, suggesting a sunset or sunrise lighting scenario. The colors blend harmoniously without any jarringly abrupt shifts, creating a cohesive visual experience.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the angle between the neck and torso consistent with human flexibility, and do the extended arms show smooth, uninterrupted lines without kinks or bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the neck and torso at an angle that is consistent with a flexible yoga pose. The arms, particularly those extended above and behind the head, are smooth and naturally curved without any unnatural kinks or abrupt bends, mimicking a typical yoga position harmoniously.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the textures on the figure’s skin and clothing show consistent shading and fine detail without visible pixelation or smeared regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skin and clothing of the figure display consistent shading, with gradients reflecting the light source accurately and smoothly. The details are depicted with clarity, and there is no noticeable pixelation or blurring, providing a polished and detailed appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the foot have exactly five fingers, each with natural curvature and proper contact with the foot, without overlapping or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B reveals the hand holding the foot has precisely five fingers. Each finger is positioned naturally and makes contact with the foot without overlapping awkwardly or missing digits, which aligns with the expected anatomy of a hand.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the shadow beneath the figure aligned with the sun’s position in the sky and does it taper naturally toward the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadow cast on the sand aligns correctly with the sun's position, being elongated and directed towards the horizon. The tapering effect is subtle and realistic, representative of a low-sun angle during sunrise or sunset, adhering to natural shadow behavior.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible halos, jagged edges, or blending errors along the outline of the figure, particularly around the raised leg and arm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outline of the figure, including the areas around the raised leg and arm, is clean and precise. There are no visible halos, jagged edges, or blending errors, which suggests a smooth and well-integrated rendering of the figure within the compositional process.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
