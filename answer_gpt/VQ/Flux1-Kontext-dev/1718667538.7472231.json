      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the tiger’s face cleanly defined with uniform thickness and no pixelated or broken lines indicating poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger's face is depicted as a stylized graphic image with bold black outlines, which are clean and of uniform thickness. The lines are consistent and there are no visible pixelated or broken lines, indicating a high-quality rendering typical of vector graphics or carefully designed illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the exaggerated stripes and enlarged whiskers remain symmetrically aligned and proportionally consistent with the rest of the tiger’s facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes and whiskers on the graphic representation of the tiger’s face are symmetrically distributed and maintain proportionality with the rest of the facial features. The design appears balanced on both sides of the face, and the lines enhance the stylization of the tiger’s features without compromising symmetry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the kimono panels clearly separated into distinct layers with clean edges and no overlapping or floating segments that suggest improper layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono panels are depicted in a simplified, stylized manner as part of the graphic imagery. The lines create distinct edges for each panel. There is clarity and separation between the layers, and there are no signs of improper layering such as overlap or floating segments. This is consistent with traditional artistic depictions where each element is distinctly outlined.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the gold foil elements exhibit consistent reflectivity and blend naturally with the surrounding floral pattern without harsh highlights or floating fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of gold foil elements is an artistic technique that is often used in printed work to provide a reflective quality. The consistency of the gold foil effect is seen where the elements blend harmoniously into the illustrated floral pattern without creating unnatural highlights or appearing as disjointed fragments. The metallic effect is designed to appear integrated with the surrounding pattern.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the detachable panels aligned with natural fold lines or garment seams and do they appear securely attached without floating or intersecting incorrectly with adjacent clothing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the graphic representation of the kimono includes panels that align with traditional garment seams. The artwork is stylized to depict a structured garment without showing any signs of floating or misalignment. The visual composition suggests a careful adherence to real-world garment construction, with intentional artistic simplification.",
