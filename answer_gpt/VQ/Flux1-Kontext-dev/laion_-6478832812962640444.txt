    "Question": "Q1: Do the areas previously featuring stitched embroidery (on the shaft and vamp) now display consistent metallic inlay textures with no visible seams, texture breaks, or mismatched gloss levels?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boot exhibits metallic inlay textures across the shaft and vamp. These metallic areas have a continuous and uniform appearance, with no visible seams or texture breaks. The gloss level appears consistent across the entire surface, indicating a cohesive material transition. This is supported by the lack of visible inconsistencies that would suggest mismatched gloss or seams.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the newly designed stepped heel structurally aligned with the sole and boot shaft, with clean geometric edges and no floating or misaligned segments?",
    "explanation": "The heel in Image B is designed with a stepped geometric structure that aligns well with the sole and boot shaft. It has clean, defined edges that match the rest of the boot's design. There is no indication of any misalignment or segments that appear to be floating, suggesting that the structural integrity of the heel is maintained. This conclusion is based on the sharpness of the heel’s design and its alignment with the boot’s geometric structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the transformed patterns along the shaft and toe area composed of sharp, consistent geometric lines without distorting the boot's outline or causing unnatural swelling or compression?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the shaft and toe area are composed of intricate geometric lines that are consistently sharp. These lines are well-defined and do not distort the boot’s overall outline, preserving its natural shape without any signs of swelling or compression. This can be concluded from the uniformity of the pattern and its seamless integration with the boot's structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the metallic inlays exhibit uniform specular highlights without bright spots, halos, or uneven reflections that suggest digital noise or over-processing?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, the metallic inlays across the boot show uniform specular highlights. The reflection is consistent, with no bright spots or halos that would suggest uneven processing or digital noise. The specularity seems natural and evenly distributed, corroborating the absence of over-processing artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the boot maintain a natural foot-shaped profile with properly proportioned toe box, ankle, and shaft height, without unnatural elongation, compression, or asymmetry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boot maintains a natural foot-shaped profile, including a well-proportioned toe box, ankle area, and shaft height. The proportions appear normal, without any indication of elongation, compression, or asymmetry, thus preserving the boot’s functionality and aesthetic. This assessment is based on the balanced shapes and sizes relative to traditional boot designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
