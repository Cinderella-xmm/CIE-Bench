    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the converted jug appear as a translucent glass stopper with visible reflections and refractions, and is it properly aligned with the bottle’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object on top of the bottle does appear as a translucent glass stopper. It exhibits characteristics typical of glass, such as reflections and refractions, enhancing its translucent appearance. The alignment with the bottle’s neck is proper, as it fits snugly without seeming disproportionate or misaligned. These visual cues correspond with what is expected of a glass stopper, thus confirming that the transformation is consistent with the question.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the robe seamlessly transformed into a bottle shape with smooth contours, natural lighting gradients, and no visible tears or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle shows a smooth and seamless transformation from the robe's contour. The lighting across the surface enhances a natural gradient effect, typical of rounded surfaces under lighting, without any visible tears or distortions. This reflects an appropriate transformation of the robe into a bottle shape, adhering to the laws of light and shadow on such surfaces.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the goose-shaped charm integrated into the base of the bottle with a visible connection point, and does it maintain proportional size and stylized but recognizable features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there isn't a clear indication of a goose-shaped charm integrated into the base of the bottle. Instead, what appears is a separate grape charm hanging on the bottle. The expected features and connection integration of a goose charm are not present in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the grapevine engravings clearly defined, following the bottle’s contour, and free from jagged edges or inconsistent line thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grapevine engravings are detailed and follow the bottle’s contours with precision. The lines are consistent in thickness and curvature, free from any jagged edges. This detailed design captures the elegance and precision expected from such engravings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cardboard packaging fully enclosed around the bottle with clean edges, subtle shadows, and clear classical motifs without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardboard packaging is designed with classical motifs that are sharp and clear. The box appears to be fully enclosed without misalignments. The edges are clean, and the motifs are distinct, indicating high-quality design work. Subtle shadows around the box enhance the 3D effect and enclose the bottle properly, corresponding with expectations for detailed packaging.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the earthy tones and gold accents uniformly applied across all surfaces, with appropriate material-specific highlights and no abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the earthy tones and gold accents are applied uniformly across the bottle surface. The highlights on the bottle reflect appropriate interaction with light, mimicking material-specific reflections seen in glossy and metallic surfaces. There are no abrupt color shifts that would detract from the cohesive visual theme, making the color application consistent and harmonious.",
