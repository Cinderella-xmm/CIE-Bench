      "question": "Does the glass dome enclosing the pocket watch and fabric exhibit clear, smooth transparency with realistic light refraction and reflection, without visible distortion or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears smooth and clear, showing realistic transparency by accurately reflecting and refracting light. The surface of the dome is well-rendered, allowing visibility of the objects inside without distortion or jagged edges, which suggests that the dome's modeling and rendering are done proficiently, maintaining its integrity.",
