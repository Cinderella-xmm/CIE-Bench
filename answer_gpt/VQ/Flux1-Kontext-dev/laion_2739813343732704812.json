      "question": "Is the pelican's beak elongated but still attached naturally to the head without bending or breaking at the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's beak is indeed elongated, which is a common feature of pelicans for catching fish. It appears properly attached to the head without any unnatural bends or breaks, demonstrating a natural connection at the base. The consistency in structure suggests that the beak maintains a realistic attachment despite the illustration style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the pelican’s feathers display visible layered texture despite being colored in pastel shades, without appearing uniformly smooth or pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's feathers are colored in pastel blue, with visible strokes and outlines that mimic the layered texture of real feathers. These textures indicate a stylized representation rather than a pixelated or perfectly smooth surface. The artist has included these details to maintain a sense of feather-like layering even in a cartoon style.",

      "question": "Is the sailor hat positioned securely on the pelican’s head without overlapping the neck or appearing detached from the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a sailor hat placed on the pelican's head, and it is positioned accurately without encroaching onto the neck area or appearing lifted or detached. The hat is styled to fit on the rounded top of the pelican's head, demonstrating that it is securely in place.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wooden plank background extend evenly behind the pelican without visible seams or inconsistencies in wood grain or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a wooden plank design that appears consistent behind the pelican. The wood texture and grain continue evenly across the image without noticeable seams or changes in lighting that could disrupt the continuity of the background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pelican’s legs and feet proportionally aligned with the body and not distorted or bent in an unnatural way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's legs and feet are aligned proportionally with the rest of the body. The legs appear straight and naturally extend from the body, and the feet maintain a structured and balanced position, consistent with how a pelican would stand. There are no signs of distortion or unnatural bending.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the pelican appear as a flat, two-dimensional object with minimal depth cues and clean edges, consistent with a magnet design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the pelican with a cartoonish and flat appearance, which is typical for a magnet design. The use of bold outlines, solid colors, and a lack of shading give the pelican a two-dimensional look. The edges are cleanly drawn, reinforcing the minimal depth perception often found in magnet-style artwork.",
