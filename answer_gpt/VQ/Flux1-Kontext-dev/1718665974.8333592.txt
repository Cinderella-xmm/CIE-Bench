    "Question": "Q1: Do the brass gears and leather armor pieces on the character’s torso and limbs have consistent shapes, realistic metallic textures, and proper alignment without visible gaps or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brass gears and leather armor pieces exhibit consistent shapes and realistic metallic textures, indicating a high level of detail in the artwork. The alignment appears proper, with no visible gaps or misaligned edges, which suggests the elements were designed to fit together seamlessly, indicating the artist's attention to craftsmanship and detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the clockwork wings symmetrically positioned and structurally coherent, with visible mechanical joints and gear patterns that follow logical engineering principles and do not exhibit warped or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "The clockwork wings in Image B are symmetrically positioned on either side of the character. The mechanical joints and gear patterns exhibit a design consistent with logical engineering principles, reflecting a coherent structure. The symmetrical and intentional design of the wings and their components prevents any visible warping or broken geometry, ensuring a balanced and realistic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the clock face integrated into the glowing orb clearly visible, properly scaled, and emitting light consistently with the surrounding glow, without distorting the shape or texture of the orb or tendrils?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face integrated into the glowing orb is not present as the clock is placed separately on the character's chest, unlike in Image A. Thus, there is no distortion to consider, as the shape and texture of the orb remain unchanged with no integration of timepieces into them.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the background cityscape feature detailed brass towers and airships arranged in a spatially plausible layout, with consistent lighting and shadowing under a sepia tone, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background cityscape showcases detailed brass towers and airships. These elements are arranged in a spatially plausible layout, maintaining a consistent perspective. The sepia tone is applied uniformly, enhancing the cohesion between different elements and the shadows are consistent with the light source, ensuring that nothing appears to be floating or disconnected.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sepia tone applied consistently across the entire image, maintaining visible details in the character’s clothing, mechanical elements, and background without causing fading, discoloration, or loss of contrast in critical areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sepia tone is applied evenly, preserving the details within the character’s clothing, mechanical elements, and background cityscape. The image retains clarity and contrast, ensuring that essential details remain visible and vibrant without any fading or discoloration, which shows deliberate application to maintain visual appeal and coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
