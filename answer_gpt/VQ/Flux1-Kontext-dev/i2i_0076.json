      "question": "Does the word \"warm\" blend seamlessly into the top left corner without disrupting the natural appearance and introducing any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'warm' is added in the top left corner with a bold, white font against an orange background. The word itself covers part of the sky above the mountains in the painting. Since 'warm' is part of the edited image text overlay, it does not attempt to naturally blend into the natural landscape of the painting. Its purpose is to stand out as a header, and its appearance is distinctly artificial compared to the natural scenery depicted in the artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the addition of the word \"warm\" at the top left corner maintained the structural consistency of surrounding elements like the sofa and cushions, avoiding any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": " Image B solely incorporates the word 'warm' in the context of a themed presentation, completely separate from any elements like the sofa or cushions seen in Image A. In the edited image, the addition of 'warm' does not interact with or cause distortion to any physical elements such as the sofa or cushions as it is only added to the separate artwork. Therefore, there is no effect on structural consistency as those elements are not part of Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the size and font of the word \"warm\" maintain visual plausibility and authentic integration with the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'warm' is styled in bold, white font and distinctly contrasts against the orange background. The presentation of this text is intentional and stylistically designed to stand out from the background art as part of a graphical overlay, which means it does not aim for integration with the artistic natural landscape behind it but rather serves as a thematic title for Image B. This makes the presentation plausible in the context of the edited image's intention.",

      "question": "Is the word \"freedom\" at the bottom right corner added in a manner that preserves the fine details of the floor and plant, avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'freedom' is added at the bottom right corner of the artwork, not affecting any floor or plant details as it represents a graphical overlay separate from elements present in Image A. Therefore, it doesn't interact with or disturb details like flooring or plant seen in original image context.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement of the word \"freedom\" at the bottom right corner respect the structural integrity of nearby elements, such as the corner of the rug and plant pot base, without causing any visible distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of 'freedom' in Image B is purely stylistic relative to the artwork's edited format and does not touch any elements like the rug or plant pot base, which are visible in Image A. As Image B is a separate production focused solely on a thematic presentation, it does not cause distortion in the integrity of elements like shown in Image A.",
