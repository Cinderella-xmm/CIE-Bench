      "question": "Does the cat maintain its structural coherence and natural texture, without showing any unnatural artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a cat, there is a horse in the foreground, which appears to be in structurally coherent form and natural texture. Upon visual inspection, the horse lacks any indications of distortion or unnatural artifacts, suggesting that this element of the image is well-edited and convincingly realistic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B depicts a ruined city scene, which is consistently matched with the foreground image of a horse; there are no obvious breaks, inconsistencies, or indications of poorly executed editing. The foreground and the background are well-meshed in the image, suggesting seamless integration.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the text “LAST RIDE” appear natural and appropriately styled, without introducing any distracting elements that could detract from the image's overall harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'LAST RIDE' is prominently placed at the top of Image B. It has a bold, clear styling that suits the thematic coherence of the image without being overly distracting. The style and placement contribute effectively to the overall thematic intent of the image, maintaining its harmony.",

      "question": "Has the cool-tone filter been applied evenly across the image, preserving the clarity and fine details of both the cat and the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no filter evident that has been applied evenly across the image, as it features a horse rather than a cat, and the cool-tone is not constant throughout the image. The focus was on integrating thematic elements rather than applying specific filters.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the film rating label fit naturally within the composition of the image, complementing rather than disrupting the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The film rating label in Image B is located in the lower-left corner and appears to be seamlessly integrated into the image's composition. Its placement and design do not disrupt the visual flow of the image and complement the overall theme, making it a naturally fitting element.",
