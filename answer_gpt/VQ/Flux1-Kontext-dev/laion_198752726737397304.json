      "question": "Do the superhero costumes on all five individuals have consistent fabric textures and realistic draping that follow the contours of their bodies without unnatural stretching or folding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the superhero costumes appear designed in a comic-book style, which often emphasizes bold colors, graphical prints, and simplified textures. The costumes display vibrant flower and pattern designs, specifically with daffodil motifs. These elements are typical of cartoon illustrations where the focus is not on realistic textile representation but on stylized visual aesthetics. As a result, the fabric textures lack realistic draping and instead follow the animated style. Therefore, the costumes do not exhibit consistent fabric textures or realistic draping that would be expected in a real-life setting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the hands holding the Daffodil Power Passes positioned naturally with five fingers visible per hand, appropriate grip pressure, and no signs of clipping or floating objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands holding the Daffodil Power Passes are drawn in a comic style, which might not focus on realistic portrayal of grip and finger visibility. The illustrations may lack details such as individual finger articulation, leading to less natural hand positioning. Some fingers may be omitted or inaccurately rendered, common in stylized drawings. Therefore, the portrayal of hands in this image may not align with natural grip and finger visibility.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the poses of the five individuals physically plausible, with joints aligned naturally and no bent limbs or disproportionate body segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The poses in Image B are consistent with comic artwork, where stylization often takes precedence over anatomical accuracy. Such art styles might feature exaggerated proportions or poses for effect, making them potentially physically implausible when judged by realistic standards. Therefore, it is likely that the poses may not align naturally with real-world anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dialogue bubbles positioned above or near the heads of the individuals without overlapping eyes or mouths, and do they display legible text with clean edges and no visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dialogue bubbles are strategically placed above or near the individualsâ€™ heads, adhering to comic layout norms that ensure clarity. The text, although stylized to fit the theme (such as using a playful font or distorted text), maintains a clear appearance. The positioning prevents overlap with facial features like eyes or mouths, ensuring readability. This layout reflects an intentional and clean design without visual artifacts.",

      "question": "Is the enhanced garden background visually coherent with the original scene, featuring consistent lighting, natural flower arrangements, and no abrupt color shifts or artificial-looking textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The garden background in Image B retains elements of the original scene but adapts them to fit the comic style. Although the lighting and colors are adjusted to match the vibrant theme, there are no abrupt shifts or overly artificial textures noticeable. The flower arrangements maintain a similar layout, though the adaptation into a comic form naturally simplifies textures and colors for stylistic consistency. Therefore, the enhanced background still appears visually coherent.",
