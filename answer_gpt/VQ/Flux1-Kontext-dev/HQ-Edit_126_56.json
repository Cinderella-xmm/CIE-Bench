      "question": "Are the mountain shapes simplified into clear geometric forms without distorted edges or irregular facets that break their structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are depicted with sharp and geometric edges that create a consistent triangular structure. This geometry reinforces a simplified view without distorted edges or irregular facets, providing a striking and clear form. The lines defining the mountain shapes are straight and angular, commonly associated with geometric design principles, indicating an intentional choice to maintain structural consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the trees retain recognizable silhouettes with consistent geometric proportions and smooth outlines, avoiding fragmented or misshapen branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are illustrated with bold, clear outlines, and their individual silhouettes maintain consistent geometric proportions. The use of vivid colors highlights the foliage without distracting from the overall shapes. The branches and leaf clusters appear intact and harmoniously aligned, with no indication of fragmentation or distortion. This treatment aligns with the intended aesthetic of geometry and smoothness.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the radiating parallel lines in the river aligned with its natural flow direction and spaced uniformly to maintain visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lines within the river are designed to mirror the flow direction, maintaining parallel alignment from the foreground towards the background. They are spaced at intervals that appear deliberately uniform, contributing to a sense of movement and continuity within the water's surface. This alignment is accentuated by the overall design and geometric consistency throughout the image.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the reflection in the river perfectly symmetrical to the elements above it, with matching shapes and positions of trees and mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection within the river is made to perfectly match the elements above it, including the trees and mountains. Each feature reflected in the water shares an identical shape and position with its real counterpart, echoing symmetry and enhancing the visual harmony. The reflection accurately follows the geometric proportions and layout visible above.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the color block boundaries crisp and clean, with no visible blurring, feathering, or pixelation at the edges of geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases color blocks with defined, sharp edges that delineate different areas and objects without visible blurring or feathering. The transitions between colors are clean, emphasizing the contrast and maintaining the integrity of geometric shapes throughout the image. This presentation exemplifies a high level of precision in the color application, conducive to the vibrant and geometric aesthetic.",
