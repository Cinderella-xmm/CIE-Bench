    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs free from unnatural textures and maintain detailed edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal silhouettes appear to be well-defined, maintaining the integrity of the couple's forms. The contours of the figures are clear and sharp, indicating attention to maintaining detailed edges. The textures are consistent with crystal-like surfaces, suggesting a polished and smooth appearance without unnatural distortions. Based on these observations, the silhouettes do not show signs of poor texture mapping or lack of edge detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs integrate naturally with the background and the bench, without creating visible breaks or distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal silhouettes blend seamlessly with the environment, where the bench and the couple's positioning remain aligned. There are no visible gaps or awkward transitions between the silhouettes, the bench, or the background. The visual flow remains intact, suggesting a well-integrated scene without noticeable disruptions or disjointed elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the proportions and shapes of the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs realistic and consistent with human anatomy, avoiding exaggerated or distorted forms?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining the crystal silhouettes in Image B, the shapes and proportions appear to match realistic human anatomy. The curvature of the backs, the positioning of the heads, and the overall structure mirror human forms without displaying any exaggerated features or distorted anatomical aspects. This suggests that the transformation into crystal silhouettes did not compromise the realism of the figures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the crystal material used for the silhouettes of the couple's backs appear three-dimensional and transparent, contributing to the overall natural appearance?",
    "explanation": "The crystal material in Image B gives a convincing three-dimensional appearance; reflections and light refractions are consistent with a crystal-like texture, offering depth. The material demonstrates a certain level of transparency, allowing some interaction with the surrounding light and colors, which aids in creating a realistic and natural impression rather than a flat overlay.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs still convey the impression that the couple is seated naturally on the bench, maintaining spatial coherence?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the crystal silhouettes corresponds well with the bench, maintaining the expected seating posture. The angles of the backs and the alignment with the sitting surface and legs give the impression of a natural sitting position, preserving spatial coherence without appearing as though the figures are floating or improperly positioned.",
    "answer": "Yes"
