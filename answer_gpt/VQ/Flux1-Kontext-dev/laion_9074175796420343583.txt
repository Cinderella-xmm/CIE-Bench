    "Question": "Q1: Are the arms and face drawn on the pie’s surface consistent with the texture and color of the crust, without visible digital artifacts or mismatched shading?",
    "explanation": "By examining Image B, the pie’s surface shows a face and arms that blend well with the crust's color and texture, suggesting a consistent integration. There are no apparent digital artifacts disrupting the crust’s visual texture and shading. The artist has skillfully matched the pie’s characteristics, maintaining a coherent appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the lattice pattern retain its original grid structure and spacing, and does it appear as a draped fabric apron without broken or stretched lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lattice pattern is absent, replaced by a pie without the defining grid structure of the lattice or any apron-like features. The pie’s surface is more characteristic of a uniform crust rather than the lattice seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the knife converted into a feather pen with a realistic quill tip and wooden shaft, and does it maintain a natural transition from the original knife shape without abrupt edges or texture mismatches?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the knife as a feather pen, with a quill tip and wooden shaft. The transformation is smoothly integrated into the artwork, the feather seamlessly replaces the knife, maintaining coherence in the object’s shape and texture without abrupt transitions or mismatches, indicating thoughtful editing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the additional pastries positioned at a consistent distance and scale relative to the main pie, and do they cast realistic shadows and reflect the same lighting direction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the additional pastries surrounding the character and the pie appear to maintain consistent proportions and distances. They do not cast distinguishable shadows due to the stylized nature of the art but adhere to the lighting direction under the stylized representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the text bubbles positioned close to the pie’s mouth, legible, and free from overlapping or clipping with the pie or plate?",
    "explanation": "The text bubbles in Image B are positioned above the pie, clear and legible, without overlapping or clipping with the pie or plate. The bubbles are spatially consistent regarding text communication, adhering to the visual narrative without obstruction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the hands on the pie have exactly five fingers each, proper joint alignment, and a natural grip on the feather pen without deformation or extra digits?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts hands on the pie that seem anatomically incorrect; they do not have discernible fingers as normally seen in a hand and lack a proper grip or alignment that would suggest realism. The stylized artwork does not adhere to natural hand structure.",
    "answer": "No"
