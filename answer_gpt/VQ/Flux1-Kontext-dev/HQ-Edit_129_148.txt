    "Question": "Q1: Is the figure proportionally scaled and positioned within the globe such that her body parts (especially limbs and head) maintain natural anatomical alignment and do not appear stretched or compressed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure appears proportional, with limbs and body parts aligned in a natural way. The dress fits well, and there is no visible distortion in the figure's positioning within the globe. Based on the visual cues and general knowledge of human proportions, the figure does not seem to be stretched or compressed compared to what is expected in reality.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the intricate patterns on the dress and the braided hairstyle clearly visible and free from blurring, aliasing, or loss of fine detail after conversion to a 3D model?",
    "explanation": "The patterns on the dress and the braided hairstyle are distinct and clear in Image B. The colors and shapes are well-defined without signs of blurring or aliasing. Such clarity suggests that fine details have been preserved in the conversion to a 3D model.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the wall patterns inside the globe accurately reflect the colors and shapes of the dress's pattern without warping, misalignment, or color deviation?",
    "explanation": "The wall patterns inside the globe complement the dress's pattern, showing consistent colors and shapes. There is no evident warping, misalignment, or color deviation that would indicate a mismatch. The patterns seem to seamlessly integrate, reflecting the dress's aesthetics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the miniature roots beneath the figure arranged in a way that follows natural growth patterns and does not intersect or distort the figure’s legs or skirt?",
    "explanation": "The roots beneath the figure in Image B are arranged in a natural manner, resembling typical root growth patterns. They do not intersect the figure’s legs or skirt, maintaining a clean and realistic environment within the globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the miniature animals positioned at ground level with proper shadowing and scale relative to the figure, and do they have natural textures and forms without visible artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The miniature animals in Image B are positioned at ground level, appropriately scaled relative to the figure. They exhibit natural textures and forms and are consistent in detail without visible artifacts, enhancing the scene's realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
