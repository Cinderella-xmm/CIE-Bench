    "Question": "Q1: Does the geisha's face retain anatomical accuracy with natural proportions and smooth contours despite the stained glass transformation?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing the second image, the face's blurred area makes it difficult to assess anatomical accuracy, hence any evaluation is uncertain regarding natural proportions or smooth contours. Since the image is transformed into stained glass, accuracy cannot be precisely determined.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the cherry blossoms exhibit uniform glass-like textures with clear outlines and internal color gradations typical of stained glass, without appearing mushy or pixelated?",
    "explanation": "The cherry blossoms in the second image are well-rendered with clear outlines and an internal gradient that mirrors the stained glass style. They maintain a sharp appearance, without mushiness or pixelation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the peacock fan have a logical number of feather segments arranged symmetrically around a central spine, with no overlapping or misaligned parts?",
    "explanation": "The fan in the edited image has a structured arrangement with feather-like segments symmetrically distributed around its central spine, without overlap or misalignment. This is consistent with an artistic representation maintaining logical design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the background lines smoothly curved and interconnected without abrupt breaks, gaps, or inconsistent thicknesses that suggest rendering artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The background in the second image shows consistent line thickness, smooth curves, and no evident breaks or gaps. These features are synonymous with stained glass artwork's structured and continuous design, free from rendering artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
