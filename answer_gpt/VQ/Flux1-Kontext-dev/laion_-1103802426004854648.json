      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the body of the seahorse exhibit a consistent translucent pink glass appearance with visible subtle bubble textures, and are there no areas where the texture appears jagged, inconsistent, or artificially applied?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse's body appears to be rendered in a glossy finish that mimics a smooth, glass-like texture. The surface is even, with reflections and highlights contributing to a consistent glass-like appearance. However, the bubble texture described in the question is not visibly present. The body does not show any signs of being jagged or inconsistent, but rather it has a uniform shiny surface. Comparing with Image A, which depicts a plush toy with a soft, fuzzy texture, Image B distinctly presents a glass-like material, but without a bubble texture. Therefore, while the body is consistent in the glass texture, it lacks the described subtle bubble texture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the yellow belly rendered as a smooth, opaque glass surface with a precisely etched music note inside a heart, and are the edges of the symbol clean without blurring or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the yellow belly of the seahorse has a shiny and smooth glass-like appearance. The music note inside the heart is sharply defined with clean edges, indicating precision in its rendering. This is in contrast to Image A, where the symbol on the plush toy is embedded on a softer, fabric surface, not etched. Image B effectively presents a clear and precise etching, meeting the conditions of the question.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ribbons on the head and fins rendered as solid lavender glass with smooth surfaces and light reflections, and do they maintain their original shape without warping or appearing stretched or flattened?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows ribbons that appear solid and reflective, emulating a glass-like material. The lighting on them suggests a smooth surface with noticeable reflections. They seem to maintain their original plush shape without any distortion. In comparison to Image A, where the ribbons are fabric with no reflectivity, Image B shows a transformation into a glass-like material while preserving the basic shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the seahorse positioned on a flat, reflective black surface that shows clear mirror-like reflections of its base and lower body, and is the stand seamlessly integrated without gaps or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse rests on a black stand which appears reflective, providing a mirror-like reflection of the lower parts of the seahorse. There are no visible gaps or any indication that the seahorse is floating above the stand. The reflection is coherent with the high reflective quality of the glass-like material of the seahorse, supporting a seamless integration with the stand.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all elements—body, belly, fins, ribbons, and base—visually consistent in lighting, shadow, and material properties, with no mismatched highlights, color shifts, or artificial edges suggesting poor blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the various components of the seahorse, including the body, belly, fins, ribbons, and base, display a uniformity in lighting, shadow effects, and material properties. The glossy and reflective quality is consistently applied across all parts, ensuring there are no mismatches or artificial artifacts like glaring edges or abrupt color changes. Comparing with Image A, where different textures are transitioning for a plush toy, Image B achieves visual consistency in its rendered glass-like appearance.",
