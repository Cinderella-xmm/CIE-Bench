      "question": "Do the bold outlines precisely trace the edges of the player, basketball, hoop, and court without overlapping or cutting into the underlying forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, bold outlines are a characteristic feature of comic-style art. The outline should cleanly trace the edges of the key elements like the player, basketball, hoop, and court. By observing the outlines in Image B, they clearly follow the contours of the player, basketball, and hoop, without overlapping the internal features. The lines effectively define the shapes without cutting into them, which is typical for a comic-style rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dynamic action lines positioned along the direction of motion and do they avoid intersecting solid objects like the playerâ€™s body or the basketball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Dynamic action lines in comic-style art emphasize motion direction. In Image B, these lines should appear along the trajectory the player is moving towards, typically behind the moving objects to indicate speed. Upon analysis, Image B does not depict pertinent action lines intersecting or cutting through solid elements like the player's body or the basketball, maintaining clarity in the motion depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red and orange hues applied consistently across the image without causing visible color bleeding, banding, or loss of detail in areas such as the jersey fabric, skin tone, or wooden floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comic art style, flat colors are used, ensuring no color abnormalities like bleeding or banding. In Image B, consistent and solid application of red and orange hues is observed across elements like the jersey, skin, and court. The colors are well-contained, showing clarity and the necessary degree of detail without bleeding beyond defined color boundaries.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text overlay clearly legible, positioned outside the main subject area, and not covering any essential part of the player or basketball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comic-style images often include text overlays that should be readable and strategically positioned. In Image B, the text 'FACHIBALH' and 'PUURS GONES!' are well placed at the top and bottom respectively. These positions do not obstruct the player or basketball, ensuring that essential gameplay visuals remain unobstructed, thus maintaining readability and visual clarity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the comic panel border evenly drawn around the entire image, maintaining consistent thickness and not cropping any part of the player, hoop, or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comic panel borders help in framing the artwork and should be uniformly thick. In Image B, the border surrounds the entire image, maintaining consistency in its thickness, and does not intrude upon or crop critical elements like the player, hoop, or the audience background.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the basketball have exactly five fingers, correctly proportioned and naturally curved around the ball, with no extra digits or unnatural gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of hands must be anatomically correct with five fingers in comic illustrations. In Image B, the player's hand gripping the basketball presents appropriately five fingers arranged around the ball. The fingers are proportionate and naturally curved, confirming anatomical correctness without misleading features like extra digits or peculiar gaps.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the basketball fully spherical with visible seam lines and no flattened or distorted regions despite the comic-style rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comic-style imagery, the representation of spherical objects like a basketball should still reflect its spherical nature. In Image B, the basketball appears structurally spherical, with visible seam lines typical to basketball design. There are no apparent distortions or flattened areas, indicating the rendering remains true to the nature of the object.",
