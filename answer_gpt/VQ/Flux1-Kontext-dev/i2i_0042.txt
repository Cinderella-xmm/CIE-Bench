    "Question": "Q1: Are the person's arms and hands in a raised position that looks natural and consistent with their chibi-style transformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the person's arms and hands are raised above the shoulder level with their palms open, which is a typical pose often associated with excitement or presentation.

    "Question": "Q2: Does the added text 'Level 6 · Mega Meal' blend well with the background and does not introduce distracting artifacts or look unnaturally placed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Level 6 · Mega Meal' is clearly visible and seems to be an integrated part of the packaging design. Its bold, high-contrast letter format allows it to stand out without clashing with the background colors or elements. The placement above the chibi figure complements the display style of typical collectible packaging, suggesting a theme or level indicating a feature of the character.

    "Question": "Q3: Do the burgers and fries on the table retain their realistic texture, detail, and shape, appearing as if they were untouched by the transformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the burgers and fries displayed on the table retain a cartoonish texture and lack rich details such as shadowing or the nuanced texture seen in realistic food photographs. As part of the chibi style transformation within a toy-like packaging, they appear simplified, matching the artistic adjustment usually intended to be consistent with the rest of the chibi art style, which typically reduces detail for stylistic effect. Therefore, while the general forms are recognizable, the textures are not meant to be realistic.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Has the person been transformed into a chibi-style figure that maintains recognizable facial and body features without unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation into a chibi-style figure includes exaggerated proportions like a larger head and small limbs typical of such artwork. The blurred face does not affect the body analysis. Generally, the body maintains essential characteristics with simplified details. Chibi style inherently leads to loss of intricate detail for cuteness and stylization, thus the image lacks excessive unnatural textures and remains recognizable within its intended artistic scope.",
    "answer": "Yes"

This updated presentation includes a structured layout within an acrylic standee format, a trendy presentation that mimics existing market products. There are no evident distortions beyond the intended chibi stylistic choices.
