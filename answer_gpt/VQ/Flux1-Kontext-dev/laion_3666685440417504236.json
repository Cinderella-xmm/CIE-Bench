      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the dome, minaret, and arches inside the globe proportionally accurate and geometrically intact, with no warped edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the dome, minaret, and arches appear well-crafted, maintaining proportions that reflect their architectural integrity. The shapes are smooth, and the lines are straight without any obvious distortions or breaks. This is evident from the consistent curvature of the dome and the alignment of the minaret and arches which match standard architectural expectations. Combining this analysis with world knowledge about architectural design, it's clear that these elements are proportionally and geometrically intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the palm trees and cobblestone path inside the globe appear at a consistent scale with the architecture and follow a plausible layout leading to the entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees and cobblestone path are scaled to match the miniature architecture inside the globe. The size of the trees does not overshadow the building and seems appropriate compared to the scale of the structure. The cobblestone path is oriented in a manner that logically leads towards the entrance of the building, consistent with typical layout designs, combining visual cues and logical placement within a miniature diorama setting.",

      "question": "Are the Persian patterns on the exterior of the globe continuous, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the tilework seen on the original building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The globe in Image B showcases Persian patterns that are continuous and evenly spaced around the exterior. These designs mimic the intricate tilework seen on the original building in Image A, maintaining stylistic coherence with traditional Persian design. The repetition and symmetry observed indicate adherence to patterning techniques commonly used in Persian art, again corroborating the consistency in stylistic implementation with world knowledge of Persian patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the golden highlights on the dome and arches applied in a way that follows natural light interaction, with no flat, overly bright, or artificially drawn lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates subtle application of golden highlights, particularly on the dome and arches that reflect natural lighting conditions. The highlights are not overly bright or flat, suggesting a realistic interaction of light with the surfaces. This nuanced application avoids artificial appearances, aligning with what would naturally occur in real-world lighting scenarios on such surfaces, merging understandings of light physics with visual examination.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the boundary between the interior scene and the globeâ€™s surface clean and free of jagged edges, transparency glitches, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boundary in Image B between the interior scene and the globe surface appears smooth and well-integrated. There are no visible distortions, jagged edges, or transparency issues, indicating a successful craftsmanship in merging the interior with the globe. The transition is seamless, following logical design principles that prioritize quality rendering without glitches or unnatural visual effects.",
