      "question": "Do the plush toy versions of the chicken wings retain the correct anatomical shape and proportions of real wings, such as the joint areas and wing tips, without deformation or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chicken wings are depicted as plush toy versions, and the visual cues show a good attempt at mimicking the general shape and proportions of real chicken wings, including joint areas and wing tips. The fabric's contours suggest that the intended anatomical features are preserved without visible deformation or unnatural stretching. Considering this design goal and analyzing the intended resemblance, the wings appear consistent with real wings in shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bright orange pillow placed inside the white bowl properly scaled and shaped to fit within the bowl's boundaries without bulging or distorting the bowl’s edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange pillow is placed where a sauce bowl would be. Visual cues show that the pillow significantly exceeds the scaling required to fit the bowl, with its dimensions extending beyond the bowl’s boundary. It causes an unrealistic bulge, distorting the visual perception of the bowl itself. Based on these observations and considering the physical limitations in real-life fitting, the pillow does not fit properly within the bowl.",

      "question": "Does the light-colored wooden surface appear uniformly smooth with natural wood grain patterns and no visible digital artifacts or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background surface is a light-colored wooden surface. By analyzing the visual texture, the surface appears uniformly smooth without noticeable wood grain patterns that are typical in real wood textures. There are no visible digital artifacts or abrupt color shifts affecting the overall smoothness. Based on these consistent observations, the surface maintains uniform characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the golden-brown fabric of the plush wings display a subtle raised or granular texture that visually suggests a crunchy feel, while remaining consistent with the appearance of soft textile material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric of the plush wings exhibits a noticeable raised texture, suggesting a crunchy feel. However, the consistency indicates a textile appearance, contrasting with the crunchiness expected from real food textures. Analyzing the visual cues with common textile properties, the surface appears inconsistent with a crunchy effect while matching textile designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the orange pillow positioned in the same location relative to the plate and wings as the original sauce was, maintaining proper alignment and depth without overlapping or floating above the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange pillow replaces the sauce originally in the bowl. Comparing positions in both images, the pillow is centrally placed, corresponding to the sauce location. Both maintain relative alignment to the plate and wings without visible overlapping or appearing detached from the plate. Considering depth and alignment through direct comparison, the pillow is in similar position as the sauce was.",
