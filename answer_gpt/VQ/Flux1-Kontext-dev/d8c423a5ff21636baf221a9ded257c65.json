    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head-to-body ratio of the figure exaggerated but still structurally coherent, with no visible warping or misalignment of facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure shows a stylized head-to-body ratio that is characteristic of cartoon or toy-like representations. It maintains structural coherence as there are no visible distortions or misalignments, making the exaggerated styling visually acceptable.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dress exhibit a smooth, consistent porcelain-like surface with no rough patches, texture artifacts, or unnatural glare?",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the dress with a smooth, even surface, akin to porcelain with no visible texture artifacts or rough patches. The lighting is soft and consistent, avoiding unnatural glare.",

      "question": "Is the lamb positioned in the lap with sufficient volume and soft texture, and does it rest naturally within the hands without clipping or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lamb in Image B is designed with a rounded, full volume and rests naturally in the hands. Its soft texture visually suggests plushness, and it is integrated well without clipping issues or appearing to float.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base effectively aligns with the foreground plane and integrates seamlessly into the background area, casting correct shadows and maintaining realistic cohesion with no floating effects.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
