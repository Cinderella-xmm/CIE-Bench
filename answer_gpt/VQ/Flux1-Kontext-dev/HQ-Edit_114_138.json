      "question": "Does the silk robe exhibit natural fabric texture with consistent gold highlights and floral patterns that follow realistic light interaction and material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an artwork-style presentation where textures are simplified and stylized, as opposed to a realistic depiction of fabric. The silk robe in Image B uses bold colors and uniform patterns, removing details like natural fabric texture and light interaction found in Image A. Silk, especially real, tends to show varying highlights and shadows based on its texture and light, which Image B does not replicate due to its illustrative nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the book’s shape preserved with realistic page layers and depth, avoiding broken edges, inconsistent thickness, or floating components that disrupt its structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book appears flat and stylized, as is typical in illustrative or artistic renderings. Realistic page layers and depth, such as varied thickness or discernible individual pages, are minimized in favor of a cohesive graphic. The book in Image A shows more depth with visible individual pages and natural variations, which are lost in Image B's portrayal.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bookshelf designs integrated without altering the original shelf alignment, spacing, or wood grain texture, maintaining visual credibility and structural rationality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized version of the bookshelf, featuring simplified shapes and a decorative border that alters the original shelf alignment and spacing. The wood grain texture is also absent or reduced to flat colors. In Image A, the bookshelves show standard alignment, spacing, and wood grain texture, which contributes to structural rationality, all lost in Image B's illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bookmark panels appear correctly inserted between the book’s pages, with proper scale, orientation, and connection to the book, avoiding floating or misaligned placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any bookmark panels inserted between the book’s pages. The illustration focuses on graphic design elements where such details are not present. In Image A, no bookmarks are visible either, but the coherence of the book structure is intact. The question seems hypothetical as the edited image does not include bookmarks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features, particularly around the eyes and mouth, proportionally accurate and free from exaggerated or distorted shapes that compromise visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the details of the face in Image B are blurred, the stylized nature would typically result in simplified or exaggerated features as seen in graphic art. However, without specific details due to the blur, direct analysis of the facial feature proportions cannot be carried out. Therefore, the question does not apply under the current context.",
