    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the torso appear uniformly scaled and proportionally enlarged without visible warping or stretching of anatomical features such as shoulders, neck, or waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the torso appears proportionally correct without visible distortion in the anatomical features. The shoulders, neck, and waist are consistent with normal human proportions, reflecting a uniform scaling process.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the surface of the shirt uniformly matte with no glossy highlights or fabric weave patterns, indicating a polymer-like finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shirt's surface in Image B lacks visible fabric texture or weave patterns and does not exhibit glossy reflections. This suggests a matte, polymer-like finish without fabric-specific details.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the base under the figurine composed of clean, straight lines with smooth surfaces and subtle reflective highlights consistent with polished metal, and does it appear physically attached yet separable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B has smooth, clean lines with subtle reflective highlights characteristic of polished metal. Its appearance suggests it is physically attached to the figurine but potentially separable, as would be typical for display stands.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are clear and preserved without visible distortion or unnatural blending at the junction with the torso, even though the face is blurred. The transition between the face and torso appears smooth.",
