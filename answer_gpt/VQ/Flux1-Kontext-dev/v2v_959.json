      "question": "Do the red ski outfit, black helmet, and backpack maintain their original shapes and proportions without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red ski outfit, black helmet, and backpack are illustrated in an anime style typical with simplified shapes and proportions. They maintain an exaggerated and stylized appearance consistent with anime illustrations, which are often characterized by non-realistic proportions while preserving the essential attributes of clothing and accessories. Therefore, within the context of the anime style, they maintain their proportions according to the graphic design principles, which are inherently different from reality but consistent within their style.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the snow and rocks is depicted through simple lines and shading typical of anime illustrations, which prioritize stylistic representation over photorealism. Given the intended cartoon-like style, the textures present in the image are appropriate and coherent with the medium. Therefore, while they are not detailed in a realistic sense, within the context of anime styling, they are consistent and free of unnatural artifacts.",

The coherence between the character's actions and the environment adheres to the visual language of comics, where expressiveness can trump strict realism.",
