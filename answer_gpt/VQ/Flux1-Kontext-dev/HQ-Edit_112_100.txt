    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass dome surrounding the eagle exhibit natural transparency, smooth curvature, and realistic light refraction without distorting the eagle or background clouds?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B is designed to mimic a typical bell jar or display dome. It is essential for such a dome to possess transparency, which allows viewers to see the contents clearly. In Image B, the dome curves naturally and the transparency is maintained without any observable distortion of the eagle or the clouds behind it. The light reflection appears realistic, suggesting smooth curvature and refraction properties typically associated with glass. There are no visual cues indicating any distortion or warping, indicating that the qualities of the glass dome are accurately rendered.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the miniature clouds beneath the eagle’s wings three-dimensional, properly lit, and textured to match natural cloud formations without appearing artificial or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds under the eagle's wings need to have depth, lighting, and texture resembling real clouds. The clouds appear three-dimensional due to their shading and lighting, which suggests volume and mass. The texture and form of the clouds match natural cloud formations, with the proper gradation of light creating a realistic interaction with the eagle's wings and overall scene. There is no apparent artificiality or misalignment observed, indicating the clouds are properly integrated into the setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the gold leaf detail on the miniature clouds applied in a way that shows fine, reflective metallic texture without disrupting the cloud’s natural appearance or creating harsh highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, for the clouds to be embellished with gold leaf detail without disrupting natural appearance, the gold leaf must blend seamlessly into the cloud's texture. While it's indicated that the clouds have a natural appearance, the question requires observation of metallic reflectivity typical with gold leaf. Since there should not be harsh highlights or break in the cloud texture, upon examining visually, the highlights are soft and do not disrupt the overall appearance. However, without clear signs of reflective detailing typical of gold leaf, there is no explicit representation suggesting the application retains natural cloud look.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the dark wood base have natural wood texture, proper polish finish, and clearly engraved text, and is it positioned stably beneath the dome without appearing disconnected or disproportionately sized?",
    "explanation": "The base in Image B must exhibit qualities associated with well-crafted woodwork, such as an authentic wood texture and a proper polish finish. The base shows a dark sheen consistent with varnished wood, and the texture appears natural. The engraved text is clear and legible, suggesting good craftsmanship. Its positioning is stable, aligning correctly with the dome and does not exhibit any signs of disconnection or improper scaling relative to the dome's proportions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the brass compass roses evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and rendered with realistic metallic texture and scale relative to the dome and base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brass compass roses on the base require examination for spacing, shape, and texture. The compass roses are symmetrically placed and evenly spaced around the base, which is crucial for visual balance. The shapes are correct, matching the typical design of compass roses, and they display a metallic texture with reflective qualities appropriate for brass. Their scale is reasonable in relation to both the base and dome, suggesting thoughtful proportioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
