    "Question": "Q1: Are the wood-carved hat and scarf clearly distinguishable from the original fabric textures, with consistent grain patterns and engraved details that follow natural wood structure without distortion?",
    "explanation": "The edited image showcases a wood-carved hat and scarf that are meant to emulate fabric textures. In considering this, the appearance of the wood must include visually consistent grain patterns and engravings typical of wood structure. Analysis of Image B reveals that the hat and scarf exhibit traits of carved wood, with uniform grain patterns and natural wood details that are consistent and undistorted, offering a clear distinction from fabric textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the LEGO bricks form a continuous, anatomically plausible layer over the dog’s body without gaps, overlapping inconsistencies, or floating pieces that violate physical logic?",
    "explanation": "Anatomical plausibility warrants that LEGO bricks should be laid seamlessly on the dog without visual gaps or inconsistencies that contradict physical logic. Image B displays the hat as composed of block-like structures reminiscent of LEGO bricks, arranged in a coherent layer around the dog's head with no visible gaps or overlaps that compromise the visual or physical logic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the light-colored wooden tabletop background evenly lit and seamlessly integrated with the subject, without abrupt transitions or shadow mismatches that suggest poor compositing?",
    "explanation": "The background of Image B needs to be evenly lit and integrate smoothly with the subject. It should avoid harsh transitions or inconsistent shadowing that might point to poor compositing. The image reveals a smoothly lit wooden tabletop without abrupt lighting changes or mismatched shadows offering a seamless compositional integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ear flaps of the wood-carved hat properly shaped and positioned symmetrically on both sides of the dog’s head, without deformation or disproportionate scaling?",
    "explanation": "Symmetrical positioning and proper shaping indicate correct orientation and proportion of the wood-carved ear flaps. In Image B, these flaps are aligned symmetrically to the dog's head without signs of deformation or disproportionate scaling, contributing to balanced and aesthetically correct shaping.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the LEGO bricks exhibit consistent edge definition, proper shading, and logical placement across the dog’s body, avoiding blocky artifacts or color clumps that break visual continuity?",
    "explanation": "Effective LEGO design features consistent edges, proper shading, and logical placement. Analysis of Image B confirms that the LEGO-like elements around the dog's face display consistent edges and shading, and maintain logical placement without irregular artifacts or color clumps.",
    "answer": "Yes"
