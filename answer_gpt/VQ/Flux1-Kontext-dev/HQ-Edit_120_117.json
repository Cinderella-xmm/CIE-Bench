    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the outer surface of the globe smooth and uniformly curved without visible distortion or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the globe's outer surface appears smooth and uniformly curved, which is characteristic of a well-crafted glass or plastic dome used in decorative globes, thus avoiding distortions or jagged edges. The analysis involved recognizing common attributes of spherical surfaces, factoring in light reflections and smoothness.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the miniature lighthouse inside the globe have accurate window placements and structural symmetry matching the original lighthouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature lighthouse inside the globe in Image B exhibits windows placed symmetrically and in accordance with typical lighthouse architectural design. By comparing structural details such as window placements and tower shape without referring to the original, these are verified to match standard lighthouse designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waves made of translucent blue resin visually continuous with smooth surfaces and subtle internal reflections, showing no blocky or fragmented textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waves inside the globe appear as continuous forms with translucent characteristics, likely simulated with resin or similar material. Observing their smooth surfaces and the presence of subtle reflections indicates skilled crafting, which negates signs of blocky or fragmented textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden base flat and grounded beneath the globe, with visible wood grain and engraved lines that follow a consistent radial pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a wooden base which appears flat and properly grounds the globe. Visible wood grain contributes to realistic texture, while engraved lines form a radial pattern consistent with woodworking practices, thereby validating the description.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the painted clouds and distant mountains located behind the globe, creating a sense of depth without overlapping or intersecting with the globe's surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds and distant mountains within the globe appear behind the central lighthouse, adhering to standard perspective techniques by situating background elements away from the immediate foreground. There is no overlap or intersection disrupting the visual flow, maintaining depth perception.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the rocks display earthy brown and green tones while the water shows vibrant blue with gradient shading, maintaining color harmony across the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rocks in Image B have earthy brown and green tones, and the water displays vibrant shades of blue with gradient effects, typical for realistic aquatic scenes. This demonstrates an understanding of natural color usage, ensuring color harmony and coherence within the miniature scene.",
