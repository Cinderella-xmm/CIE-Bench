      "question": "Do the transformed plants maintain recognizable plant-like structures without unnatural appendages or disproportionate body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plants have been transformed into fantastical, mushroom-like structures with exaggerated features, such as floating spheres and glowing elements. These characteristics are not typical of natural plants. They maintain a certain plant-like form, but due to their enhanced and fantasy-oriented appearances, they do not fully adhere to natural plant structures. Therefore, they do include some disproportionate body parts, such as the spherical appendages and illuminated areas.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vine patterns on the leaves seamlessly blended with the leaf texture, showing no visible edges, clipping, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no standard leaves with vine patterns as might be found in a realistic setting. The foliage appears to be heavily stylized and part of a fantastical composition, with emphasis on glowing elements and textures that don't resemble natural leaf patterns. Since the image focuses on a magical and fantasy aesthetic, it lacks the intricate vine patterns expected in a natural leaf setting, thus blending and shading would not be applicable here.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the magical orbs replace the original flowers in the same positions and emit light that interacts realistically with nearby surfaces and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, magical orbs are present among the fantasy-like plants. They emit a glowing light, and this light interacts with the environment, such as reflecting off nearby surfaces and providing ambient light to the surrounding foliage. This interaction gives an impression of realism within the confines of a fantasy environment. There is an observable effort to position the orbs in a way that complements the overall magical setting.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shelves positioned above the ground with soft shadows beneath them that align with the light source and do not show unnatural gaps or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include shelves as Image A did. Instead, there are large pedestal-like structures that have replaced the shelving environment. These structures naturally emerge from the ground and are part of the surreal setting, thus not requiring or demonstrating traditional shadows or gaps associated with shelving. The image's focus on a fantasy landscape means that such comparisons are rendered moot, as there are no shelves or their corresponding shadows present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the iridescent foliage cascade from the ceiling in a way that follows the structural lines of the roof frame and allows light to diffuse naturally through its layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are cascades of foliage hanging from above, symbolizing a ceiling lined with plant life. These cascades extend from the overhead structure, suggesting the idea of being framed along the roof. The light diffusion seen among these hanging elements is consistent with the glowing and mystical ambiance of the scene, indicating some consideration for how light interacts across the layers of foliage. However, because of the fantastical nature of the setting, the foliage does not strictly follow realistic plant growth, but does provide a coherent visual flow.",
