      "question": "Does the 3D character's face retain the original facial details and proportions without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D character's face in Image B is blurred, and thus it does not retain facial details. As there are no discernible features or proportions visible due to this blur, any potential distortions or artifacts cannot be accurately assessed, leading to the conclusion of 'No'.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi-like proportions typically include shorter limbs and a larger head, but in Image B, the character displays elongated legs with a shorter torso, which can still be coherent for a stylized depiction.
