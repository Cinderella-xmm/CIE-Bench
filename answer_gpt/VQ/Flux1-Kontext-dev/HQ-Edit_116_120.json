      "question": "Is the spherical glass dome transparent and smooth, with no visible seams, distortions, or incorrect light refractions affecting the sandcastle inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears to be transparent and smooth, allowing for a clear view of the sandcastle inside without any seams or distortions. This is evidenced by the uninterrupted light passing through and the undistorted appearance of the sandcastle. Therefore, the conclusion regarding the dome's appearance is based on its visual cues suggesting transparency and smoothness, supported by the clear and consistent light behavior observed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the mahogany base have a natural wood texture and consistent thickness, and is it properly scaled to support the dome and sandcastle without appearing distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mahogany base in Image B displays a natural wood texture with a consistent thickness throughout. It is proportionally scaled to support the size of the dome and the sandcastle, as indicated by its balanced visual mass and the symmetrical fit of the dome. Analyzing these visual aspects suggests that the base is appropriately designed and not distorted.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glittering grains evenly distributed and subtle enough to mimic sand texture without obscuring fine architectural details of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grains on the sandcastle are evenly distributed, creating the illusion of sand. They subtly complement the architectural details without overpowering them, allowing the fine intricacies of the sandcastle to be visible. This observation is based on the perceived texture that simulates actual sand while preserving the castle's detailed features.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the seashells around the sandcastle clearly defined, appropriately small in scale, and free from pixelation or unnatural edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seashells surrounding the sandcastle in Image B are clearly defined and appropriately scaled to maintain realism within the context of the sandcastle. They lack pixelation or unnatural edge artifacts, which would otherwise detract from their believability. This evaluation is derived from the detailed and smooth appearance of the shells.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ceramic plaque with “Empire of the Shores” inscribed clearly readable, properly attached to the base, and displaying a uniform matte pearl surface without glare or texture mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plaque in Image B is clearly readable and appears to be properly affixed to the base. It shows a uniform matte pearl surface without any glare or texture mismatch, allowing the text to stand out clearly against its background. This inference is based on the legibility of the inscription and the consistent finish seen on the plaque.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the matte pearl finish uniformly applied across the sandcastle and surrounding shells, with no areas showing excessive shine or reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandcastle and the surrounding shells in Image B have a matte finish without any excessive shine or reflections that might suggest inconsistency in the application. The evenness of the finish is evident from the uniform appearance and lack of noticeable glare, indicating a consistent treatment across the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all architectural elements of the sandcastle (towers, stairs, arches) intact and geometrically consistent, with no stretching, bending, or missing sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The architectural elements of the sandcastle in Image B appear intact and geometrically consistent. The towers, stairs, and arches are all proportional and precise, with no visible stretching, bending, or missing parts. This conclusion is reached based on the overall symmetry and completeness of the structure as viewed in the image.",
