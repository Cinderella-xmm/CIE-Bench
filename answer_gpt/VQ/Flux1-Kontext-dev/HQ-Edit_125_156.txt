    "Question": "Q1: Is the magnifying glass placed among the books on the left bookshelf visually consistent in size, shape, and material, with a shadow extending toward the desk that matches the lighting direction from the window?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible magnifying glass placed among the books on the left bookshelf. Carefully analyzing the region where a magnifying glass could be placed, no object resembling a magnifying glass is discernible. Therefore, based on the visual cues, the requirement for consistency in size, shape, material, and shadow is moot as the magnifying glass is absent in Image B. Thus, it is valid to conclude the answer is 'No,' as the item does not exist in the current edited image.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the ghostly outline of the detective in a trench coat appear as a translucent, softly blended form within the stained-glass window pattern, maintaining the integrity of the original design and showing no jagged edges or inconsistent opacity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ghostly outline of the detective is visible against the stained-glass window. The figure is indeed softly blended within the window pattern, allowing parts of the window's intricate design to show through. The edges of the outline are smooth without jaggedness, maintaining a consistent opacity that complements the existing window pattern without overpowering it. Therefore, based on logical visual assessment, the answer is 'Yes,' as the outline integrates well while maintaining the original design integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the deep sepia tones applied consistently across all surfaces including the wooden desk, bookshelves, floor, and window, preserving fine details like wood grain and book spines without introducing blotchy or uneven color patches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a sepia tone application is evident across the desk, bookshelves, floor, and window. The sepia tones appear uniformly distributed, maintaining the fine details seen in wood grain and book spines without blotchiness. These features are preserved well. Based on the viewing, the image maintains its refined details consistently across its surfaces with no uneven colors visible. Therefore, the logical conclusion from observing these aspects would be 'Yes,' given the consistent and detailed application of color tones.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the title 'The Lost Legacy' positioned at the top of the image in a bold serif font that is clearly legible, proportionally scaled, and seamlessly overlaid without obscuring the ceiling details or causing visual disruption to the surrounding ornate patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'The Lost Legacy' is positioned prominently at the top. It is rendered in a bold serif font, which ensures clear legibility. The font's size seems proportional to the image's dimensions, and the positioning does not obscure the ceiling details or ornate patterns. There is no apparent visual disruption as the title stands out without penetrating the intricate design elements around it. Therefore, logically reasoning based on these observations, the answer is 'Yes,' as the title is well-integrated without any obscuring or disruptions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the added elements—the magnifying glass and the ghostly figure—integrate seamlessly into the scene without distorting adjacent objects, altering lighting logic, or introducing visible artifacts such as misaligned edges or texture repetition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ghostly figure is added, but there is no magnifying glass evident. The ghostly figure integrates well into the stained-glass design on the window without distorting surrounding objects or altering lighting logic, as the light continues to emanate uniformly. The integration is smooth without introducing misaligned edges or texture repetition around the figure. Since the magnifying glass is absent, logic dictates focusing on the ghostly figure, leading to the answer being 'Yes.' This figure visually blends appropriately without creating distortions or artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
