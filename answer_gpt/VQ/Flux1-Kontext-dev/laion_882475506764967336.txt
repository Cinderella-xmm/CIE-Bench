    "Question": "Q1: Are the table and chairs composed of uniformly sized brown and amber LEGO bricks with clean, interlocking edges and no visible breaks or misalignments in their surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the table and chairs appear to be constructed using standard LEGO bricks, which are known for their precise, interlocking structure. The bricks are typically uniform in size, and clean, consistent edges without misalignments are characteristic of LEGO brick assembly. Visual observation of the image confirms that the edges are clean and the composition is neat, indicating the use of LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the tabletop and chair seats display a consistent LEGO brick texture with repeating stud patterns and no unnatural stretching or distortion of individual bricks?",
    "explanation": "Stud patterns are a signature feature of LEGO bricks, and in Image B, the tabletop and chair seats display the recognizable texture of LEGO with the standard-sized studs visible across the surfaces. This consistency in texture is consistent with typical LEGO builds, where bricks fit together seamlessly without stretching or distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the central element on the table a LEGO-style plant made of green bricks with recognizable leaf shapes, and is it positioned centrally without overlapping or floating above the surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central element on the table seems to be constructed from green LEGO bricks designed to resemble a plant. The recognizable leaf shapes suggest a plant while maintaining the blocky characteristics of LEGO construction. The plant appears to be positioned centrally on the table, adhering to the surface without floating above it, indicating proper placement within the LEGO structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the furniture placed on a flat, gray LEGO baseplate that fits snugly beneath the table and chairs, with no overhang beyond the furniture edges and no visible seam between the baseplate and the real ground?",
    "explanation": "The image shows the furniture sitting on what appears to be a LEGO baseplate. This gray baseplate fits neatly beneath the table and chairs and appears to align with their edges without overhang. There is no visible seam suggesting the transition from LEGO to the real ground, aligning with the typical appearance of an all-LEGO environment where baseplates serve as surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged edges, pixelation, or unnatural lighting shadows around the LEGO furniture that suggest incomplete rendering or poor integration with the background?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the LEGO furniture clearly without visible artifacts. There are no jagged edges, pixelation, or unnatural shadows around the furniture, which are common issues in poor renderings or integrations. The lighting appears consistent and natural for the LEGO setup, indicative of a well-rendered scene without integration issues.",
    "answer": "No"
