      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the crystal facets on the sandcastle uniformly shaped and aligned with the original tower geometry, without any jagged or incomplete edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal facets on the sandcastle replicate the original tower geometry found in traditional sandcastles, showcasing intricate detailing and consistent geometric facets. The crystal model appears smooth and uniformly shaped, aligning well with the expected form of towers and turrets without noticeable errors or jagged edges. This observation is made by examining the consistent symmetry and regular geometric form of the facets, matching common world knowledge about refined crystal structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gemstones replace the seashells accurately in position and size, and do they exhibit smooth, reflective surfaces without floating above the sand or water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, gemstones are placed where seashells would typically be found, maintaining the general position and size as expected in such a transformation process. These gemstones demonstrate smooth, reflective surfaces, indicating a realistic touch of polish and finish. The smooth surfaces suggest appropriate execution without the odd positioning like floating above the expected ground level. Combining visual cues with knowledge of material properties, the transition from seashells to gemstones is accurate in terms of aesthetic representation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wave pattern on the frosted glass surface continuous and flowing, with no abrupt breaks or unnatural line interruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wave pattern visible on the frosted glass surface in Image B shows continuity and fluidity reminiscent of natural wave formations. Examining the glass, one can see a continuous flow without breaks or interruptions that would otherwise indicate defects. Through a comparison with transparent surfaces and natural wave patterns, the design utilizes smooth flowing lines that represent continuous motion, corroborating the natural expectation of wave patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the display case visible and straight, with no clipping or warping of the internal elements, and do they align with the perspective of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of the display case in Image B are visibly straight and align correctly with the perspective, consistent with architectural precision expected from modern display cases. No visual clipping or warping of internal elements is evident, providing a coherent and aligned scene that corresponds accurately to the expected setup based on optics and viewing angles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the red shovel with yellow handle fully visible and undistorted, lying flat on the surface without intersecting or appearing behind glass where it shouldnâ€™t be?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no presence of a red shovel with a yellow handle within the frosted glass display environment. This observation leverages the understanding that the shovel's transformation to other elements might reflect editing or omission, as visual cues and world knowledge indicate a different setting where tools like shovels are unlikely to be visible or permitted flat without interfering with glass features.",
