    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed king have smooth, flowing contours resembling water without jagged edges or disconnected fragments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed king is presented as a water-based entity. By analyzing the visual elements, the surface appears to have smooth and flowing contours, which is typically how water is depicted. There are no jagged edges or signs of fragmentation, suggesting a unified form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the flame elements on the transformed queen composed of layered, tapering shapes that follow natural fire motion without abrupt transitions or pixelated edges?",
    "explanation": "The flame elements on the transformed queen in Image B feature layered and tapering shapes characteristic of a natural fire's motion. The depiction flows seamlessly without harsh transitions or signs of pixelation, enhancing the fiery effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the transformed knights display consistent stone texture with clear carving lines and no distorted proportions or floating fragments?",
    "explanation": "The focus of the image is on the central pieces, not explicitly on the knights. Therefore, we must assume within the scope given that any consistency in texture and form applies to visible pieces. As there are no knights present, it's not applicable to evaluate their texture as the question implies nonexistent objects.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the transformed bishops rendered with soft, gradient edges and flowing lines that suggest motion without visible pixelation or ghosting?",
    "explanation": "The transformed bishops aren't directly visible in this image. The focus is placed on the central pieces, suggesting the intent may be redundant since these types of pieces are not explicitly shown in their traditional form or portrayed with motion-suggestive features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the transformed pawns show uniform glow without haloing or blurred outlines that separate them from the board?",
    "explanation": "The transformed pawns exhibit a uniform glow, particularly noticeable with electrical or flame-like elements on the pawns closest to the blue and orange entities, respectively. This glow connects cleanly onto the board without noticeable haloing or a blurred separation from their base, maintaining crisp outlines.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the transformed rook feature a tree trunk with visible bark texture and legible runes without stretching or warping of the structure?",
    "explanation": "The transformed rook is implied in the background but not distinctly visible like the depicted central pieces. Given the scope and content of the image focusing on the center characters, specifically tree trunk with visible bark texture with runes is inapplicable.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the shadows beneath all transformed pieces align with the light direction and object height, without appearing detached or incorrectly sized?",
    "explanation": "The shadows in Image B are consistent with the lighting direction and projected accurately according to the height and placement of the pieces. They appear well-integrated with the scene, matching the angles and light sources logically without appearing detached or wrongly sized.",
    "answer": "Yes"
