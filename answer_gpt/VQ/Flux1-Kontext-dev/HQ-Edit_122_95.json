    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the mosaic pattern on the saree maintain uniform tesserae size and alignment across the fabric, with no visible seams or distorted tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the saree is transformed into a more illustrative design with floral motifs instead of a mosaic pattern. The fabric appears to have a consistent illustration style without distinct tesserae or tiles. Therefore, the concept of tesserae size and alignment does not apply here.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arches and dome of the transformed building structurally coherent, with straight edges, consistent curvature, and no broken or misaligned geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architecture has been transformed into an artistic interpretation with bold outlines and color fills, which may not be perfectly realistic but are consistently applied within this style. The arches and dome in the edited image are drawn in a coherent manner matching the overall illustrative style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do both hands show five fingers each, with natural finger spacing and joint alignment, and no extra digits or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an artistic style where finer anatomical details may not be precise. However, both hands seem to depict five fingers each, with spacing that may not appear entirely natural due to the flattening of the illustrative style. Despite this, there are no extra digits or obviously unnatural bending.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floral motifs evenly distributed and proportionally sized relative to the surrounding architecture, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral motifs are integrated into the saree's design and appear evenly distributed across it. They are proportionally sized relative to the figures and do not seem to overlap incorrectly with the background architecture, as they are distinct elements of the saree design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the golden backdrop exhibit smooth gradient transitions and subtle surface variations, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural shine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden backdrop in Image B has a stylized appearance with bold colors and lines typical of an animated or illustrative style. There are no smooth gradient transitions or subtle surface variations; instead, the color changes are abrupt and deliberate as part of the artistic approach.",
