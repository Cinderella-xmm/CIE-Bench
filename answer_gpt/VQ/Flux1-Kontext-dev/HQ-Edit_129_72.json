    {

      "question": "Do the iridescent scales cover the cardinal’s body smoothly without visible seams, pixelation, or inconsistent color gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal does not exhibit iridescent scales; instead, it presents a smooth, naturally-feathered texture with a focus on a fiery, glowing appearance, especially in the wings and body which appear lit from within. There is no indication of pixelation, seams, or inconsistent gradients in this fiery depiction.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the flames emerging from the wingtips and tail oriented upward and shaped naturally, without abrupt edges or disconnected fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flames emanating from the cardinal’s wingtips and tail are depicted with an upward flow, reflecting a natural fire shape with smooth edges and continuous elements, creating a cohesive and realistic fiery effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glowing ember effect confined to the eye area, with no halo bleed onto the surrounding feathers or face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the fiery glow does not concentrate around the eye area; instead, it is spread across the wings, body, and surrounding blossoms, emphasizing a vibrant, fiery theme rather than a glow confined to one specific location.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the obsidian branch retain the original branch’s branching pattern and thickness, with a smooth, glassy surface free of cracks or texture inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branch upon which the cardinal is perched maintains a similar branching pattern and thickness to that in Image A, now appearing with a sleek, almost glass-like obsidian quality devoid of imperfections or inconsistencies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the flames on the blossoms directly connected to the petals, with no detached or floating flame elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blossoms feature fiery elements that appear to be directly connected to the petals, where the flames seamlessly incorporate into the floral structure without showing detached or floating segments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the snowflakes falling around the flaming elements evenly distributed, with no unnatural absence or clustering near the fire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict snowflakes at all; it instead focuses on an elemental contrast with the fiery depiction of the cardinal and blossoms. Thus, there is no interaction or distribution of snowflakes around the flaming elements to consider.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
