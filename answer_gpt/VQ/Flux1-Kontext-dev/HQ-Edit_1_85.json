    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the lace details on the blouse rendered with consistent texture and edge definition, avoiding jagged or artificial-looking patterns that break from realistic fabric behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lace details appear to be well-rendered, with a pattern that mimics the complexity and consistency expected from real lace fabric. The edges appear smooth and well-defined, avoiding any jagged or overly artificial look that would diverge from fabric behavior. This indicates a good translation of texture and edge definition without noticeable flaws.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the enlarged violin maintain correct proportions and undistorted structural elements such as the scroll, bridge, and f-holes, without visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violinâ€™s components such as the scroll, bridge, and f-holes appear proportionate and accurate. The representation respects the standard structure of a violin without visible warping or disproportions, which suggests a proper attention to maintaining its authentic form.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fingers on both hands correctly positioned and shaped, with no extra digits or distorted joints, maintaining natural human anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character's hands with anatomically correct fingers. The fingers appear natural, without any extra digits, distortions, or incorrect joints, reflecting an accurate depiction of human anatomy.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the overall surface texture consistent across the image, with no mismatched areas showing sudden changes in lighting, gloss, or material quality that suggest poor layer blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface texture seems consistent across all elements. The uniformity in lighting and glossiness suggests no abrupt changes in material quality, indicating good layer blending throughout the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all foreground elements (girl, violin, table, candlestick) maintain consistent depth and placement, avoiding floating or misplaced components that disrupt spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the placement and depth of the foreground elements seem coherently arranged. The girl, violin, table, and candlestick appear to occupy a realistic space without indications of floating or spatial inconsistencies, maintaining consistent spatial logic.",
