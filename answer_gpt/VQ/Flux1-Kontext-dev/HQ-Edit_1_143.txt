    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features of the scientist proportionally accurate and free from exaggerated or distorted shapes such as elongated eyes, misaligned nose, or uneven lip contours?",
    "explanation": "Image B is a stylized illustration, possibly aiming for a simplified representation rather than strict realism. The face is blurred, preventing a detailed assessment of specific features. However, based on the style, it likely doesn't aim for realistic proportions and may have exaggerated elements typical of illustrations.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the lab coat exhibit natural fabric folds and subtle shading consistent with real-world draping, without appearing uniformly flat or lacking depth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lab coat is illustrated in a style with limited shading and detail typical of an illustration, making it appear flat. This contrasts with real-world draping, which involves complex shading and detailed folds.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the hand holding the pipette have exactly five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and are the joints and knuckles positioned realistically?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the hand in a simplified artistic style. The hand lacks detailed features typical of realistic depictions, such as knuckle definition and lifelike curvature, which makes its realism questionable.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the test tubes display uniform liquid levels and clear glass surfaces with coherent reflections and refractions, without visible texture distortions or broken geometric outlines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the test tubes are illustrated simply, lacking detailed reflections or refractions that might be expected in a realistic depiction. The uniformity in liquid levels and geometric outlines is maintained, which suits the stylized art but does not display real-world complexity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the components of the microscope and adjacent control panel correctly aligned and proportionally scaled, with no misplaced parts or floating elements that violate physical logic?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the microscope and control panel drawn in a simplified and stylized manner typical of illustrations, but there are no apparent misalignments or floating elements that contradict physical logic within the art style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
