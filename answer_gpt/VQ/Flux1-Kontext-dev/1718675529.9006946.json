      "question": "Do the wave patterns along the shoreline consist of smooth, continuous geometric curves without jagged or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wave patterns appear as stylized, smooth geometric curves, which align with artistic interpretations common in illustrations. This type of representation is typical for simplifying complex natural wave patterns into more abstract forms, avoiding jagged or fragmented edges. Therefore, the wave patterns do consist of smooth, continuous geometric curves.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the palm trees along the right side of the beach represented as clean, straight vertical lines without irregular gaps or misplaced branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees are drawn in a stylized manner, featuring clean, straight lines that represent their trunks. This artistic simplification results in an orderly appearance with minimal irregularities, such as gaps or misplaced branches, which are common in realistic depictions. Thus, the trees are indeed represented as clean, straight vertical lines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky arranged in symmetrical, repeating patterns without visible distortion or mismatched edges between adjacent cloud shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds in Image B, depicted as abstract shapes, follow a stylized, repetitive design. This form tends to be consistent and less detailed than in real life, contributing to an appearance of symmetry and a lack of visible mismatched edges between cloud shapes. This approach is typical in art to maintain a neat and orderly visual style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire scene uniformly rendered in muted greens, blues, and warm oranges, with no areas exhibiting bright or out-of-place colors such as vivid cyan or yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is styled with a consistent color palette of muted tones, predominantly greens, blues, and warm oranges. The hues are balanced and coordinated, typical of a stylized illustrative work aiming for a harmonious look, without any vivid cyan or yellow disrupting the uniform color scheme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the rocks on the sandy shore appear proportionally consistent with the surrounding terrain, and are they positioned in a way that aligns with the slope and texture of the beach?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocks are depicted with an illustration style that might not stick strictly to realistic proportional representation. However, they are positioned in a manner that aligns visually with the slope and texture provided by the illustration, conforming to a stylized consistency typical in such artistic renderings, rather than precise geographic realism.",
