    "Question": "Q1: Is the anthropomorphic teddy bear scientist fully integrated into the image with smooth contours, consistent line weight, and no visible seams or misaligned textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear costume is designed to blend seamlessly into the surroundings. The contours are smooth and consistent, particularly around the hands and lab coat, which have clean lines without any signs of seams or misalignment. The textures are cohesively integrated with the overall digital art style, suggesting high-quality editing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the lab equipment illustrations (e.g., beakers, test tubes) proportionally accurate, geometrically intact, and aligned with the hand-drawn chalk style without jagged edges or unnatural shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lab equipment such as beakers and test tubes are presented with accurate proportions and clean geometric shapes that fit the overall style of the image. They maintain the hand-drawn chalk aesthetic, avoiding any jagged edges or unnatural shading, which indicates they are well-integrated and appropriately styled.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do all scientific symbols and doodles (such as planets, rockets, and formulas) have intact geometric forms, proper alignment, and no overlapping artifacts or misplaced lines?",
    "explanation": "The background doodles and symbols in Image B have intact and correctly formed geometric structures. There is consistency in style and alignment, with no observable overlap or disarray in line placement, maintaining clarity and coherence in the visual display, which confirms the absence of artifacts or misplaced lines.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the typography (e.g., 'JOYFUL', 'CURIOSITY') clearly legible, stylistically consistent with the doodles, and free from blurring, stretching, or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "The typography in Image B matches the hand-drawn chalk style of the doodles with legible text. Words like 'JOYFUL' and 'CURIOSITY' display appropriate alignment and clarity. They show no signs of blurring, stretching, or misalignment, which ensures consistency with the visual theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the animal characters (e.g., bear, rabbit) exhibit correct limb positioning, proportional body parts, and logical interaction with nearby objects without unnatural poses or deformations?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear and smaller bear exhibit correct limb positioning and proportionate body features. Their interaction with nearby objects, such as holding lab equipment, appears logical, without unnatural poses or distortions. The consistency in limb positioning and proportion supports a well-executed visual integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
