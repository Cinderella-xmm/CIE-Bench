    "Question": "Q1: Are the wood grain patterns across the surface of the boot evenly distributed and consistent with natural wood textures, avoiding artificial or repetitive patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we observe the boot's surface texture resembling wood grain, which is distributed across the boot. Analyzing this, the patterns are aligned and consistent with natural wood textures, showing even distribution and avoiding obvious repetition that might indicate artificial modification. Natural wood typically has flowing, non-uniform patterns, which are well-represented here.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the transitions between light and dark wood tones on the boot follow the same contour and depth as the original leather and rubber sections, ensuring no abrupt or unrealistic shifts in color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transitions between light and dark wood tones are analyzed by examining their alignment with the original contours of leather and rubber sections in a typical boot. These transitions appear smooth and consistent, accurately mirroring the depth and contours of such materials. There are no abrupt or unrealistic color shifts, indicating a high level of realism in the wood effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the lacing holes and surrounding reinforcement areas shaped precisely like the original metal hardware and fabric loops, without deformation or missing structural elements?",
    "explanation": "Upon examination, Image B showcases lacing holes and reinforcement areas that appear intact and well-formed, resembling the original structure of metal hardware and fabric loops found in Image A. They maintain their integrity with precise shaping and detail, indicating no deformation or missing elements in comparison to traditional hardware.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the wooden shelf flat, stable, and properly aligned beneath the boot, with no visible warping, floating, or unsupported edges that break physical logic?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the boot resting on a wooden shelf, which appears flat and stable with proper alignment. Analysis of support structures visually confirms no warping or unsupported edges that might suggest instability or floating. The alignment and stability are consistent with logical physical placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the boot retain its original three-dimensional shape, including toe box, heel, and ankle support, without any stretching, flattening, or irregular bulges?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals the boot's three-dimensional structural features such as the toe box, heel, and ankle support, all of which retain their intended shape without distortion. Comparison with a typical boot indicates no signs of stretching, flattening, or irregular bulging, maintaining a realistic 3D form similar to Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
