      "question": "Does the chibi version of the scientist retain the white lab coat and light blue shirt without any unnatural distortions in shape or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi version of the scientist is depicted wearing a white lab coat and a light blue shirt. The clothing's textures and shapes appear consistent with a stylized approach common in chibi illustrations, where emphasis is on simplicity and exaggerated features. The lab coat and shirt maintain their expected shapes and structures, with no visible distortions or unnatural textures. Given this, the depiction fits within the norms of chibi style, where simplicity and cutsie elements are emphasized.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scientist's beard and hair depicted naturally in the chibi style, without any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the chibi style character does not explicitly show detailed strands of beard or hair; instead, it presents a simplified, cartoon-like depiction typical of chibi artwork. This style inherently involves a reduction in detail, focusing on cuteness and simplicity rather than realism. The hair is depicted with basic shading and highlights, characteristic of chibi illustrations. There are no unnatural textures or anomalies present, aligning with typical styles found in chibi characters.",

      "question": "Do the background elements, including the bright green color and hexagonal patterns, enhance the chibi scientist stickers without causing any visual disruption or introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a bright green color with hexagonal patterns, providing a visually engaging and thematic backdrop that complements the chibi scientist stickers. This design choice is supportive of the overall chibi aesthetic, adding vivacity and structure without creating conflicts or distractions. The combination of bright colors and hexagonal motifs are common in stylized or cartoonish settings, contributing positively to the visual appeal without introducing any artifacts.",

      "question": "In all six poses, do the scientist's hands have the correct number of fingers and appear naturally shaped without any distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi scientist is illustrated in six different poses, each with visible hands. The drawing style adopts the chibi convention of simplification without omitting anatomical correctness. Examination of the hands across all poses shows that they have the correct number of fingers, and the shapes are consistent with chibi form standards. No distortions or unusual configurations are apparent, maintaining integrity in terms of anatomy despite the stylized approach.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scientist's expressions and actions in all six poses coherent and visually plausible, without any unnatural or distorted features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the chibi scientist is presented in varied poses and expressions, each reflecting a standard chibi approach of exaggerated emotions and simplified actions. These expressions and actions are coherent with the overall character design, employing typical illustrative techniques used for conveying cuteness and expressiveness in 2D forms. The poses are dynamically diverse, yet visually plausible without any distortions, aligning with the illustrative norms of chibi cartoons.",
