      "question": "Does the LEGO representation of the dog maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog appears to sit atop a stop sign inside a display case. The dog's body is well-proportioned and maintains structural consistency that resembles a realistic depiction, akin to a LEGO model. The sitting posture looks natural and does not present any visible distortions or artifacts that would undermine visual credibility.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gradient shading used for the sky and clouds preserve their natural appearance and depth without introducing any unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky and clouds in Image B exhibit a smooth transition from blue to white, typical of a clear sky with a few clouds. The gradient shading is consistent, with no visible unnatural textures or artifacts that would disrupt the natural appearance of this outdoor scene.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the LEGO-style stop sign retain its proper proportions and physical rationality, avoiding any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stop sign in Image B is octagonal and features the word 'STOP' clearly. It maintains proper proportions with crisp geometric lines that are visually coherent. There are no distortions or broken shapes that affect its structural appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the base and nameplate free of unnatural textures and artifacts, maintaining a natural appearance and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base and nameplate in Image B are visually coherent and present a smooth surface finish. The nameplate reads 'Golden Companion' and is free from visible unnatural textures or artifacts. It appears as a plausible representation for a display case of this style.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the transparent glass cube enclosure preserve its authenticity and natural appearance, without introducing any visual distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transparent glass cube enclosure in Image B surrounds the dog and stop sign. It maintains clarity and transparency that mimic real glass, without any distortions or artifacts that might compromise the natural appearance of a display case.",
