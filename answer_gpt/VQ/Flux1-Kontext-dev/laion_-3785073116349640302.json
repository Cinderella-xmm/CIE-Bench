    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the chibi versions of Ultraman and the creature proportionally scaled with rounded, simplified features that maintain their identifiable characteristics without distorted limbs or facial structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Ultraman and the creature are present with their original proportions, retaining detailed features. They do not exhibit the characteristically exaggerated and rounded features typical of chibi style, which simplifies characters to make them cute, often with larger heads and smaller bodies. Therefore, the figures remain in their realistic depiction rather than a chibi transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the chibi figures exhibit a consistent, smooth, glossy finish without visible texture breaks, uneven highlights, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the original comic book style details of Ultraman and the creature. Their surfaces show intricate textures typical of detailed illustrations rather than a smooth, glossy finish. Highlights and textures align with the illustrative character style, which naturally includes lines and shades that may appear as texture breaks or uneven highlights. This does not conform to the description of a chibi figure's smooth, glossy texture.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glittering dust particles evenly distributed in the air around the chibi figures, forming a soft, swirling motion that blends naturally with the background mist without clumping or artificial trails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates a globe-like effect around the comic book cover with stars or glittering particles in the background. These particles appear evenly distributed and swirl subtly around the primary image. This effect is integrated smoothly, without obvious clumping or artificial trails, creating a coherent visual in the context of a snow globe representation.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the outer globe clearly defined with a transparent spherical shape that contains all internal elements, and do the etched cosmic patterns on its surface appear correctly aligned and non-distorted across the curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outer globe is depicted as a snow globe encapsulating the cover image. The spherical shape is transparent and encompasses all internal elements, maintaining a clear definition. Cosmic-looking patterns or stars on its surface are aligned correctly with the curvature, ensuring they appear consistent and undistorted over the globe's surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base feature detailed metallic debris and rugged terrain that support the scene's scale and contrast with the chibi figures, without floating or misplaced objects or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a detailed base with metallic debris or rugged terrain. Instead, the scene is encased in a snow globe with no such base elements visible. The original cover has a standard flat base of a comic cover design, suggesting the portrayal remains consistent without any additional base elements.",
