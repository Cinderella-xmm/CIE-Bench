    "Question": "Q1: Does the church's façade maintain its original architectural shape and symmetry when rendered in porcelain, with no distorted columns, misaligned arches, or broken edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the church's facade within the snow globe maintains its architectural integrity. The intricate baroque details, such as the columns and arches, are accurately represented without signs of distortion or misalignment. The precise replication of the church's symmetry is evident, indicating careful preservation of the original architectural shape when it is miniaturized in porcelain.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are all human figures replaced with pewter models that have anatomically correct hands with no more than five fingers, and do they maintain natural postures without joint bending or limb distortion?",
    "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the original human figures are substituted with pewter models. These models appear to maintain human-like proportions and postures. However, inspecting closely for limb and joint details, as well as the number of fingers, reveals that there may be minor artistic stylizations not entirely adhering to anatomical precision, common in stylized figurines.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the café tables and umbrellas scaled down appropriately with intact shapes—specifically, do the umbrella canopies remain circular and the table legs remain straight and evenly spaced?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the café tables and umbrellas have been miniaturized to fit the snow globe's scene. The umbrellas maintain their circular shape, and table legs appear straight and evenly spaced, conforming to typical scaling practices in model construction where geometric accuracy is achieved despite size reduction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
