        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train and STOP sign appear geometrically simplified, utilizing a flat and abstract style characteristic of minimalist illustrations. The shapes remain correctly proportioned and consistent, without visible distortion or breakage. The red and gray colors are flat and solid, reinforcing the minimalist approach without compromising the structure.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green mountain outlines in Image B adopt a smooth, flowing contour typical of minimalist landscapes. The cool tones of the mountains complement the rest of the composition, maintaining a consistent visual style. The track lines are straight and regularly spaced, adhering to minimalist design principles, reinforcing their integration with the other elements.",

      "question": "Have the textures of the simplified train and STOP sign been maintained well enough to avoid loss of essential details and unnatural appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures are minimalistic and lack fine details, which is typical of minimalist art where simplicity is emphasized over intricate textures. However, essential elements like the colors and bold text remain intact, preserving enough details for recognition and avoiding an unnatural appearance. The train's basic form and the STOP sign are adequately represented.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the minimalist illustration maintain the correct spatial relationship between the train, STOP sign, and tracks without disrupting visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial arrangement among the train, STOP sign, and tracks is preserved in a manner akin to Image A. The objects are located similarly, maintaining alignment and perspective that ensure the composition looks believable and coherent. The visual relationship supports the overall illustration, fostering clear spatial awareness.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B uses cool tones, primarily expressed in the mountain shades and the gray of the train. These colors harmonize with the red and blue elements, imparting a sense of calm and maintaining consistency. The use of these tones complements the traffic safety theme by avoiding overwhelming or distracting hues, thereby enhancing clarity and focus on the STOP sign.",
