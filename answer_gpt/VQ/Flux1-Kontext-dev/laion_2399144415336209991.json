      "question": "Are the enhanced beads on the bride's shoulder straps evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the fabric's surface without appearing detached or unnaturally sharp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads on the bride's shoulder straps appear as part of the cartoonized depiction, meaning consistency in spacing and alignment can vary compared to realistic standards. However, they seem evenly spaced and flow with the fabric's contour in this stylized representation, and do not appear unnatural or detached, which is appropriate for the designated art style.",
