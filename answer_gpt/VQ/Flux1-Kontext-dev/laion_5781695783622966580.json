      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the hat symmetrical and aligned with the brim and crown, without jagged edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric patterns on the hat appear well-defined and uniformly aligned with the brim and crown. The symmetry of the patterns suggests careful design, as they maintain a consistent alignment throughout. There are no visible jagged edges or broken lines, indicating a seamless integration of the patterns into the hat's design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the brim follow the contour of the hat and reflect light naturally, without appearing as flat or detached patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold accents in Image B follow the contours and natural curves of the hat meticulously, enhancing its design. They are placed in a way that gives depth and a sense of dimension, suggesting they are integrated into the fabric instead of appearing as flat or separate patches. The accents also reflect light consistently, which adds a natural shine and realistic touch.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the turquoise, cream, and silver motifs smoothly blended into the fabric, without abrupt color shifts or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color motifs of turquoise, cream, and silver are smoothly and uniformly integrated into the fabric of the hat. There are no abrupt changes or harsh lines, and the transitions between the colors appear smooth. The lack of pixelation and crisp edges indicates a high-quality rendering of these design elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the patterns on the hat avoid intersecting or distorting the natural wave and volume of the hair, maintaining clear separation between the two?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the hat maintain their position without interfering with or intersecting the natural wave and volume of the hair. The hat's design stays distinctly separated from the hair below, preserving the natural appearance and flow of the hair.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the shape of the hatâ€™s brim and crown preserved with consistent thickness and curvature, without visible warping or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brim and crown of the hat in Image B maintain a consistent thickness and curvature, without any signs of warping or deformation. This consistency suggests that the shape is intended to be well-preserved and integrated harmoniously, leading to an aesthetically pleasing and realistic depiction of the hat.",
