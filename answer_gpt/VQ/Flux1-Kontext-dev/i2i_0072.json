      "question": "Are the body proportions and anatomical features of the person in 3D cartoon style coherent and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person's body proportions are typical of a 3D cartoon style, featuring simplified shapes and exaggerated textures that are coherent within the style's norms. The limbs and torso appear proportionate to one another, exhibiting fluid and smooth transitions without distortion. This is consistent with cartoon ergonomics, where realism is secondary to stylization, yet coherence within the cartoon universe is maintained.",

      "question": "Does the spinning metal shield have a natural metallic texture and motion blur indicating realistic spinning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shield in Image B has surface reflectivity and texturing that mimic the appearance of metal, suggesting a metallic texture. However, there is no evident motion blur around the shield, which would typically indicate realistic spinning. Without this motion blur visual cue, the shield does not convincingly display movement or spin.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition between the person and the new sci-fi training ground background seamless, with consistent lighting and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the figure is evenly distributed, matching the reflective surfaces and ambient lighting of the sci-fi background. Shadows and highlights are consistent with the surroundings, suggesting an integration between the person and the environment. The geometric and futuristic elements do not conflict, but rather create a cohesive scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the hands of the person in 3D cartoon style have a natural number of fingers with shapes and lines conforming to cartoon ergonomics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D cartoon style person appears to have hands conforming to cartoon ergonomics. They have a simplified structure with four fingers, which is common in cartoons for stylized representation. The shape and curvature reflect typical cartoon hand design, promoting simplified and expressive character design without anatomical accuracy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the color, lighting, and perspective of the 3D cartoon person harmonize with the sci-fi training ground background, contributing to a visually credible scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color scheme and lighting of the person complement the sci-fi training ground environment. The shading and reflective properties match the vivid neon and metallic elements in the background, creating a unified perspective that is visually plausible within the stylized and thematic context of the scene.",
