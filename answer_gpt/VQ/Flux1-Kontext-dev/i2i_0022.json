      "question": "Does the cat’s curled-up posture in the chibi illustration match the original position on the car hood and maintain structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted in a curled-up posture, which closely resembles the original position as seen in Image A on the car hood. Despite stylization, the general form and structure of the cat's body are consistent with the position and posture visible in Image A, where its positioning appears natural and similar.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gradient color blocks used to depict the cat’s fur smooth and free from unnatural textures or color blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's fur is illustrated using smooth gradient color blocks with some stylization typical of illustration techniques. These do not contain any overly harsh or unnatural textures, meaning the visual representation of fur uses gradation without disruptive color blocks.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the car appear as a curved surface with reflection lines only, maintaining its structural integrity and avoiding obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B eliminates the car entirely, focusing only on the cat illustration as cut out from its original context. Instead, it provides a smooth background without any reflection lines or curved surface artifacts typically seen on cars as in Image A, and so it does not maintain the car's structural integrity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sticker outlined with a thick white line and does it have a transparent background, retaining the visual coherence of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat illustration is outlined with a thick white line, indicating it is styled as a sticker. Furthermore, the background appears to be designed as transparent since there is no visible background scene retained other than gradient shading behind the cat, which satisfies the sticker aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have any unnatural textures been introduced, or have key details of the cat and car been lost in the chibi illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration retains the fundamental shape and posture of the cat but does lose some key details and adds a stylized texture typical of illustrations rather than photorealistic images. The car is completely removed, losing its details, indicating that the illustration does not retain full realism.",
