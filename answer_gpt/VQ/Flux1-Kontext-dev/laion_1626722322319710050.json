    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the metallic statue have five fingers on each hand, with natural joint angles and smooth surface transitions, and no visible seams or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic statue appears to have hands with fingers that are naturally positioned, with smooth joint angles and surface transitions. The overall geometry of the hands looks consistent and without visible seams or distortions. Statues of this type typically have detailed and smoothly rendered hands, which aligns with common sculptural practices.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leaves of the miniature trees semi-transparent, allowing light to pass through them, and positioned at a distance from the statue that matches their reduced scale without overlapping the figure unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature trees inside the glass dome seem to have leaves that are semi-transparent, as suggested by the way they interact with light in the image. They are positioned at a distance from the statue that seems proportionate to their scale, not overlapping the figure unnaturally. This creates a realistic miniature environment, which is often desired in such presentations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the engraved plaques flush with the base surface, with readable text and consistent depth, and do they follow the contour of the pedestal without appearing detached or warped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the engraved plaques appear to be flush with the base surface, showing readable text with consistent depth. They seem to follow the contour of the pedestal well, without any detachment or warping visible, which is typically a sign of high-quality rendering in edited or artistic images.",

      "question": "Is the glass dome fully transparent with smooth, continuous curvature, showing accurate reflections of nearby objects and sky, and free from jagged edges or internal distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears fully transparent with a smooth and continuous curvature. It shows accurate reflections of the sky and nearby trees, characteristic of high-quality glass objects. There are no visible jagged edges or internal distortions, which suggests careful attention to design and rendering.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dome stand feature a polished stone surface with subtle texture variation, and are the vine patterns clearly defined, following natural growth patterns without breaking or repeating unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dome stand with a polished stone surface, exhibiting subtle texture variations typical of stone. The vine patterns are clearly defined and appear to follow a natural growth pattern without any breaks or unnatural repetitions, which suggests meticulous crafting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the glass dome positioned above the statue and base without clipping through any part of the figure or pedestal, and does it rest securely on the dome stand without floating or tilting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome is positioned perfectly above the statue and base. It does not clip through any parts of the figure or pedestal and seems to rest securely on the dome stand. There is no evidence of it floating or tilting, indicating a proper alignment and support structure.",
