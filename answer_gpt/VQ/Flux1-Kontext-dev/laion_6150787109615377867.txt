    "Question": "Q1: Does the gear surface on the tabletop show consistent metallic sheen and detailed engravings without blurred or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "The gear surface on the tabletop of Image B features a consistent metallic sheen that reflects light in a uniform manner. The engravings are intricately detailed, showcasing clear patterns and symbols that are well-defined. There are no blurred or jagged edges present, indicating precision in the design and craftsmanship. My world knowledge informs me that well-crafted engravings on metal surfaces maintain consistent texture and integrity, which is evident in this image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the piston-driven limbs symmetrically arranged and proportionally scaled to the central column, with clearly defined joints and no bent or broken segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, The piston-driven limbs attached to the central column are symmetrically arranged on either side of the column. Each limb appears proportionally scaled relative to its location, maintaining balance to support the structure. The joints are clearly defined, allowing a realistic articulated appearance without any bent or broken segments. Based on the understanding of mechanical design, symmetry and clear joint definitions are essential for structural integrity, which is demonstrated effectively in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the steam vents evenly spaced along the central column and properly embedded into the metal surface without appearing detached or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, steam vents are visible as parts integrated into the central column's design. They appear evenly spaced along the column, contributing to an orderly layout. The vents are embedded within the metal surface, aligning perfectly without any detachment or misalignment. Proper spacing and integration into the surface are typical of well-designed steam-punk aesthetics, ensuring functionality along with aesthetic value.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the cog patterns and dials on the base have intact geometric shapes with uniform spacing and no overlapping or incomplete features?",
    "explanation": "The base of Image B showcases cog patterns and dials that have consistent geometric shapes with precise and uniform spacing. There are no overlapping or incomplete features visible, demonstrating careful attention to detail in their design. Geometric integrity and spatial uniformity are crucial in mechanical objects for both function and design, which is well represented in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the brass and copper accents clearly differentiated from the silver metal by color and reflectivity, without unnatural gradients or texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The brass and copper accents in Image B are distinguishable from the surrounding metals primarily by their color and light reflectivity. These accents have a warm hue and a reflective surface that commonly characterizes these materials, standing out against any silver or different colored parts. There are no unnatural gradients or texture artifacts evident, which implies a well-thought application of these materials to enhance visual clarity and contrast.",
    "answer": "Yes"
