      "question": "Does the enhanced chandelier retain its symmetrical structure and realistic crystal texture, with no visible distortion or irregularities in its shape or lighting reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chandelier in Image B maintains a symmetrical appearance with a consistent and realistic representation of crystal texture. The lighting reflections are distributed evenly, without irregularities that disrupt the realistic portrayal. Knowledge of chandelier design suggests that symmetry is typical, and reflections should follow the light source's pattern. Based on these observations, the chandelier appears well-integrated into the overall scene without distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the newly added patterns on the ceiling consistent in style and scale with the existing decorative elements, and do they blend seamlessly without creating visual breaks or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ceiling patterns in Image B appear consistent with existing decorative elements. They match in style and scale, creating a cohesive look without unnatural edges or visual breaks. Historical knowledge of ornate ceiling designs suggests a harmonious integration is crucial for visual continuity. The seamless blending observed in the image supports this requirement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the silhouette figures in the audience retain recognizable human postures and relative spacing, avoiding unnatural clustering or elongation that would compromise spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows silhouette figures with recognizable human posture and appropriate spacing, maintaining spatial logic. The audience is seated in well-aligned rows, consistent with typical theatre seating arrangements. Experience with large gatherings in venues suggests avoiding unnatural clustering to preserve believability in the composition's spatial arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sepia tone evenly applied across all surfaces, maintaining visible texture differences between materials such as the wooden floor, piano finish, and gilded ceiling, without introducing muddy or oversaturated areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sepia tone in Image B is evenly applied, allowing for visible texture differences between distinct materials like the wooden floor and the piano finish. The ceiling, with gilded elements, maintains its textural details without becoming muddy or oversaturated, suggesting a careful application of color that respects material characteristics. Such an understanding typically supports the nuance in texture often needed in interior design photography.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the grand piano centered correctly on the stage with accurate perspective, intact legs, and natural shadowing that matches the light source from above, without any deformation or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grand piano is centrally placed on the stage with intact legs. The perspective is accurate, showcasing natural shadowing consistent with the chandelier's lighting above. A proper understanding of stage setups indicates these aspects should align for realistic perspective and stability within the scene, which is maintained here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the text “AN EVENING OF CLASSICAL MAJESTY” clearly visible at the top of the image, properly aligned within the frame, and rendered with crisp edges and consistent stroke weight, without interfering with background details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is clearly visible at the top, with proper alignment within the frame. The rendering offers crisp edges and consistent stroke weight, without interference with the detailed background. Graphic design principles suggest that text should complement, not obscure, the visual content, and this implementation meets such standards.",
