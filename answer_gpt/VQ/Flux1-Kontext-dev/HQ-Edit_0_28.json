      "question": "Are the abstract geometric patterns on the man's robe seamlessly integrated into the fabric without introducing visible texture mismatches, jagged edges, or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, there are no visible signs of texture mismatches, jagged edges, or unnatural color shifts. The patterns appear to be uniformly applied to the robe, which suggests a seamless integration. This conclusion relies on visual inspection where smoothness and color consistency are key indicators of seamless integration.",

      "question": "Do the transformed lamp bases retain recognizable brass-like material properties and maintain proportional geometry consistent with their original structure when stylized as corner flourishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the corners of the frame have been stylized to reflect the lamp bases. They retain a brass-like appearance characterized by metallic shine and hue. The shape and proportion consistency is clear, as the stylized corner flourishes resemble the lamp bases in both shape and structure, which confirms preservation of material properties and geometry.",

      "question": "Is the extended portion of the bookcase visually continuous with the original section, showing consistent shelf spacing, book alignment, and lighting without visible seams or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bookcase that extends uniformly. The shelf spacing and book alignment are consistent throughout, with no apparent seams or distortions interrupting the visual continuity. The lighting is uniform from left to right, supporting the seamless extension of the bookcase.",

      "question": "Are the script elements embedded within the bookcase surface rendered with appropriate transparency and scale so they do not obscure books or create unnatural layering effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the script elements on the bookcase are minimal and unobtrusive. They are scaled and placed without overshadowing the book arrangement or causing unnatural layering effects. Transparency is adequate to avoid interference with the book display.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the area intended for inspirational quotes display a clean, unobstructed region with consistent lighting and texture that allows for future text placement without visual disruption?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the space around the image is thoughtfully laid out to accommodate text. The lighting and texture within the intended area are consistent, providing a clean and unobstructed region for potential text overlay. The design encourages future text placement without causing any visual distraction.",
