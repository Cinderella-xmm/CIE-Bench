    "Question": "Q1: Does the birdâ€™s body maintain accurate proportions and feather structure, with no distorted limbs, misplaced joints, or exaggerated features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bird appears well-proportioned with realistic feather structure. The body width, tail length, and positioning of wings are consistent to that of a natural bird, specifically a blue jay. There are no obvious distortions, misplaced joints, or exaggerated features visible. The bird sits comfortably on the perch, and the appearance matches the realistic nature expected from the species, suggesting a detailed and accurate depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the glass dome transparent with smooth surfaces, showing consistent reflections and refractions without visible seams, distortions, or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears transparent with smooth surface characteristics. The reflection and refraction of light are consistent and natural, enhancing the view of the bird inside without any noticeable seams or distortions. There is a subtle reflection that aligns well with a smooth and polished structure, suggesting a well-rendered visual element with no pixelation apparent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the wooden perch textured with realistic grain and positioned securely under the bird, with no gaps or floating sections suggesting instability?",
    "explanation": "The wooden perch in Image B displays realistic wood grain texture and appears natural. It is positioned securely under the bird, maintaining a sense of stability and support for the bird that sits on it. There are no visible gaps or floating sections, indicating solid placement and realistic depiction of wood characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the ivy vines curve naturally upward along the structure, with leaves spaced appropriately and no overlapping or clipping through the glass dome or bird?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no ivy vines curving upwards along the structure visible around the bird within the glass dome; instead, there is greenery and moss around the wooden perch. The leaves and natural components do not overlap or clip through the glass dome or bird, but are well-integrated into the display respecting spatial confines of the glass dome. The composition remains natural with no inappropriate overlapping suggesting an orderly arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the crafted leaves and tree stump proportionally small compared to the bird, with visible texture details and positioned on the moss-covered base without appearing out of place or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "The crafted leaves and tree stump in Image B present a realistic scale that maintains proportionality with the bird. The leaves exhibit visible texture details and are seated on a moss-covered base, appearing well-integrated into the setting without misalignment. This arrangement complements the bird while appearing to be part of a harmonious miniature ecosystem, without seeming out of place or exaggerated.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the moss-covered base show variation in color and texture, resembling real organic growth, with no sharp edges or uniformity suggesting digital pasting?",
    "explanation": "The moss-covered base in Image B shows variations in color and texture, which resemble organic growth. The subtle changes and textured appearance contribute to a realistic portrayal of natural moss, with uneven and softened edges that avoid the sharpness or uniform look characteristic of digital pasting. The visual consistency and detail suggest genuine surface dynamics of natural material.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are shadows cast by the bird, perch, and dome consistent with the light source in the upper right, with soft gradients and no mismatched highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast by the bird, perch, and dome correspond well with the apparent light source in the upper right. The gradients are soft, creating a natural transition that reflects consistent lighting. There are no mismatched highlights; rather, the interplay between light and shadow fits together in a coherent visual manner, indicating proper attention to light dynamics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
