    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed bottle maintain the same elongated vertical silhouette as the original dress, with no compression or stretching of the form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the bottle does maintain an elongated vertical silhouette similar to that of the dress in Image A. The form is consistent with the expected shape change from fabric to glass without noticeable compression or stretching. This observation is made based on the understanding of object transformation preserving the inherent physical structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the petal motifs clearly visible as raised embossments on the glass surface, with consistent depth and spacing matching the original dress's design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petal motifs on the bottle appear as raised designs with a consistent appearance, suggesting embossment on the glass surface. Comparing with Image A, the motifs maintain similar depth and spacing, reflecting the intricate design choice in maintaining consistency between dress and bottle decor.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cap shaped like a stylized red flower with natural petal curvature and symmetry, and does it sit properly on the bottle neck without floating or overlapping unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cap as a stylized red flower sitting flush on the bottle neck. The petals display realistic curvature and symmetry, aligning with natural designs. Utilizing knowledge of object placement, the cap does not show signs of unnatural floatation or overlap, indicating proper integration.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the metallic label seamlessly attached to the glass surface with smooth edges, realistic reflection, and legible cursive text, without blurring, misalignment, or shadow mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals the metallic label is uniformly attached with no visible disruption on the glass surface. The text appears clear and well-defined in cursive form, and reflections do not show distortion, indicating precise application without notable errors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the neck, body, and base of the bottle proportionally balanced and structurally sound, with no unnatural tapering or abrupt shape changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle exhibits a proportional balance between the neck, body, and base, which suggests structural integrity. There are no signs of abrupt tapering or unnatural alterations to the bottleâ€™s shape, corroborating with the expected continuity in design transformation from dress to glass bottle.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, pixelation, or color bleeding at the boundary where the fabric dress transitions into the glass bottle, indicating poor blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit visible seams, pixelation, or color bleeding at the transition from fabric to glass. The blending is smoothly executed, ensuring a seamless transformation appearance. Using world knowledge of digital image editing, this indicates high-quality rendering and attention to detail.",
