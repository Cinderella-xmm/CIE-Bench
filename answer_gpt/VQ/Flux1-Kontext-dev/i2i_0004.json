      "question": "Does the enlarged head appear natural and maintain structural coherence without distortion or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the head's appearance is stylized and larger relative to the body, which is a common characteristic of bobbleheads or figures designed for humorous or artistic exaggeration. However, the styling does not translate to natural structural coherence due to the disproportion between the enlarged head and smaller body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cartoonified body free of obvious artifacts and maintains a certain sense of realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body has been altered to a stylized, cartoonish form. There's no evidence of significant artifacts, and the clothing details—like the T-shirt and blazer—are visually coherent. The realism comes from preserving clothing textures and shadows, contributing to the feasible look of a caricature doll.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the bobblehead on the bookshelf look visually plausible and structurally consistent with the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bobblehead in Image B appears positioned on a flat surface among books. Given that bookcases are typical locations for displaying small decorative figures, the placement seems plausible. The scale and shadows are consistent with the environment, reinforcing structural consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the face retained its accuracy with no loss of fine details or introduction of unnatural textures?",

      "question": "Does the combination of an accurate face and a cartoonified body achieve coherence and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The combination of a realistically styled face with a cartoonified body is an intentional stylistic choice often used in humorous representations such as bobbleheads. While this does create a distinctive and playful appearance, it doesn’t achieve a natural sense in terms of human anatomy, but it is coherent within the intended artistic style.",
