    "Question": "Q1: Do the crystal wands have smooth, continuous surfaces with consistent refraction and no visible digital artifacts or irregularities in shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal wands have been placed upright, and their surfaces appear smooth and continuous. The light refraction throughout each wand is consistent, giving a clear impression of real crystal or glass. There are no visible digital artifacts or irregularities that suggest digital manipulation, indicating the wands are portrayed accurately.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the etched floral patterns on the crystal vase evenly distributed, continuous, and visually integrated into the surface without breaking lines or inconsistent shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the etched floral patterns appear on the lace surrounding the top of the vase, not on the vase itself, so there are no etched patterns on the crystal vase to analyze. The lace with these patterns is evenly wrapped around the vase, maintaining continuity and consistent shading, which integrates visually with the overall presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the carved crystal ribbon fully formed with intact floral motifs and no visible breaks, overlaps, or flattened areas that suggest a 2D-to-3D conversion error?",
    "explanation": "The carved crystal ribbon is not actually present in Image B. Instead, a lace ribbon is wrapped around the top of the vase. This lace has floral motifs that are intact and well-formed without any visible breaks or overlaps. It does not appear to have any conversion errors as it maintains its three-dimensional appearance and texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the reflection on the mirrored surface show a clear, undistorted image of the crystal vase and its contents, with proper symmetry and matching lighting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection of the crystal vase on the mirrored surface is clear and undistorted. The reflection accurately matches the position and shape of the vase and its contents, showing proper symmetry, and the lighting in the reflection matches the lighting observed on the real objects, contributing to the realistic portrayal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the pearls uniformly sized, evenly spaced, and free from warping or blurring that suggests compression or incorrect rendering due to the crystal vase?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not feature pearls inside the vase. Instead, it contains crystal wands. There are no pearls visible, thus rendering the evaluation of pearls in this image irrelevant. Given the absence of pearls, any potential concerns regarding compression or incorrect rendering do not apply here.",
    "answer": "No"
