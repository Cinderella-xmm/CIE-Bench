      "question": "Does the crystal cloche have smooth, continuous curvature with natural light refraction and no visible seams or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cloche encasing the birdhouse has a smooth, continuous curvature, indicative of careful craftsmanship and design that simulates real glass objects. The light refracting through and along its surface appears natural, without any visible seams or jagged edges, which suggests a high level of attention to detail in the rendering of its material properties.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sapphire-colored shingles uniformly textured and do the gold details follow the roofâ€™s architectural contours without appearing artificially painted or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shingles on the roof in Image B exhibit a uniform texture, with each shingle fitting seamlessly next to the other. The gold details are intricately designed to follow the architectural contours, enhancing the natural aesthetic of the roof without appearing superficially attached or mismatched to the surface.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the flower beds at the entrance have natural plant textures, correct scale relative to the birdhouse, and sit flush with the ground surface without floating or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flower beds at the entrance of the birdhouse in Image B are rendered with realistic plant textures, meaning they appear lifelike and three-dimensional. They are appropriately scaled in relation to the birdhouse's miniature setting and are well integrated with the ground, without any visual indication of floating or clipping issues.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the woodland creatures visible only through the window openings, positioned behind glass, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with the ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woodland creatures are not confined to window openings behind glass; they appear at the base of the birdhouse, which doesn't fit the description given. Therefore, this does not satisfy the condition described in the question.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the grassy mound have natural undulations, consistent grass coverage, and a seamless transition to the birdhouse base without gaps or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grassy mound in Image B is depicted with natural undulations, giving the appearance of a small, real hill. The grass covers the surface evenly, transitioning smoothly to the birdhouse base without any visible gaps or sections that seem disconnected, maintaining the visual integrity of the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do all added elements (cloche, flowers, creatures, mound) respond to light consistently with the same direction and intensity as the original birdhouse and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all added elements, including the cloche, flowers, creatures, and grassy mound, are illuminated consistently in accordance with the overall lighting conditions of the background and the original birdhouse. The shadows and highlights across these elements align with the existing light direction and intensity, creating a cohesive and realistic scene.",
