      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the crystalline hair of the water spirit follow the natural downward trajectory of the original waterfall, maintaining smooth, continuous flow lines that align with the surrounding rock contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair of the water spirit is designed to resemble the flow of a waterfall, showing smooth, continuous lines that suggest fluid movement. The strands descend in a manner similar to water falling down a rocky surface, maintaining a natural trajectory and fitting within the greenery of the background. This consistency shows the artist's intention to create a seamless transformation from waterfall to mystical figure, keeping aligned with the contours of the rocks and the natural flow pattern seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the luminescent blue hue of the water spirit evenly distributed and softly blended into the surrounding gray and dark rock surfaces without sharp edges or unnatural color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue hue of the water spirit is smoothly blended into the environment, creating a visually cohesive look. The luminescence is evenly distributed without abrupt transitions or unnatural bleeding into the darker rock areas, showing a well-executed integration of the supernatural element into the natural setting. This implies attention to maintaining visual harmony rather than disrupting the original color palette seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vine-like appendages have consistent leaf shapes, spacing, and textures that match the surrounding vegetation, and do they grow naturally from the spiritâ€™s body without floating or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vine-like appendages coming from the spirit's body are crafted to mimic natural vine growth, with consistent leaf shapes and spacing. The texture and coloring match the surrounding foliage, making them appear as a part of the environment rather than separate elements. They seem to grow organically from the spirit's body without any indication of floating or misalignment, aligning well with the vegetation in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the glowing basin reflect light in a way that matches the direction of the falling water and surrounding environment, showing coherent wave patterns and no flat or uniform glow that contradicts natural light behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing basin in Image B is shown with light reflections that align with the water's trajectory. It displays wave patterns coherent with how light would interact with a water surface, maintaining the dynamic behavior seen in natural water reflection. There is no flat or overly uniform glow contradicting how light behaves in an environment like that displayed in Image A.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crystalline surfaces of the spirit composed of clear, defined facets with realistic light refraction and shadowing, avoiding pixelation, smudging, or repetitive patterns that suggest digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystalline surfaces in Image B are depicted with attention to detail, showing defined facets just like how light interacts with a crystalline material. The image avoids pixelation or smudging that would suggest digital imperfections. Light refraction and shadowing are realistic and help maintain an illusion of depth and dimension, contributing to the overall quality and sophistication of the edit, without the digital artifacting issues that could arise.",
