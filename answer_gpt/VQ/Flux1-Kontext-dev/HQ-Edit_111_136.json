      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the white chiton with gold accents on the woman’s body show natural fabric folds and lighting consistency, without visible pixelation, texture repetition, or unnatural stiffness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white chiton in Image B exhibits natural fabric folds and the draping appears plausible as it flows elegantly with her movements. The lighting complements the gold accents, suggesting a realistic rendering of fabric with no apparent pixelation or repetition, making it consistent and fluid with natural stiffness.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the classical Greek-style waves and laurel leaves in the woman's hair consistent in shape, density, and lighting with the surrounding environment, and do they avoid unnatural clumping or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman’s hair in Image B is adorned with classical Greek-style waves and laurel leaves that appear natural, following consistent shapes and density appropriate in context with the classical theme. The lighting and density blend within the environment's golden hue, showing no signs of unnatural clumping or floating.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trees and animals in the background retain recognizable forms while being rendered in a golden, stylized manner consistent with classical Greek pottery art, without distorted proportions or fragmented geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees and animals in the background maintain recognizable forms and proportions. They are rendered in a golden hue that is stylized to reflect classical Greek pottery art without any distortion or fragmentation in their geometry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky rendered with coherent cloud formations and directional lighting that matches the overall illumination of the scene, avoiding artificial seams or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B shows coherent cloud formations that align smoothly with the scene's lighting, enhancing the classical theme. The lighting direction is consistent with the overall illumination, maintaining a seamless transition and uniform shading throughout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the woman’s hands and feet anatomically correct, with five fingers per hand and natural joint positioning, and does her posture reflect plausible human motion without deformation or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B has anatomically correct hands and feet, with five fingers on each hand and natural joint positioning. Her dynamic posture reflects graceful human motion, coherent with her dance position, avoiding any deformation or unnatural stretching.",
