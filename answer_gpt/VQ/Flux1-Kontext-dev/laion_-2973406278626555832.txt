    "Question": "Q1: Does the laboratory background in Panel 1 have consistent lighting and depth alignment with the foreground figure, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",
    "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the background is an illustrated blue color with black lines and comic-style text. There is no detailed laboratory scene shown, which aligns with a stylized comic aesthetic. In contrast, a real laboratory would need accurate lighting and depth between elements. Hence, applying world knowledge about comic illustrations, they naturally feature simpler, less realistic backgrounds than photographs.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the vape device held in the hand at a natural angle and proportion, with no stretching, compression, or misalignment of fingers around it?",
    "explanation": "In Panel 1 of the edited image, the vape device appears to be illustrated and depicted at a natural angle, with fingers realistically wrapped around it consistent with normally holding an object. World knowledge about the human hand grip and stylized comic illustrations supports this assessment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the vape device in Panel 1 show clear glass transparency, smooth surface reflections, and accurate labeling without pixelation, blurring, or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "The vape device is stylized in the illustration with simple lines and colors, rather than photographic realism, which does not naturally allow for realistic transparency or refined reflective surface outcomes expected in a photo. The labeling is stylized and unclear, consistent with a comic style. Typical comic designs do not employ detailed highlighting or realistic transparency.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the internal components in Panel 2 shown with correct relative sizes and connections, such as the coil being positioned above the liquid and the airflow path following a continuous route without broken lines or impossible geometry?",
    "explanation": "Panel 2 depicts the device's internal components with clear labeling and a stylized schematic. The coil is placed above the liquid, and the airflow path is continuous. Relative proportions appear accurate for a schematic illustration, ensuring logical positions and paths according to basic engineering principles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the text bubbles and labels in both panels avoid overlapping critical facial or clothing features, and are they aligned with natural reading direction without clipping or misplacement?",
    "explanation": "In both panels of Image B, text bubbles are strategically placed to ensure they do not interfere with key character elements like faces or clothing details. Text alignment follows conventional left-to-right reading patterns typical of comic illustrations, suitable and clear from a reader's perspective.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the hand holding the vape device have exactly five fingers with natural joint bends and no visible deformities, such as fused or elongated fingers?",
    "explanation": "In Panel 1, the hand illustrated holding the vape is typical of comic art with fingers clearly defined, totaling five in a natural pose. The portrayal respects anatomical correctness typical of basic comic representations, ensuring no visible deformities.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a clean boundary between the photographic figure and the illustrated panels, with no visible seams, double outlines, or color mismatches along the edges?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the transition between photographic and illustrated elements is clear, as each panel stands distinct in style. Comic panels use bold lines making borders distinct, and typical stylistic differences are intentional, contributing to a clear boundary between styles without visible mismatch or unintended seams.",
    "answer": "Yes"
