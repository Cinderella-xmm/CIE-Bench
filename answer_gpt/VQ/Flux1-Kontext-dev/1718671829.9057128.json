      "question": "Are the wooden beams and roof supports rendered as consistent geometric shapes with sharp, clean edges and no warped or fractured sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden beams and roof supports are depicted as stylized designs that maintain geometric consistency. This is demonstrated through the sharp angles and clean lines that align with common decorative elements seen in artistic renderings, such as bold framing and simplified representations of architectural features without distortion.",

      "question": "Is the moon a perfectly round shape with a smooth surface and uniform glow around its edge, without jagged outlines or uneven brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the moon as a stylized celestial object with rounded edges and consistent brightness, typical in graphic art aimed to idealize natural elements. The visual cues of a smooth, circular shape reflect common artistic interpretation of the moon, where the intrinsic texture is minimized for clarity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the plants in the foreground and background arranged in symmetrical, repeating patterns without irregular spacing or fragmented shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates plants using a stylized approach that emphasizes symmetry and uniformity. This is indicated by the repeating patterns and consistent spacing, common in decorative designs where nature is rendered with an artificial order for aesthetic purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the wooden surfaces and glass panes display metallic gold and silver accents with consistent sheen and reflection, without color bleeding or missing texture details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden surfaces are characterized by stylized metallic accents of gold and silver within the framework. This is visible through consistent sheen and reflective properties, typical in graphic illustrations where decorative patterns align with the designed aesthetic, lacking any bleeding or texture loss.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the stylized clouds positioned above the horizon with smooth, flowing outlines and do the window frames show bold, angular lines that align with the architectural style without breaking the windowâ€™s structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts stylized clouds above the horizon line, characterized by smooth and flowing outlines which are common in graphic depictions to maintain visual continuity. Similarly, the window frames showcase bold and angular lines consistent with architectural design principles specific to the stylized genre without any structural breaks.",
