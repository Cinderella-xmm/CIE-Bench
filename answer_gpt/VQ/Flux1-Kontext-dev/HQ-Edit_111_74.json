        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold foil detailing on the kimono is observed to be smoothly integrated with the red fabric. The reflectivity appears coherent and consistent along the floral patterns, suggesting a craftsmanship that avoids abrupt texture shifts or mismatches between the kimono's materials. The design maintains visual harmony without visible disruptions, enhancing the garment's aesthetic elegance.",

      "question": "Are the iridescent highlights in the woman’s hair distributed along natural light paths and do they display smooth color gradients without fragmented or unrealistic chromatic aberrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the iridescent highlights follow expected paths influenced by natural light sources and exhibit smooth transitions between colors. The gradients appear natural, and there are no visible fragmented or unrealistic chromatic shifts, which suggests a realistic representation of light interacting with the hair fibers. This consistency brings a lifelike charm, enriching the overall image with a believable luminosity.",

      "question": "Do the stylized bamboo elements in the background maintain their vertical alignment and structural integrity, with soft watercolor textures applied evenly without breaking geometric forms or creating floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bamboo elements retain their vertical positioning, presenting a continuous structural integrity essential to bamboo stalks. The application of soft watercolor-like textures does not compromise the geometric precision of these vertical forms, indicating that the editing process preserved the bamboo's natural appearance without introducing disjointed or floating fragments.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floral-shaped writing spaces and embossed borders placed in non-intrusive areas of the image and do they show consistent depth cues such as subtle shadows and raised textures without appearing flat or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral-shaped writing spaces and embossed borders are positioned thoughtfully, ensuring that they do not intrude upon key elements of the composition. The choice of placement respects the balance of the image. The embossed areas demonstrate consistent depth cues through techniques like shadowing and gradient textures, which establish dimensionality and avoid flatness or misalignment.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the woman’s body proportionally consistent with natural human anatomy, with no elongated limbs, distorted facial features, or unnatural curvature in posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the woman with a keen attention to anatomical accuracy. The body proportions, including the limbs and posture, exhibit consistency with natural human form, without irregular extensions or distortions that defy typical human anatomy. This realism in proportion contributes to a balanced visual representation authentic to human posture and structure.",
