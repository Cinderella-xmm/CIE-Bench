      "question": "Does the transformed dress exhibit smooth, flowing fabric folds consistent with celestial robes, without visible pixelation, unnatural sheen, or disrupted geometric patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress worn by the figure exhibits smooth and flowing fabric folds, which are characteristic of celestial-themed or angelic robes. The texture appears consistent, lacking visible pixelation or disruptive patterns. The visual design suggests a sense of ethereal elegance commonly associated with such robes. Therefore, the fabric representations align with how celestial garments are typically depicted, reflecting a smooth and harmonious design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gold and silver filigree details aligned with the fabricâ€™s surface and lighting direction, showing no floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold and silver filigree details on the dress in Image B are well-integrated, following the contours of the fabric and aligning with the lighting in the scene. The filigree enhances the garment's opulence, without displaying misalignment or edges that appear to float above the fabric. This alignment with the surface and lighting direction is crucial to maintain visual cohesion and authenticity, and thus it is achieved here.",

      "question": "Do the clouds beneath the figure have volumetric form and gradient shading that match the perspective and scale of the scene, avoiding flat or cartoonish rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds beneath the figure possess a volumetric quality with gradient shading that suggests depth and dimension. The shading is consistent with the scene's lighting and perspective, contributing to a sense of realism and avoiding flat, cartoonish characteristics. This volumetric effect enhances the three-dimensional feel of the setting, aligning with how clouds would appear at the scale portrayed.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the starry night sky blended smoothly with dawn hues near the horizon, maintaining consistent illumination and avoiding abrupt color transitions or misplaced stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The starry night sky in Image B is smoothly blended with hues that transition into a dawn-like appearance near the horizon. The transition in illumination is consistent, with no abrupt shifts or mismatched stars that would disrupt the scene's harmony. This combination reflects the natural progression of colors one would expect in a sky transitioning from night to dawn, maintaining a cohesive and serene visual.",

      "question": "Do both hands show five distinct fingers with natural proportions and skin texture, and do the glowing wisps emerge from the palms without intersecting or distorting the hand structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands of the figure display five distinguishable fingers with natural proportions and realistic skin texture. The glowing wisps emanate from the palms and are rendered in a manner that does not interfere with or distort the hand structure. The depiction maintains anatomical accuracy and complements the mystical aura of the scene, enhancing the overall composition of the image.",
