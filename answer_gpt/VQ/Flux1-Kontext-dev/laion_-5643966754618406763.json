      "question": "Are the tread patterns on the tire surfaces preserved and reinterpreted as armored segments with no visible texture repetition or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tread patterns on the tire surfaces appear consistent and detailed, resembling armored segments without any obvious repetition or loss of detail. The analysis here involves visual examination of the texture on the tire surfaces. The tread patterns maintain their integrity with high-level detailing, suggesting a reimagined design that keeps the visual appeal intact.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic joints within the wheel openings align properly with the original rim shape and appear physically connected without gaps or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic joints within the wheel openings are visually consistent with the original rim, showing proper alignment. The structure appears connected physically without any detectable gaps or deformation, which can be seen through the continuous flow of metallic elements without breaks or misalignments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glowing mechanical eyes centered within the hub openings, emitting light consistently without haloing, pixelation, or unnatural brightness spillage onto adjacent surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing mechanical eyes are located centrally within the hub openings. The emitted light showcases consistent brightness, without noticeable distractions such as haloing, pixelation, or spillage, indicating a controlled application of lighting effects that enhances clarity and focuses directly on the intended feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the antennae attached to the upper portion of the tire stack with continuous, smooth geometry and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the antennae are attached seamlessly to the upper portion of the tire stack. The geometry of these structures is continuous and smooth, showing no signs of floating or disconnected segments. This can be inferred from the coherent flow of the antennae curves and the natural attachment at the designated points.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire structure composed of the tires forming a unified, balanced creature shape with no missing, duplicated, or incorrectly scaled parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tires form a coherent and balanced creature structure, with all parts in strategic positioning and alignment. There is no evidence of missing, duplicated, or erroneously scaled elements, as observed through the symmetrical placement of tires and the harmony among various components, contributing to a unified conceptual design.",
