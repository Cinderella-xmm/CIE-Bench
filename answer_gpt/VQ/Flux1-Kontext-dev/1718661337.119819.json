    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the brown leather trench coat have consistent texture and natural folds that align with human body contours, and are the brass gears and mechanical details integrated without disrupting the coat's structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining the brown leather trench coat in Image B, the texture appears smooth, with folds that follow typical human body contours. This consistency suggests high quality in design. The brass gears and mechanical details are seamlessly integrated into the coat, complementing rather than distorting the overall structure. This reflects a careful consideration in design, ensuring aesthetic and functional harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the chronometer held in the right hand proportionally sized relative to the hand, with realistic shadows and reflections, and does it maintain a natural grip without distorted fingers or misplaced joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chronometer is proportioned well relative to the hand, neither appearing too large nor too small. Shadows and reflections on the chronometer offer a sense of realism, capturing light naturally as it might in a physical setting. The grip on the chronometer shows fingers in realistic positions with no evidence of distortion, suggesting accurate hand anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the goggles positioned on the tricorne hat in a way that respects the hatâ€™s structure, with no floating parts, unnatural shadows, or clipping errors between the goggles and the hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The goggles on Image B are placed such that they adhere to the contours of the tricorne hat. There are no floating sections or shadows that appear out of place, and there is no clipping evidenced between the goggles and the hat. This indicates a well-rendered alignment, suggesting a considered design process respecting physical realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the airships and floating cities in the background appear at appropriate distances, with consistent lighting and atmospheric perspective, and do they not overlap or obscure the subject unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The airships and floating cities are positioned at a logical perspective distance in Image B, with lighting that matches the sunset environment. This gives a cohesive atmosphere and depth at various distances. Importantly, they do not overlap or intrude unnaturally on the subject (the figure with the coat), but are instead depicted with care for natural placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the leather coat, brass gears, and other materials free from unnatural repetition, blurring, or artificial edges, and do fine details such as stitching and rivets remain sharp and consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the leather coat retains a natural texture with no signs of repetition or blurring. The brass gears and other material elements, including fine details like stitching and rivets, are crisp and well-defined. This clarity and absence of artificial edges imply meticulous detailing and high fidelity within the composition.",
