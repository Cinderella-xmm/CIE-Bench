      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the muscles and body proportions of the basketball player appear exaggerated but still maintain anatomical plausibility without unnatural bulges or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the muscles of the basketball player are shown with exaggerated definition, like vibrant colors, which is typical for graphic edits intending to emphasize athleticism. Despite the exaggeration, the muscles still conform to anatomical plausibility as there are no unnatural bulges or distortions such as discontinuities in muscle structure that would indicate broken geometry or an unrealistic portrayal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors applied to the player's clothing and skin consistent with the graffiti theme and do they retain visible texture and material properties without appearing flat or artificially oversaturated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors on the player's clothing and skin are vivid and brighter compared to the original image, aligning with the graffiti theme, which often utilizes bright colors and bold contrasts. Despite the increased color vibrancy, the textures and material properties are preserved as the clothing has visible characteristics like folds and the skin retains shading detail, avoiding a flat appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the basketball have exactly five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and does it grip the ball in a physically credible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the hand of the basketball player holding the ball has five fingers that follow a natural curve and spacing, matching anatomical expectations for hand shape and finger closure. The grip on the basketball appears physically credible, suggesting a firm hold without unusual angles or deformities.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blank graffiti-style text area clearly visible, stylistically consistent with the background graffiti, and placed in a way that does not distort the scene or obscure key elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination, Image B does not present a new blank graffiti-style text area distinct from Image A, where the graffiti theme already exists. The scene is consistent and does not introduce distortions or obscure key elements like the basketball hoop or player. Thus, the scene retains clarity and cohesiveness in its composition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the lighting, shadows, and surface textures of the player, basketball, and court consistent with each other and free from artifacts such as mismatched highlights or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is edited to enhance brightness and saturation, but the lighting still matches the style of the overall scene. Shadows and textures are consistent; for example, the player's shadow on the court aligns with the light source, and the textures of surfaces maintain clarity without visual artifacts like unmatched highlights or ghosting.",
