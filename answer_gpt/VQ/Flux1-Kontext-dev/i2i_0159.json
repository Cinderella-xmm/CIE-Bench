      "question": "Does the flying disc look natural in size and shape compared to the original tennis ball, maintaining a realistic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the flying disc appears large and predominantly round, with consistent circular features typical of such an object. Compared to the original tennis ball, the size of a flying disc is expected to be larger and flat, fitting the standard proportions of such an object, which aligns well with its depiction here. Hence, the depiction of the flying disc maintains a realistic appearance in size and shape.",

      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or visible distortions in the blue bow tie collar that affect its natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue bow tie around the dog's neck in the edited image appears well-defined, with distinct edges and a smooth texture that one would expect from a fabric bow tie. There are no visible distortions or inconsistencies in the texture that would suggest an unnatural appearance. The color is even, and the bow conforms to a realistic depiction of such an accessory.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the flying disc blend correctly into the environment regarding shadow and lighting, avoiding any artificial appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Though the flying disc is visible and appears in the intended position of motion, it lacks appropriate shadows and lighting effects that would integrate it seamlessly with the environment. The absence of these effects causes the disc to stand out slightly, giving it a somewhat unrealistic, artificial appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the blue bow tie collar fit naturally around the dogâ€™s neck without causing any distortion to the dog's anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue bow tie collar is depicted in a manner that aligns well with the curvature and shape of the dog's neck. The accessory fits snugly without apparent strain or distortion to the dog's form, suggesting a natural fit that supports realistic anatomy.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition of the image remain visually coherent, with the new elements fitting seamlessly into the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Overall, the addition of the bow tie is well-integrated and fits naturally with the dog's form, while the flying disc, despite its correct proportions, does not blend as well due to lighting and shadow inconsistencies. This affects the seamless integration of the new elements into the scene, leading to a slightly disjointed appearance.",
