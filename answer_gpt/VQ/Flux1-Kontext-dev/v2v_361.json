      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain of the dog appear naturally integrated into the image without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style keychain is held within a hand, and it appears cartoonish with smooth lines and flat colors. These design elements are typical for chibi-style art, contributing to its intended aesthetic without showing any visible editing artifacts or textures that seem out of place. The keychain fits naturally into the hand, suggesting an integration that is typical for such illustrative styles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi-style keychain consistent with the hand holding it, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the keychain match well with the hand size, looking plausible and consistent without any evident distortions. The small scale of chibi figures aligns with typical keychain dimensions, ensuring that the proportions are rational and not deformed.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain accurately depict the dog's essential features and characteristics from the original image, maintaining visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the dog has long, flowing fur and distinct features. In Image B, the keychain captures the essential elements such as fur style and general shape that resemble the dog from Image A. Despite its simplified form, the chibi style effectively represents these features in a credible manner, maintaining the dog's identity.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the texture and fine details of the chibi-style keychain preserved and look natural, without any loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi-style artworks typically utilize flat colors and smooth lines rather than detailed textures. In Image B, the chibi-style keychain aligns with these conventions, which are characteristic of this art style. The texture appears intentional and natural within its illustrative context, supporting its coherent representation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the connection between the chibi-style keychain and the tiny silver keyring appear natural and physically plausible, without any structural inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain is attached to a silver keyring. This attachment is visually coherent, mirroring real-world keychains where a ring is used to connect to the figurine. It appears structurally sound and plausible, matching common keyring designs.",
