    "Question": "Q1: Are all LEGO bricks forming the bed frame, mattress, and base properly aligned and interlocked without visible gaps or misalignments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks used for the bed, mattress, and base appear well-aligned and interlocked. The LEGO-style design is known for precision and tight fitting to ensure stability. Observing the clear image, one can see that all bricks line up neatly with no significant gaps or misalignments, suggesting that they are assembled correctly according to the LEGO design standards.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the light blue floral pattern on the duvet appear consistent with the original design, with no missing or incorrectly placed colored bricks?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, we observe a floral pattern on the duvet made of colored markings, not individual LEGO bricks. This pattern remains consistent with the original design from Image A in terms of style and placement. However, the design is transferred from an actual patterned fabric to a LEGO interpretation where the patterns are printed rather than made of LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the curved shape of the new headboard composed of LEGO-style elements that follow realistic LEGO curvature without appearing stretched or deformed?",
    "explanation": "The headboard in Image B is made using rounded LEGO bricks and pieces that create a smooth curve, which is consistent with realistic LEGO construction practices. The headboard's curve follows the typical dimensions and design philosophy of LEGO components, ensuring no stretching or deformation beyond what LEGO pieces normally allow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the pillows formed by stacked LEGO bricks showing a natural three-dimensional shape with appropriate layering and no floating or disconnected pieces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pillows are constructed from stacked LEGO bricks. They exhibit a three-dimensional shape similar to real pillows, with layers that imitate softness. There are no floating LEGO pieces or visible disconnections, reflecting well-executed building techniques suited to LEGO construction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the shadows cast by the LEGO bed match the lighting direction and softness of the original image, with no unnatural dark spots or over-bright areas?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows shadows that are consistent with the lighting seen in Image A. The soft lighting direction is maintained, and shadows appear natural, following the contours of the LEGO bed without harsh contrasts or unrealistic bright spots. This consistency ensures the shadows are aligned with the overall ambient light and direction shown in the original photo.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the proportions and positions of the pillows, duvet, and headboard consistent with the original bed, with no noticeable scaling errors or misplaced elements?",
    "explanation": "Upon comparison, Image B maintains proportional consistency of pillows, duvet, and headboard with those seen in Image A. The arrangement and sizes are highly similar to the original, ensuring no significant scaling errors or misplacement of elements, providing a faithful LEGO interpretation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do all LEGO bricks have a uniform matte finish with no unnatural glossiness, transparency, or pixelation that would suggest low-quality rendering?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO bricks in Image B exhibit a consistent matte finish typical of physical LEGO pieces. There is no visible glossiness or transparency that would indicate rendering anomalies or pixelation, supporting a high-quality digital representation of LEGO elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
