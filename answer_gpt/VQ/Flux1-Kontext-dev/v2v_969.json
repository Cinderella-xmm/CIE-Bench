      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D figures inside the snow globe maintain the correct proportions and avoid unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individuals and objects within appear as natural representations, in correct proportion to each other and the surrounding environment. The figures inside the snow globe are depicted in a realistic manner, matching the scale and positioning expected for such a setting, contrasting against the typically exaggerated features of chibi-style figures. This helps in maintaining the overall naturalness and proportions, without displaying any geometric distortion.",

      "question": "Does the light layer of snow on the grass inside the snow globe appear natural without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually shows a smoothly integrated field with a natural and consistent texture, lacking any visual indicators of snow, such as whiteness or texture variance. Since there is no apparent snow layer depicted, the question of any artifacts or unnatural textures from snow does not arise, maintaining continuity and realism.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the snow globe rest naturally on the rustic wooden shelf with soft sunlight filtering through, creating believable warm, golden reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe is visibly resting on a wooden shelf. The depiction includes warm, soft lighting that interacts with the globe and shelf, creating natural reflections and shadows. The lighting and reflections appear internally consistent and realistic with the scene around, indicating a believable interplay between sunlight and the objects on the shelf.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bats propped against the fence inside the snow globe depicted with natural textures and shapes, avoiding any distortion or unnatural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, no bats are visually identified against a fence, as the scene depicts baseball bats held by players in their hands. These bats exhibit realistic shapes and textures, showing no signs of distortion or irregularities. Their depiction within the context appears authentic and natural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition between the interior scene of the snow globe and the vintage baseball clubhouse backdrop smooth, without any visible artifacts or breaks in continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a consistent and smooth transition between the interior of the snow globe and the surrounding scene. The backdrop behind the globe aligns seamlessly with the scene depiction, without visible artifacts or abrupt discontinuities that could disrupt the transition. This helps maintain the illusion and coherence in the scene.",
