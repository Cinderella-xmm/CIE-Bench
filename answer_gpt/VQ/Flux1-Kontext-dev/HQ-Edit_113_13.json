      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the leaf crown on the fox’s head have natural leaf shapes, consistent texture, and proper alignment with the head without visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fox is depicted standing upright and wearing a leaf crown. The leaves in the crown exhibit shapes and textures typical of cartoon depictions, without visible seams or unnatural edges. The alignment with the fox's head appears appropriate given the stylized, cartoon nature of the imagery, which allows for more simplistic and exaggerated shapes. The overall integration into the character design looks intentional and consistent with the cartoon style. Thus, it reflects well on the thematic consistency and design coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fox’s hind legs properly aligned and proportioned when standing upright, with no distorted joints, unnatural curvature, or missing limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fox is cartoonishly standing upright, which means the typical real-world anatomy may be adapted for stylistic purposes. The hind legs are proportioned consistently with the rest of the body, indicating intentional design adhering to cartoon norms. The simplified limb design avoids complex joint articulation, presenting a smooth silhouette associated with animated characters rather than real animals. There are no missing or distorted parts, which suits the animated style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tree outlines in the background maintain clean, continuous lines without jagged edges, overlapping inconsistencies, or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in the background of Image B are constructed with clean, bold lines typical of cartoon artwork. The outlines are continuous and solid without visible jagged edges. The design maintains a flat, vibrant aesthetic, favoring simplicity and legibility over natural complexity, reflecting coherent animated style, free from inconsistencies or missing segments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pastel colors applied uniformly across the forest floor and foliage without creating unnatural color bleeding, pixelation, or loss of fine details like moss texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes a pastel color palette consistently applied throughout. The colors are uniform, with smooth transitions typical of cartoon aesthetics, avoiding detail complexity like moss textures. The result avoids pixelation or unnatural color bleeding, instead presenting a simplified graphic style. Given the cartoon constraints, the pastoral simplification fits within the design context.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the speech bubble positioned at a plausible distance from the fox, with correct shadowing and edge blending that matches the lighting and depth of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cartoon image B, the speech bubble is located at a visually appropriate distance from the fox, naturally integrated into the scene. The high-contrast colors and sharp edges typical of cartoons mean shadowing and edge blending are simplistic. The lighting and depth match the bold, flat composition style, facilitating easy readability. Within this context, the position appears intentional and coherent with the animated style.",
