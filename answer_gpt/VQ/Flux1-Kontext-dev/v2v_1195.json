      "question": "Does the skateboard maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility after being converted into a stained glass style, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard retains its recognizable shape and structure, as indicated by the preservation of its outline and basic form. The stained glass style adds artistic embellishments like stars and patterns, but these do not compromise the underlying shape of the skateboard. These enhancements are consistent with creative design elements found in stained glass art, which often include geometric shapes and vibrant color use. Therefore, the skateboard's transformation into stained glass style is credible, as it maintains its essential structure without introducing unnatural textures that obscure its identity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the kitchen sink and cabinets preserved without distortion, maintaining their physical rationality in the stained glass style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the stained glass effect applied to the scene, the geometric form and proportions of the kitchen sink and cabinets remain intact. The lines and angles are crisp, characteristic of stained glass artwork, yet they conform to the original shapes observed in realistic settings. This adherence to accurate geometric portrayals ensures that the physical rationality of these objects is maintained despite the stylized artistic transformation.",

      "question": "Does the stained glass effect applied to the countertop and backsplash tiles appear natural without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the countertop and backsplash are transformed into a stained glass style, which generally involves using bold outlines and vivid color segments. The tiles are clear and arranged in a structured way that resembles tiled masonry, which is typical for both standard and artistic tile representations. The texture remains cohesive with stained glass techniques, unlike real stone or ceramic textures. There are no visible defects that would suggest unnatural artifacts within this interpretation, suggesting the effect is applied smoothly and naturally.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the skateboard, sink, and cabinets visually credible and coherent, without any noticeable breaks or inconsistencies in the stained glass style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between all elements, including the skateboard, sink, and cabinets, appears smooth and cohesive, maintaining a consistent stained glass styling throughout. The stained glass effect unifies the entire composition, with consistent line work and color filling. Though the style is abstract, it is coherent, and there are no glaring breaks or inconsistencies that disrupt the visual flow between these components of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the details of the objects, such as the skateboard wheels and cabinet handles, remain authentic and detailed within the stained glass style, avoiding any degradation of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the abstract nature of the stained glass style transforms the scene, key details are highlighted rather than degraded. The skateboard wheels are outlined and colored distinctively, as are the cabinet handles, which are clearly defined with sharp lines standard to stained glass borders. These elements are sufficiently detailed within the context of the artistic style applied, ensuring no loss in recognition and maintaining a degree of authenticity relative to the original objects.",
