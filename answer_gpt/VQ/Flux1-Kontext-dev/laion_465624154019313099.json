      "question": "Are the eyes added to the cake positioned naturally on the surface without distorting the shape or texture of the meringue domes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are integrated into the cake's surface. The eye positioning respects the structural outline of the cake, fitting seamlessly without altering the domes' original contours. The artistic representation ensures that the presence of eyes does not visibly compromise or deviate from the characteristic round shape of the meringue domes, which suggests careful placement respecting natural features.",

      "question": "Do the strawberries retain their original shape and size when repurposed as a hat, without any visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visually, the strawberry used as a hat in Image B matches the typical size and shape of the real strawberries observed in Image A. There is no apparent distortion or stretching in the strawberry's design in Image B, which implies that the original characteristics were maintained for consistency and recognizability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the faint silhouettes of utensils in the background visually consistent with the lighting and depth of the scene, without introducing harsh edges or unnatural shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouettes of utensils are not directly visible as a distinct background element. Instead, audience hands and generic shapes form the backdrop, which is smooth and consistent with the cartoon style without any harsh edges or shadows. This maintains a visual harmony with the overall artistic depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the strawberries and garnishes arranged around the cake in a way that maintains structural balance and does not overlap or distort the cake’s base or side layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the strawberries and accompanying decorative elements surrounding the cake are thoughtfully arranged. They complement the visual balance of the cake's sculpture and do not intrude on or disrupt the foundational or side layers of the cake. This careful attention to placement supports both visual appeal and design integrity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the depiction of the cake shaking its head maintain the rigidity of the cake’s structure without suggesting unnatural flexing or bending of the layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake character is illustrated with a dynamic pose due to its anthropomorphized features. However, within this cartoon context, the structural rigidity of the cake's depiction is maintained in an animated style that inherently allows for such expressions. The integrity of the internal layers remains consistent as part of the character's portrayal.",
