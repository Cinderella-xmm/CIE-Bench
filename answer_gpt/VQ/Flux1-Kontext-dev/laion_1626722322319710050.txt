    "Question": "Q2: Are the leaves of the miniature trees semi-transparent, allowing light to pass through them, and positioned at a distance from the statue that matches their reduced scale without overlapping the figure unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature trees inside the glass dome seem to have leaves that are semi-transparent, as suggested by the way they interact with light in the image. They are positioned at a distance from the statue that seems proportionate to their scale, not overlapping the figure unnaturally. This creates a realistic miniature environment, which is often desired in such presentations.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the dome stand feature a polished stone surface with subtle texture variation, and are the vine patterns clearly defined, following natural growth patterns without breaking or repeating unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the dome stand with a polished stone surface, exhibiting subtle texture variations typical of stone. The vine patterns are clearly defined and appear to follow a natural growth pattern without any breaks or unnatural repetitions, which suggests meticulous crafting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the glass dome positioned above the statue and base without clipping through any part of the figure or pedestal, and does it rest securely on the dome stand without floating or tilting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome is positioned perfectly above the statue and base. It does not clip through any parts of the figure or pedestal and seems to rest securely on the dome stand. There is no evidence of it floating or tilting, indicating a proper alignment and support structure.",
