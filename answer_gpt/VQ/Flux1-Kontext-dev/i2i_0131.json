        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B casts an even brightness across both refrigerators, which indicates the use of consistent ambient lighting typical in indoor settings.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the refrigerators integrated seamlessly within the cabinetry, creating a smooth visual transition. The top part of the refrigerators aligns neatly with the cabinet structure above, and the sides blend without harsh lines or noticeable seams that could disrupt the flow and continuity typical in modern kitchen environments. This integration supports the aesthetic goal of a streamlined kitchen design.",
