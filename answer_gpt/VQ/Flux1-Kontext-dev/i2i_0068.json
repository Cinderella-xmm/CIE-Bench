      "question": "Does the doll figure and wooden stump appear as a cohesive oil painting with visible canvas texture, without introducing any unnaturally hard edges or overly pixelated areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows that the overall appearance of the image has been transformed into an oil painting style. The doll figure and wooden stump exhibit a cohesive look with smooth transitions and visible brush strokes that resemble a canvas texture, typical in oil paintings. There are no unnatural hard edges or pixelated areas that stand out. This suggests a successful conversion to a painted style without compromising the visual flow or introducing any disruptive elements.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the doll figure and wooden stump preserved accurately after being converted into an oil painting, maintaining structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the oil painting effect applied, the proportions and shapes of the doll figure and the wooden stump appear well-preserved. The structural coherence is maintained as the elements still resemble their original forms without distortion or alteration. This indicates careful attention to detail during the conversion to ensure all elements retain their authentic appearance despite the stylistic change.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition between the oil painting-style artwork of the doll figure and wooden stump and the unedited parts of the image smooth, avoiding visible lines or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observation of Image B suggests an overall application of oil painting style across the entire image, which means there is no separate transition between edited and unedited parts. Since the entire scene appears to be treated uniformly, there are no discernible lines or artifacts indicating an inconsistent transition, creating a harmonious composition.",

      "question": "Does the warm color palette used in the oil painting-style artwork blend naturally with the surrounding environment, avoiding any jarring contrasts or artificial hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B shows warm tones typical of oil painting, which complements the natural colors found in the scene, such as those behind the counter and decorations. The colors blend harmoniously without creating contrast or introducing artificial hues that appear out of place. This coherent color choice contributes to a unified visual aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement of the oil painting-style artwork of the doll figure and wooden stump fit logically within the context of the image, enhancing rather than disrupting the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the doll figure and wooden stump retain their logical placement, fitting seamlessly into the context of the busy, cozy cafe or shop setting. The added texture and style enhance the scene by contributing to its warmth and artistic charm without disrupting the viewer's understanding or experience of the setting.",
