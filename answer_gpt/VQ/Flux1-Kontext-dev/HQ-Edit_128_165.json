    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the bell-shaped body of the jellyfish have a consistent translucent appearance with no sharp edges, visible seams, or unnatural texture patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jellyfish's bell-shaped body shows a consistent translucent appearance, typical for many jellyfish species, which generally have smooth and uniform surfaces. There are no visible seams, unnatural texture patches, or sharp edges on the jellyfish, which is aligned with the common understanding of jellyfish biology.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tendrils extending from the jellyfish's body smooth, curved, and iridescent, with no angular distortions or segmented appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features tendrils that extend from the jellyfish in smooth, flowing curves. The iridescent quality is consistent with many marine organisms' lighting effects, and there are no angular distortions or segments visible, which aligns with the expected appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the internal glowing patterns within the jellyfish's bell appear as natural, swirling bioluminescent designs without repeating geometric shapes or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jellyfish's bell exhibits glowing patterns, typical of bioluminescence seen in marine environments. However, the patterns consist of clear geometric shapes. These are not naturally occurring in jellyfish designs, which would likely feature more organic, swirling bioluminosity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing nodules along the tendrils softly illuminated with gradual light spread and positioned in a natural, non-uniform but plausible arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nodules on the tendrils in Image B exhibit soft illumination and gradual light spread, which are characteristics of natural bioluminescent features. Their positioning appears non-uniform, which is plausible and typical for such features in nature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ambient lighting in the scene diffused and tinted with blue-green hues, and are there faint water particles or depth cues visible around the jellyfish, consistent with an underwater environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B conveys an underwater ambience with diffused lighting tinted in blue-green hues, typical of ocean environments. The presence of faint water particles and depth cues supports the underwater setting, making the scene consistent with common depictions of jellyfish in such surroundings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the connection point between the jellyfish and the ceiling smooth and continuous, with no floating segments or abrupt breaks in structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting does not include a ceiling as it depicts an underwater scene. The jellyfish does not connect to any ceiling, hence there is no question of a smooth connection point to an architectural structure that would feature in an interior environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
