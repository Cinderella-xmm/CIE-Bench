      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the stained glass wings feature consistent, smooth patterns without jagged edges or pixelated textures, and do they appear to transmit light naturally as if made of glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained glass wings are depicted with smooth, delicate patterns resembling the natural veins of a leaf. The light transmission is consistent with how glass would allow light to pass through, providing a translucent effect that implies a glass-like material. The textures are smooth and free from jagged edges, which aligns with how stained glass appears in real life.",

      "question": "Is the dress composed of leaf-like and vine-like elements that maintain natural curvature, shading, and thickness, with no visible seams or synthetic textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dress designed with leaf-like and vine patterns. The elements are rendered with natural curvature and shading, giving the appearance of a dress crafted from natural materials rather than synthetic. The dress blends seamlessly without visible seams and maintains an organic texture throughout, resembling a garment made from real leaves.",

      "question": "Are the glowing mushrooms and twinkling fireflies integrated into the background with consistent lighting and depth, avoiding floating or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing mushrooms and twinkling fireflies are positioned within the scene's depth and are consistent with the surrounding lighting. The glow effects enhance the magical ambiance, and the fireflies appear to hover naturally, integrated well into the forest environment. There is no floating or misplacement that detracts from the visual consistency.",

      "question": "Do both hands show five fingers each with natural joint alignment, smooth skin texture, and no distortion or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An analysis of Image B reveals that both hands have five fingers each, with natural joint alignment and smooth skin texture. The position of the fingers appears natural and lacks any distortions or additional digits, considering what is typical for human anatomy.",

      "question": "Are the legs positioned in a physically plausible seated posture with natural knee and ankle angles, and no elongation or compression of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs are crossed in a seated posture, displaying natural knee and ankle angles one would expect in a sitting position. There is no visible elongation or compression of the limbs, ensuring the posture is physically plausible and aligned with human anatomy norms.",
