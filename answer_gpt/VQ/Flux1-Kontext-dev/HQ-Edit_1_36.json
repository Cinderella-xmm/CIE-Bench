    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and skin texture on the elderâ€™s face naturally rendered without excessive smoothing or artificial cartoon-like distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, this question is not applicable as the face is deliberately blurred, making it impossible to assess the naturalness of wrinkles or skin texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Not applicable",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the floral patterns on the hanbok and surrounding foliage display consistent detail and alignment without visible repetition or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows floral patterns on the hanbok that appear finely detailed and aligned, consistent with realistic patterning. The foliage around the subject also appears naturally detailed without evidence of pattern repetition or blurring, suggesting a coherent and realistic rendering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gradient transition across the hanbok's fabric smooth and continuous, with no sharp color breaks or unnatural banding effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hanbok showcases a gradient transition in the fabric that appears smooth and continuous. The colors blend well without unrealistic sharp breaks or noticeable banding, implying a natural color flow.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the green vine accents positioned behind the subject and aligned with the depth of the background, without appearing to float above or through solid structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green vine accents are placed around the subject within the card frame rather than within the background. However, they align visually with the card design rather than conflicting with any perceived depth or floating over solid structures, maintaining visual coherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the envelope frame fully aligned with the image boundaries, with no jagged edges, clipping errors, or mismatched shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the envelope frame is well-aligned with the photo layout, displaying smooth edges and proper shadowing without clipping errors or visible mismatches, maintaining a professional and seamless appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays sharp and clearly defined edges on the hair, fabric folds, and floral elements. There are no signs of jagged lines, pixelation, or ghosting artifacts, suggesting high-quality rendering of these elements.",
