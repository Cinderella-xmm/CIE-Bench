      "question": "Do the simplified versions of the red motorcycle and blue truck maintain their key features without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle and truck have been transformed into a more simplified, cartoon-like style. The red motorcycle retains its sleek, aerodynamic shape, and the blue truck keeps its traditional, boxy appearance. This simplification successfully conveys the essence of the objects without adding any distorted or unnatural textures. This transformation involves changing details into bold lines and flat colors, which is typical for such illustrations, retaining the identity of the objects clearly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the rider's black gear retain its essential characteristics without unnatural alterations or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the riderâ€™s black gear has been simplified to match a cartoon style. The essential characteristics are maintained, as the rider still appears to be equipped with a helmet and black gear typical for a motorcyclist. The use of solid black color and bold lines achieves the desired cartoon effect without introducing distortions or taking away from what that attire represents.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the playful touches such as exaggerated proportions or expressive characteristics added without breaking the visual credibility or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits some playful exaggeration typical of a cartoon style, such as slightly enlarged motorcycle front and the truck's rounded features. These elements are well-integrated into the overall design without introducing graphical artifacts or breaking visual credibility in the context of a cartoon. Exaggeration is a common cartoon technique to add personality, which is done effectively here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the thick white outline applied consistently around the sticker design without interfering with the clarity of the elements within?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The thick white outline around the key elements in Image B is consistent and does not interfere with the clarity within. This is a common technique in sticker designs to help separate elements from the background and provide distinct edges. The outline is applied uniformly around both the motorcycle and the truck, enhancing clarity and definition against the black gradient circle.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the use of a solid flat color for the circular base, with the motorcycle or truck extending beyond it, achieve a dynamic effect without causing visual inconsistencies or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular base in Image B, achieved using a black gradient into white, helps to focus attention on the motorcycle and truck. These elements extend past the circle, giving a sense of movement and dynamism, which is coherent with the rest of the design. This approach balances dynamic effect without inducing visual inconsistencies or omitting important detail given the context of simplification in the cartoon style.",
