      "question": "Does the kite maintain its geometric shape without any distortion or damage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite maintains the same diamond shape with clearly defined edges and no visible signs of distortions or damage. This visual cue suggests the structural integrity of the kite is preserved, which aligns with our understanding of what an intact kite should look like. Analysis involves confirming the kite shape is consistent with expectations for geometric forms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures on the kite that do not align with the expected paper material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a photograph of the kite, and the kite appears to exhibit the typical texture associated with paper material. Considering the kite's expected material, no textures are visually evident that would indicate anything contrary to a paper-like surface. The analysis involves assessing whether the visual texture matches commonly understood properties of paper.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the yellow color of the kite consistent and natural against the sky backdrop, without any unnatural color variance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow of the kite is vibrant and consistent without any irregularities or color variance that might suggest an unnatural appearance against the backdrop. The visual analysis here assures that the color consistency fits within a normal range expected for a paper kite in clear daylight, which informs the conclusion.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the kite's tail appear structurally coherent and smoothly connected to the kite body, without any visible breaks or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the kite's tail extending smoothly from the kite's body with no observable breaks or disruptions. This coherence suggests proper attachment and structure typical of kite designs, confirming that the tail is structurally sound. The assessment process involves confirming these observations align with commonly expected kite design features.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the kite string depicted naturally, free from any artifacts or unrealistic thickness variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite string appears to be thin and delicate, consistent with what is usually expected of kite strings in reality. There are no visual artifacts or thickness variations that seem unnatural. The analysis consists of observing the string's appearance and ensuring it aligns with conventional expectations.",
