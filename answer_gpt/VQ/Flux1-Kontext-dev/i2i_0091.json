    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the integration of the castle hall elements into the room visually align with the existing lighting and shadows, avoiding unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast by the architectural elements, like the clock, doors, and windows, are consistent with the direction and quality of the ambient lighting that comes from the window. This aligns with how such elements would naturally behave in similar lighting conditions. Furthermore, the shadows have soft edges and follow a logical path across the surfaces they interact with, similar to how natural lighting would operate in a castle setting without producing noticeable artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the materials of the newly added castle hall elements, like stone and metal, depicted naturally and free from obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image features elements like stone walls and wooden doors, which have textures and reflections consistent with natural stone and wood materials. The stone walls are uniform, with shading and textural detail that mimic realistic stonework. The wooden doors, too, reflect coherent grain patterns typical to wood, free from digital artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the books, vases, and plants remained undistorted and preserved their original details post-editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This question assumes a comparison between the original interior elements like books, vases, and plants in Image A with any potential changes in Image B. However, since Image B focuses on an entirely different setting and these items are thus not present for comparison in Image B, they do not seem to be impacted. Therefore, the answer is naturally skewed to 'No' as these elements do not appear in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the introduction of the castle hall maintain the room's spatial rationality, keeping the proportions and placements of objects consistent with expectations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, spatial elements such as doors, the clock, and windows appear proportionate to typical real-world physical dimensions, which are consistent with expectations for rooms of such architectural style. The large wooden doors and clock are well-aligned with those expectations for either a hallway or portico space in a castle or similarly styled building.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting effects in the edited castle hall scene match the light source and style of the original room, ensuring continuity in illumination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B matches the castle hall's theme, with the light entering from the window casting consistent and directional shadows matching the time of day implied by the ambient light. This consistency shows that the illumination approach applied aligns with a singular light source from the window, similar to expectations of typical interior lighting behavior.",
