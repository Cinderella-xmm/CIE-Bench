      "question": "Does the facade of the theater building appear composed of uniform tan LEGO bricks with brown accents, without visible seams, irregular patterns, or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facade appears clearly made from LEGO bricks, which are uniform and consistent in texture, rendering the building's surface into distinct brick-like patterns typical for LEGO construction. The tan color is consistent with LEGO's palette, and brown accents are uniformly integrated, giving a cohesive LEGO-like appearance without irregular patterns or visible seams. On analyzing the same aspect in Image A, it's evident that Image A portrays a real-world building with realistic textures such as uneven stucco walls, unlike the smooth LEGO texture seen in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the three large arched windows replaced with translucent square LEGO-style panes that preserve the arch shape but feature a regular grid pattern, without distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three large windows are depicted with a clear, regular grid pattern characteristic of LEGO windows, maintaining the arch shape, demonstrating a consistent and aligned design typical of LEGO pieces. There is no distortion or misalignment visible. When comparing with Image A, the windows feature actual glass panels with realistic reflections and slight distortions, contrasting the structured and undistorted LEGO grid pattern in Image B.",

      "question": "Do the \"Walgreens\" and \"Marina Theater\" signs show letters constructed from smooth red flat LEGO bricks, maintaining legibility and alignment with the awning structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the signs above the building entrances are constructed using LEGO bricks, showing smooth red flat plates forming the text. The letters are designed to be straightforward and legible, matching the awning's structure perfectly. In Image A, the signs utilize typical real-world fonts and hanging mechanisms, which contrast with the flat-brick LEGO design in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both vintage cars rendered as blocky LEGO vehicles with simplified shapes, including rectangular bodies, circular wheels, and flat surfaces, without retaining realistic car features like curved fenders or chrome trim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the cars as LEGO vehicles, clearly visible with simplified, blocky designs typical of LEGO toys. These include rectangular bodies, circular LEGO wheels, and flat surfaces devoid of realistic features like curves, intricate fenders, or chrome trim found in real cars. When comparing to Image A, the cars in Image A display realistic vintage styles, complete with curves and detailed metalwork, showing the contrast between realistic images and the simplified LEGO style in Image B.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the LEGO-style cars and building maintain proper scale and alignment with each other and the surrounding environment, with no floating parts, misaligned bricks, or unnatural spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall scene maintains coherence in scale, with cars fitting naturally on the street alongside the building without any obvious alignment issues, floating elements, or awkward spacing. This creates an impression of a properly built LEGO set. In contrast, Image A displays real-world architecture and cars, where scale depends on actual proportions, but the alignment and natural positioning are correct. Both images show consistency within their respective styles, but Image B adheres well to its LEGO presentation.",
