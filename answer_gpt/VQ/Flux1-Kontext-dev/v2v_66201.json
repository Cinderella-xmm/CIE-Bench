      "question": "Does the transition between the Victorian attire and the cosmic dust appear seamless without introducing unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cosmic background is characterized by stars and a spiral galaxy, which smoothly transitions into the setting. The attire of the monkey-like figure, with its clear Victorian design, does not show any visual discrepancies where it meets the background. The attire seems to sit naturally against the cosmic backdrop without introducing textures or visual artifacts suggesting an artificial merger. This seamlessness is achieved by ensuring consistent lighting and shadow, commonly seen in digital art conveying a surreal environment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the clockwork tendrils growing from the brass scientific instrument visually plausible and free from unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, brass tendrils emerge from the scientific instrument, extending into various parts of the image. The tendrils are depicted with smooth, curving lines and maintain a consistent brass texture. They do not display warping or unnatural bends, suggesting deliberate design rather than distortion. These elements are integrated into the scene in a cohesive manner, aligning with the brass hue of the instrument and maintaining visual plausibility as a part of the surreal depiction.",

      "question": "Do the monkey's hands, while subtly distorted, still maintain a natural appearance and structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monkey-like figure's hands are placed on the table, interacting with the brass scientific instrument. The hands exhibit a slight exaggerated realism, characteristic of surreal art, yet they retain the essential anatomical structure found in primate hands. The fingers are proportionately long and resting naturally, showing structural consistency with expected hand anatomy, even though there is a subtle stylistic distortion.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the image evoke a dreamlike state characteristic of Surrealism while maintaining visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases several elements typical of Surrealism, such as the cosmic background, the Victorian attire, and the tendril-like extensions from the instrument. These elements are combined in a way that defies typical logic, creating a dreamlike atmosphere. Despite the fantastical setting, the attention to detail in texture, proportions, and harmony in the scene give the image visual credibility, making the surreal composition appear cohesive and intentional.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the transformations preserved the fine details and proportions of the original Victorian attire and brass scientific instrument?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the changes, such as the addition of tendrils, the Victorian attire retains its intricate detailing, like buttons and fabric texture, which are characteristic of the era. The brass scientific instrument continues to exhibit the same level of detailed craftsmanship and proportion that gives it a realistic appearance. These elements suggest that the transformations have been carefully applied, preserving the fidelity of the original elements' textures and proportions.",
