        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no apparent additions such as a LEGO minifigure or a pear-inspired animal design visible within the scene.

      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the LEGO minifigure and pear-inspired animal design logically consistent with the size and scale of the pear and smartphone in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any apparent LEGO minifigure or pear-inspired animal design. There are only a pear and a smartphone inside the glass enclosure. Therefore, there are no elements like a LEGO minifigure or pear-inspired design to evaluate for size and scale against the existing objects.",

      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the glass cube, matte black base, and nameplate retain their natural appearance and fine details without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts a glass cube enclosure with a matte black base and a nameplate. The glass appears clear and smooth with realistic reflections and refractions, the base showcases a matte texture consistent with a solid material, and the nameplate is well-defined with readable text. These elements all retain their natural appearance and fine details without any visible artifacts, indicating a high-quality and cohesive composition.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the placement of the LEGO minifigure, pear-inspired animal, and nameplate within the transparent glass cube create a visually coherent and plausible composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image displays a transparent glass cube containing a simple arrangement of a pear and a smartphone, with the nameplate affixed to the base. Since there are no additions of a LEGO minifigure or pear-inspired animal design, the composition focuses on these existing elements. Their placement is coherent and makes sense within the display, with the nameplate providing context. This setup maintains visual coherence and plausibility.",

      "question": "Does the lighting and background color transition from a soft caramel shade to a gentle cream tone enhance the natural appearance and authenticity of the wooden surface and other elements in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background and lighting in Image B transition smoothly from a soft caramel to a gentle cream, providing a warm and uniform glow. This choice of color palette complements the wooden surface, enhancing its natural wood grain texture and overall authenticity. Additionally, the even lighting accentuates the clarity of the glass and the details of the pear and smartphone without casting harsh shadows or unnatural highlights.",
