      "question": "Do the bold calligraphic outlines and flat planes of color on the dolls' clothing and hair maintain the original proportions and positions without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls' clothing and hair have been stylized to fit the Ukiyo-e style, characterized by bold outlines and flat planes of color. This artistic style is known for its simplicity and emphasis on outline over dimension. The proportions and positions of these elements appear consistent with the original design, maintaining harmony with the overall composition. Although the style transformation simplifies shading and detail, the core positioning and proportions are well-preserved, indicating no unnatural distortions are introduced.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the dolls' skin and hair free from unnatural artifacts and maintain a natural appearance after the style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the style transformation has aligned the skin and hair with the Ukiyo-e flatness, where texture is more implied than explicitly detailed. This involves reducing the detailed texture found in realistic depictions to smoother surfaces, which is typical for this artistic style. This transformation does not introduce unnatural artifacts; instead, it faithfully replicates expected stylistic features.",

      "question": "Do the dolls' limbs and facial features retain their structural integrity and do not appear deformed after the style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the dolls are depicted in a stylized manner consistent with Ukiyo-e art, attention has been paid to maintaining the structural integrity of their limbs and facial features. The transformation maintains the fundamentals of the original forms, ensuring that these features do not appear distorted or deformed despite the artistic abstraction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the subtly patterned, simplified background complement the dolls without disrupting the visual flow and maintaining the overall sense of reality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is simple and patterned, characteristics common to Ukiyo-e art. This style deliberately uses minimalistic backdrops that emphasize the foreground subjects. The background complements the dolls by providing a serene stage for them rather than acting as a focal point, thereby preserving the visual flow and underlying sense of reality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dolls' poses and expressions remain coherent with the original scene and contribute to the visual credibility of the Ukiyo-e style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls' poses are animated yet harmonious with their original context, suggesting motion and interaction typical of the activities depicted. This coherence is key to upholding visual credibility, as the Ukiyo-e style thrives on capturing essence over exact photorealism. The poses support the stylized interpretation without compromising the intended dynamics of the original scene.",
