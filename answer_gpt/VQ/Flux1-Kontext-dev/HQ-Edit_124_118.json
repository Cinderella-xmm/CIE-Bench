    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the waterfall in the center of the image appear as a coherent, transparent projection with smooth flow lines and consistent light interaction, without visible pixelation or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfall is shown with a luminescent or ethereal quality, indicating an artistic alteration from a natural view to resemble a glowing entity. The flow lines of water are smooth and maintain a consistent interaction with the light throughout the fall. There are no apparent pixelations or broken shapes, supporting the visual effect of a smooth, coherent water projection.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree trunks and vines in the foreground displaying iridescent fiber-optic-like strands that follow natural branch contours without breaking geometric continuity or exhibiting patchy, non-uniform glow patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree trunks and vines have been edited to emit a glow resembling fiber-optic strands, which enhances the mystical or otherworldly appearance. These glowing features contour naturally with the structure of the branches and vines, creating a uniform glow without interruptions or patchy inconsistencies.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vine formations in the foreground and along the riverbanks form continuous, self-supporting loops without floating disconnected segments or geometrically impossible bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vine formations appear to be continuous and integrated into the scene, forming natural loops or arcs that correspond to believable plant growth patterns. There are no visible disconnected or suspending segments, nor are there any bends that defy natural geometry.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background landscape (distant mountains and sky) visually consistent with the foreground projections, showing no abrupt transitions, mismatched lighting, or unnatural fog effects that suggest poor layer blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a background with a softly glowing or luminescent quality in both the mountains and the sky. The transitions between the foreground features and background scenery are smooth, with lighting that matches the ethereal theme of the entire image. There are no harsh or abrupt changes, nor is there any mismatched lighting or poorly blended fog effects.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the river stones, foliage, and moss-covered surfaces in the lower portion of the image sharp and detailed, without blurred edges or repeating pattern artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures of the river stones, foliage, and moss are crisp and well-defined. The details are clear without evidence of blur or repeating patterns that would indicate low-quality texture application or editing artifacts. The level of detail contributes to the overall realism even in an artistically altered image.",
