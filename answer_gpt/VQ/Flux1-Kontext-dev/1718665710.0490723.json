    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head proportionally enlarged without distorting facial features or flattening the curls of the hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head appears larger compared to a standard proportional ratio, characteristic of chibi style figures. This style usually involves exaggerated features such as large heads with often simplified but recognizable details (like curls in the hair) that don't appear flattened or distorted. This suggests careful design maintaining the stylistic integrity of a chibi figure.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black outlines uniformly thick and cleanly separated from internal details such as hair, skin, and armor engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outline of the figure is distinctly black and consistent in thickness, which is common in stylized representations like cartoon or chibi designs. These outlines help differentiate the elements such as hair and armor engravings from one another without bleed or merging, ensuring clarity and separation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the armor display consistent glossy reflections and smooth color transitions without pixelation or repeating patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the armor features smooth color transitions with glossy reflections, which are coherent with polished metal surfaces. The absence of pixelation and pattern repetition indicates high-quality rendering typical of digitally designed figures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shoulder pauldrons and chest plate clearly defined with intact edges and symmetrical design, free from geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoulder pauldrons and chest plate exhibit precise edges and a symmetrical design, characteristic of attention to detail in digital illustrations. There are no visible distortions in their form, indicating a well-executed design in terms of geometry.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the silver chain attached at a coherent point and composed of uniformly shaped links that appear physically connected to the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silver chain appears attached at the central point above the head with links that are uniformly shaped and realistically rendered, suggesting they connect logically and physically, enhancing the authenticity of a pendant design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the background exhibit a uniform dark texture with no bright reflections or unnatural gradients, consistent with velvet material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a dark, consistent shade without any reflections or gradients, resembling the characteristics of velvet material. This cohesion assures that the focus remains on the foreground figure without distraction.",
