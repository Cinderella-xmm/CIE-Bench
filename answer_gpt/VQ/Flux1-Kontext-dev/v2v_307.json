      "question": "Does the chibi-style representation of the bandage inside the packaging maintain structural coherence without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style representation of the bandage within the packaging is simplified and cartoonish, appropriate for the artistic style. The structure appears coherent as it maintains the recognizable elements of a bandage, such as the adhesive surface and the cushion pad, without introducing any textures or distortions that would appear unnatural within this context. The design choice aligns with the chibi art style, which often simplifies objects while retaining their essential features. There are no visual cues suggesting any disruption in structural coherence or introduction of unusual textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fabric texture and adhesive surface of the realistic bandage outside the packaging depicted with high detail and free from artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The realistic bandage outside the packaging shows a high level of detail, with clear representation of the fabric texture and adhesive surface. The image depicts the texture and color of the bandage distinctly, showing features like weave patterns and the fuzzy surface of the cushion pad which are characteristic of real bandages. There are no visible artifacts or distortions that would detract from the quality of this depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the packaging design, including the isometric perspective and the label \"HEALING ESSENTIALS,\" integrate naturally into the scene without disrupting visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging uses an isometric perspective that provides a three-dimensional view, which is commonly used in product displays for better visibility. The label \"HEALING ESSENTIALS\" is aligned and integrated well with the overall design, maintaining visual coherence. The colors and design elements are consistent, and nothing appears out of place. The perspective and packaging elements align logically as per the conventions of such product designs, maintaining visual credibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and placement of the chibi-style bandage within the packaging logically consistent with the realistic bandage outside, avoiding any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style bandage within the packaging is presented in a manner that is visually consistent with the real bandage outside. The dimensions and proportions fit well within the packaging, and it follows the cartoonish style without over-exaggerating beyond recognizable bandage structure. Both the chibi-style and realistic bandages maintain a size relationship that ensures consistent visual logic, avoiding any apparent distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the materials used for the packaging and the realistic bandage appear natural and consistent with their intended purpose, without any obvious unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The materials used for both the packaging and the realistic bandage appear to be depicted accurately and naturally. The packaging looks like a typical product box with a clear window for viewing the item inside, as expected in retail displays. The realistic bandage reflects the characteristics of actual bandage materials, such as the fabric texture and soft adhesive areas, without any visual artifacts that would imply artificiality. Overall, the materials correspond well with their intended purposes and are depicted consistently.",
