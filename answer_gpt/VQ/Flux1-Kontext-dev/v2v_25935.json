      "question": "Do the Lego bricks representing the cobblestone path maintain a natural appearance without introducing obvious unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cobblestone path in Image B is represented using Lego bricks. These bricks are systematically arranged to mimic the natural pattern of cobblestones. The consistent shape and uniform texture of Lego bricks may make them appear somewhat unnatural compared to real cobblestones; however, within the context of a diorama using Lego, this representation can be considered as maintaining a 'natural appearance' given the medium used. In the context of Lego styling, these textures are reasonable.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Lego brick structures of the buildings coherent and visually credible, without any broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings are constructed using Lego bricks which are designed to fit together in a coherent manner. The Lego brick structures appear solid and follow the expected geometric shapes of buildings, such as rectangular windows and doors, ensuring a credible representation within the Lego medium. The bricks are neatly stacked with no visible gaps or broken structures.",

      "question": "Does the man's figure in the Lego diorama retain proper proportions and physical rationality, avoiding unnatural body shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is represented as a figurine commonly seen in Lego sets. While Lego figures are stylized and come with more simplified proportions, this representation retains the essential body proportions and logical physical structure expected from a Lego figure. Although the proportions are not entirely realistic, they are consistent within the Lego aesthetic standards.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the man's clothing and accessories been preserved in the Lego diorama without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the man's clothing and accessories made from Lego components. While Lego representations typically simplify details, such as textures and folds, they seem to be intact without any distortions or unusual artifacts. The jacket, pants, and briefcase are discernible and consistent with Lego's styling norms, akin to the simplified rendering standards in such models.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the briefcase in the Lego diorama appear natural with correct ergonomics, lines, and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the briefcase is crafted as part of the Lego figure, typically having a simple, rounded structure which facilitates grasping accessories. While not anatomically detailed in the same way as a real human hand, it aligns with the ergonomic design seen in Lego figures, ensuring it functions naturally within this context.",
