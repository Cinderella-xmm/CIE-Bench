      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the chibi character with a pink Instagram frame background, positioned on the edge of the frame. While chibi characters often have stylized proportions, the visual placement combines the character's pose and the frame edge effectively. The integration looks intentional and adds a creative dimension, appearing visually plausible while honoring the original stance.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, various icons are placed around the character, along with the username 'Graceful' at the top. These elements are integrated into the scene such that they complement rather than disrupt the overall appearance. By embedding these elements thoughtfully, they contribute to the theme without appearing out of place, ensuring the scene maintains visual consistency and coherence.",
