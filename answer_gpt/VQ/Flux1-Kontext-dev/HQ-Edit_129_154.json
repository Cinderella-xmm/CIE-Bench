    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the crown-like head formed from the lid free of distorted edges or broken geometry, and does it maintain a consistent metallic surface with the original teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents a crown-like head that is visually formed by modifying the lid of the teapot. Upon examining the surface of this altered section, the edges appear smooth and the geometry seems intact, with no visible distortions or broken parts. The metallic surface of the crown-like head maintains the same textural quality and reflective properties as the rest of the teapot, indicating consistency with the original object's material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the spout-to-beak transformation maintain a smooth, continuous metallic surface without cracks, unnatural bends, or texture discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the spout of the original teapot has been creatively transformed into a beak. This transformation retains a smooth and continuous metallic surface, as no cracks or texture discontinuities are visible. The transition appears seamless without unnatural bends, ensuring that the beak remains proportional and consistent with the overall design of the teapot.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tail formed from the handle smoothly curved and proportionally aligned with the body, without abrupt angles or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle of the teapot in the edited image appears to have been utilized to resemble a tail. This tail-like structure is smoothly curved and maintains alignment with the teapot's body, showing no abrupt angles. Additionally, the material appears consistent with the rest of the teapot, exhibiting a metallic consistency without observable mismatches.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical eyes positioned symmetrically on the head, with visible cogs and soft glow that do not cause halos, color bleeding, or texture mismatch with surrounding metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical eyes added to the teapotâ€™s owl transformation are symmetrically placed on the head. They feature visible cogs and emit a soft glow, while avoiding issues such as halos, color bleeding, or texture mismatches. The eyes integrate well with the surrounding metal, achieving a harmonious blend with the head's structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden branch beneath the owl well-integrated into the scene, with consistent wood texture, shadowing, and depth relative to the original table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image replaces the original table with a wooden branch to serve as a perch for the owl-teapot. This branch is well-integrated, featuring a consistent wood texture that exhibits natural grain patterns. The shadowing and depth are appropriately rendered, maintaining a believable three-dimensional effect relative to the scene, suggesting a careful adjustment in its integration.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the engraved patterns across the body now resemble metallic feathers with consistent layering and directionality, without pixelation or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image modifies the engraved patterns on the teapot to resemble metallic feathers that suit the owl motif. These patterns are detailed and present consistent layering and directionality that corresponds to the concept of feathers, maintaining high resolution without pixelation or loss of detail. This ensures a seamless transformation from mere engravings to artfully crafted feather-like textures.",
