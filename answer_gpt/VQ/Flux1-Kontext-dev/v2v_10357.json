      "question": "Are the shapes of the teddy bear and motorcycle still recognizable after being converted to a low-poly 3-D render style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, it is evident that both the teddy bear and motorcycle maintain identifiable forms despite the low-poly 3-D render style. The essence of a teddy bear with a helmet and cape, riding a motorcycle, is successfully conveyed. The elements such as the handlebar, wheels, and engine on the motorcycle, and the helmet and cape on the teddy bear, are preserved, making them distinctly recognizable. Therefore, the shapes are recognizable.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the teddy bear and motorcycle retain their texture details without appearing overly simplified or losing important features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the low-poly 3-D style results in a simplified aesthetic. The motorcycle surfaces show less intricate detailing compared to realistic or high-definition styles; for instance, fine metallic textures are basic and show minimal reflections or nuanced detailing. The teddy bear appears as smooth, lacking the texture detail typical of fur. Consequently, the surfaces appear simplified and have lost some important texture features.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the teddy bear and motorcycle consistent with their real-world counterparts, avoiding any distortion or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the proportions of the teddy bear relative to the motorcycle appear realistic and consistent with real-world expectations. There's a balance between the sizes of the teddy bear and motorcycle that mirrors how a small bear plush might sit on a toy motorcycle. Upon comparing with Image A, the proportions align similarly, showing no distortion or unrealistic scaling.",

      "question": "Does the teddy bear appear naturally seated on the motorcycle, maintaining a believable posture and interaction with the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning and orientation of the teddy bear on the motorcycle appear natural. The teddy bear's hands gripping the handlebars and its seated posture suggest a convincing interaction with the motorcycle. The placement of the feet and body position correlates with a typical riding posture, indicating a believable seating arrangement.",

      "question": "Is the scenic background seamlessly integrated with the low-poly 3-D rendered teddy bear and motorcycle, without any visible artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background featuring the landscape and the rendered elements harmonize with no noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies. The scene's lighting and perspective allow for a seamless integration between the render style of the foreground elements and the background. The focus and alignment of shadows and colors are consistent, creating cohesiveness in the entire image.",
