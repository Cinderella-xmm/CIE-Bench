    "Question": "Q1: Are the limbs of the man and the components of the scooter proportionally coherent and free from geometric distortion such as elongated arms, bent knees, or misaligned wheels?",
    "explanation": "By analyzing Image B, the man's posture on the scooter seems natural and his limbs are proportionate. The scooter's wheels appear round and aligned, which suggests no geometric distortion. These observations are consistent with the knowledge of how a person typically sits on a scooter, reinforcing the correctness of proportions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the sepia tones cover all areas evenly without visible color banding, blotchy patches, or loss of detail in textures like fabric, stone, or foliage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sepia tone appears evenly applied across various elements such as the clothing, buildings, and foliage. There is no evidence of color banding or blotchy patches, and the textures, including the fabric of the man's clothes and stone on the buildings, retain detail, suggesting careful tone application.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the edges of the image softly degraded with a smooth transition into white, without abrupt lines or visible masking artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a transition at the edges where the frame degrades into white. This transition is smooth and lacks any abrupt lines or masking artifacts, indicating a well-executed blending technique applicable to artwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the art-nouveau frame surround the image without overlapping or cutting through the man’s face, scooter, or any background structures?",
    "explanation": "The frame in Image B is positioned around the image, complementing it instead of cutting through the man, scooter, or background structures. This placement respects typical framing practices and adds to the visual aesthetics without interfering with the main elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the blank writing area located directly beneath the image, aligned horizontally, and free from warping or interference with the scooter’s base or ground line?",
    "explanation": "The blank writing area in Image B is positioned next to the image, separated from the visual elements like the scooter or ground line. The area is aligned and without distortion, reflecting proper design layout practices.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the parchment texture appear uniformly across the image without causing blurring, ghosting, or obscuration of fine details like the man’s beard or window shutters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the parchment texture is uniformly applied without affecting fine details such as textures in the man's attire and windows. There is no blurring or ghosting, indicating that the texture enhances rather than detracts from the image detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the postcards arranged in a stack with realistic shadows, overlapping edges, and twine wrapped around them in a way that suggests physical binding?",
    "explanation": "The postcards in Image B are depicted in a stack, with overlap and realistic shadows suggesting depth. The twine appears naturally wrapped, resembling a physical binding method. These observations reflect attention to detail and three-dimensional representation, common in depictions of layered paper items.",
    "answer": "Yes"
