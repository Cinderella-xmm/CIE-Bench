      "question": "Does the addition of 'Breathe' at the top left corner blend naturally with the image without introducing any visible artifacts or disrupting the plant's structural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Breathe' is positioned at the top left corner against a plain background. It is styled in a manner that complements the overall aesthetic of the image, using a font that aligns well with the plant theme, and it does not overlap the plant or create any visual dissonance. Based on these observations, the addition is well-integrated, maintaining harmony and without introducing any discernible artifacts.",

      "question": "Is the inclusion of 'Calm' at the bottom right corner naturally integrated into the scene, ensuring that the window frame's geometry remains intact and visually plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the text 'Calm' is not present; instead, there are other plant-like graphics and a stylized text element that could be mistaken for 'Calm'. The window frame appears unaffected by these elements, maintaining its shape and alignment. Thus, the absence of any disruptive text means that the window's geometry remains intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the light reflections and shadows on the leaves natural and consistent with the lighting source, unaffected by the added text 'Breathe' and 'Calm'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the presence of text, the lighting on the plant's leaves remains consistent with a light source coming from the right, outside the window. The shadows and highlights appear natural and coherent, indicating the lighting was not altered or adversely affected by the text additions.",

      "question": "Do the texture details of the terracotta pot and its saucer remain authentic and detailed, with no degradation or introduction of unnatural textures due to the addition of text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The terracotta pot and its saucer in Image B maintain their natural texture and detailed appearance. There is no visible degradation or unnatural texture that can be attributed to the text additions. They appear consistent with typical terracotta materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the positioning of 'Breathe' and 'Calm' preserved the plant's form and the window's symmetry, avoiding any distortion or disruption in proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Breathe' is positioned in a manner that does not interfere with the plant's form or the window's symmetry. The window and plant maintain their natural proportions without any distortion attributable to the text positioning. With no visible textual disturbance, the elements remain undistorted.",
