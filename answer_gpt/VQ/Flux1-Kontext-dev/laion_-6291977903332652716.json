      "question": "Are the buildings and water surface inside the sphere free from unnatural bending or warping at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When analyzing Image B, we notice that the image appears inside a sphere, simulating the effect of a snow globe or a spherical lens. The spherical shape can naturally lead to distortion or bending at the edges due to optical effects. The image inside is curved to match the sphere shape. Therefore, some bending or warping at the edges would be expected due to the inherent spherical distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wooden beams and stucco surfaces of the houses retain clear, natural textures without pixelation or repeating patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe the spherical object showcasing the houses. The wooden beams and stucco surfaces appear distinct and textured, suggesting that the details are clear without pixelation or visible repeating patterns. This indicates that the visual quality is well-preserved inside the sphere despite scaling effects.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the water surface show smooth, continuous reflections of the buildings and sky without excessive glare or broken mirror-like effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface reflects the buildings and sky. The image within the sphere displays smooth reflections without excessive glare or broken mirror-like effects. This suggests that the representation of water is coherent and undistorted by unnatural artefacts despite potential changes in lighting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the added mini bridges connected to both banks and do the plants grow from valid surfaces without appearing suspended in air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we must identify any bridges or plant placements within the spherical scene. The bridges are not altered and maintain a valid connection between banks, while plants continue to appear rooted in appropriate surfaces rather than suspended. This indicates there is no floating or disconnected elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all visible characters have five fingers per hand, natural limb proportions, and clothing that conforms to body shape without clipping or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains miniature human figures placed outside the sphere, suggesting a diorama effect. These characters, upon examination, appear to adhere to realistic anatomical proportions and features. The characters have discernible fingers, appropriately shaped limbs, and clothing that fits their forms well.",
