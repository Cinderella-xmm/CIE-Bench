    "Question": "Q1: Are the limbs proportionally elongated without visible kinks, unnatural bends, or disconnected segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs appear to be proportionally elongated. They maintain smooth curves and natural bends without any visible kinks or discontinuities. This depiction aligns well with common artistic perspectives on limb proportion where smooth transitions and coherent lengths are emphasized. The seamless elongation and uniform proportions reflect that there are no disconnected or oddly structured segments.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the geometric patterns on the boots and leg areas uniformly applied with clean edges and no overlapping or fragmented sections?",
    "explanation": "The geometric patterns in Image B are uniformly applied. They feature clean and precise edges, typical attributes of effectively designed motifs where patterns are consistently rendered and clear without overlapping of fragmented sections. This matches well with expectations for meticulous detailing in fashion design, especially for metallic elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do all body parts, including the skin, dress, and boots, display a consistent metallic sheen with smooth gradients and no patches of mismatched material?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elements of the skin, dress, and boots all carry a consistent metallic sheen. The visual cues suggest that the effect is uniformly distributed across surfaces with smooth gradients. There are no mismatched materials or patches visible, which aligns with artistic depictions where uniformity in material is crucial for a coherent and appealing visual representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the color palette limited to metallic tones and turquoise, with no unexpected color bleed or desaturation in the figure or background?",
    "explanation": "Image B employs a color palette that largely focuses on metallic tones and turquoise, spanning across the dress, boots, and skin with consistent saturation. There is no visible color bleed or desaturation affecting the figure or background, which is crucial in maintaining color harmony and aesthetic integrity in imagery.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the figure's pose maintain natural weight distribution and joint angles, with no floating limbs or unnatural overlaps?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure exhibits a pose that wisely distributes weight. The joint angles appear natural, maintaining a plausible stance where the limbs don't seem to float or overlap unnaturally. This mirrors good artistic practices where realistic posture helps ground the figure, enhancing visual believability and comfort.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the extended hand have exactly five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, without extra digits or fused joints?",
    "explanation": "The extended hand in Image B carries five fingers, spaced naturally and displaying appropriate curvature. There aren't any extra digits or fused joints identifiable, which matches typical hand anatomy where proportional spacing and joint definition are critical for realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
