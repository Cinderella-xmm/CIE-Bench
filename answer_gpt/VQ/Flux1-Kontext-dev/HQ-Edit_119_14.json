      "question": "Does the suit fabric display consistent texture and natural lighting without visible artifacts such as unnatural gloss or patchy areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit fabric shows a consistent, smooth texture, which reflects light naturally, indicating high-quality material. The play of light and shadow across the fabric appears realistic and appropriate, with no visible signs of artifacts like unnatural gloss or patchy areas. This suggests that the editing was done with attention to detail, maintaining the fabric's authenticity.",

      "question": "Is the top hat correctly scaled and positioned on the head, with the feather securely attached and casting a natural shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top hat is proportionately scaled to fit the width and height of the head, indicating careful editing work. The feather is positioned naturally and casts a plausible shadow, which aligns with the lighting source evident in the image. The overall positioning suggests that it is securely attached, enhancing the composition's believability.",

      "question": "Is the background fully integrated with the figure, showing no visible edges or mismatches in lighting or style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background and figure are harmoniously integrated. The lighting across the figure and the backdrop is consistent, avoiding any harsh edges or mismatches in style. This is seen in the way the shadows fall naturally and the overall style blends together seamlessly, showing no disrupted transitions between the figure and the background.",

      "question": "Do the trousers drape naturally over the legs with appropriate folds and creases, matching the figureâ€™s posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trousers drape realistically over the legs, with suitable folds and creases that correspond to the figure's posture. The creasing near the knees and the natural droop of the fabric indicate a good understanding of gravity and motion in fabric behavior, reflecting a highly accurate edit.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the high collar and cravat are neatly aligned with the neck and chest area, providing a smooth transition without overlapping or distorting the surrounding skin. The editing is precise, maintaining the correct placement and ensuring that the attire fits seamlessly around what would be the face and neck area, complementing the suit's design.",
