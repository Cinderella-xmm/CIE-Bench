      "question": "Are the golden threads on the moon evenly distributed and seamlessly integrated into the circular shape without visible breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is textured with golden threads, creating a rich embroidery effect. The circular shape of the moon and the distribution of the threads appear consistent and well-integrated, as the design follows the moon's curve without any noticeable interruptions or distortions. This suggests a careful alignment of the embroidery with the shape, enhancing the visual appeal and maintaining the integrity of the circle.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the interlocking geometric shapes on the mountain peaks align properly with the original ridge lines and maintain consistent scale and depth without floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain peaks are outlined with geometric embroidery that follows the natural curves and lines of snowy ridges. The shapes appear to match the original contours of the mountains, ensuring a harmonious and natural representation. There are no visible floating or disconnected segments, indicating that the embroidery respects the original topography and maintains a consistent scale and depth.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the embroidery patterns on the red trees aligned with their original positions and shapes, and do they display consistent thread density and direction without visible flaws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red trees in Image B showcase embroidery patterns that fill the silhouettes of the trees accurately, following the original tree positions and shapes. The embroidery threads are consistent in density, and the direction of the threads aligns with the growth direction of the branches, emphasizing natural transitions within the texture. There are no evident flaws in the thread application, sustaining the authenticity of the trees' appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the silvery-blue silk strands follow the natural curvature of the water body and show smooth transitions between sections without abrupt changes in thickness or direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the water body uses silvery-blue silk threads to simulate the reflective quality of water. The embroidery follows the natural flow and curvature of the river, creating smooth transitions between sections. The thickness and direction of threads are consistent, avoiding any abrupt changes that would detract from the seamless appearance, which suggests careful attention to the natural dynamics of flowing water.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the golden-threaded moon, geometric mountains, embroidered trees, and silk-water all share a consistent artistic style and lighting response without creating visual dissonance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The combination of the golden-threaded moon, geometric embroidery on the mountains, patterns on the red trees, and the silk threads representing water in Image B reflects a cohesive embroidery style. The various elements harmonize under a unified artistic approach, sharing a consistent response to the imagined lighting. The image maintains an aesthetic balance and avoids visual dissonance by ensuring that different elements interact gracefully with one another, creating an integrated and immersive scene.",
