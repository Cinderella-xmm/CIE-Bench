      "question": "Does the claymation texture applied to the cocktail glass maintain its structural coherence without introducing unnatural textures or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cocktail glass has been transformed into a claymation style. The glass appears as if it's made from clay, which inherently introduces a different texture contrasting with the original glass surface. The coherence in structure is maintained as the overall shape and proportions of the glass are preserved, although the fine details typical of a glass texture are replaced by a smoother clay appearance. The coherence is maintained because the overall shape and physical form are still recognizable despite the different material texture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ice cubes and liquid in the cocktail retain their visual plausibility and natural appearance after being converted into a claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ice cubes retain their cubic shape, which preserves their recognizability as ice cubes. However, the claymation style gives them a less transparent and more opaque look, which could detract from the natural appearance typically associated with ice cubes. The liquid in the cocktail appears less fluid, which reduces its plausibility as a drink. Therefore, the conversion into claymation style affects the natural appearance of both the ice cubes and liquid.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the lime slice and straw preserved without distortion in the claymation design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime slice retains its characteristic crescent shape, and the straw maintains its cylindrical form. Both elements are visually coherent and recognizable, and do not appear distorted despite the change in texture and style to claymation. Their proportions relative to each other and the glass are consistent, indicating preservation of geometric shapes.",

      "question": "Does the background, including the bar counter and bottles, retain its structural integrity and visual coherence without introducing unnatural artifacts in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements such as bar counter and bottles are depicted in a less detailed manner compared to Image A, aligning with the claymation style. The structural integrity and arrangement are similar to the original layout, allowing for visual coherence despite the simplified representation. No unnatural artifacts are apparent despite the style change.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the cocktail glass, napkin, and surrounding objects logically consistent in the claymation design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cocktail glass, napkin, and other surrounding objects like buttons maintaining a logical spatial relationship. The glass and napkin are in proportional scale, similar to the arrangement in Image A, suggesting consistent logical relationships and proportions despite the claymation transformation of certain elements.",
