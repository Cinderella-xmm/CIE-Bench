      "question": "Do the shoes appear naturally larger without any visible distortion or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoes appear well-proportioned relative to the legs and other elements. They fit naturally within the cartoon-like style of the image, with no visible signs of distortion or stretching. The visual representation aligns with typical shoe proportions, supporting a natural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the legs depicted in a cartoon-like style while retaining natural textures and avoiding unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a cartoon-like art style, which is evident from the bold outlines and simplified depiction of the legs. The legs maintain natural proportions and do not exhibit any unnatural artifacts or distortions that would compromise the visual quality. The textures are congruent with the overall art direction.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the feet on the cloud-shaped shelf look natural and structurally sound, without any floating or disconnected appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the feet on the clouds appears structurally sound and believable. The anatomy of the feet aligns naturally on the curved surfaces of the clouds, suggesting a stable and intended positioning rather than floating or disconnection, consistent with the stylized context.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the overall composition, including the interaction between the shoes, legs, and clouds, visually credible and free from distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cohesive and visually credible composition with a clear interaction between shoes, legs, and clouds. The art style is consistently applied across these elements, presenting a unified aesthetic without distortions that would misalign components or disrupt the visual harmony.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the textures and fine details of the shoes and legs been preserved, avoiding any unnatural textures or loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures and fine details of the shoes and legs are consistent with a simplified, cartoon-like style. There is a clear absence of excessively detailed textures, which is intentional in this art style, avoiding any fine detail loss or unnatural textures, thereby maintaining visual integrity.",
