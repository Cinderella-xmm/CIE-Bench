      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the cat’s body defined by clear, continuous, and uniform bold lines that follow its natural silhouette without distortion or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is outlined with visibly bold, thick black lines, which clearly define its silhouette. These lines are consistent and continuous, providing a uniform border that follows the shape of the cat without distortion or gaps. This style is typical of pop art or cartoon illustrations where bold outlines are used to emphasize the form and to separate elements distinctly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the color of the sunglasses uniformly flat orange without any reflection, gradient, or texture, and does it maintain the original shape and position on the cat’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses are depicted in a flat style with a solid orange color. There are no reflections, gradients, or textures visible, maintaining a consistent flat color style typical of graphic design or pop art. The sunglasses maintain the original shape and position on the cat’s face, similar to their placement in Image A, but are simplified in color and detail.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the beach background been converted into solid, non-blended color blocks for the sky, ocean, and sand, with no visible texture or natural gradient transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the background using bright, solid color blocks for the sky, ocean, and sand. There is no blending or gradient in the colors, which are typical of vectorized or pop-art graphics where textures and natural gradients in Image A are replaced with flat, distinct color fields.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the harness depicted using a smooth gradient fill instead of realistic fabric texture, and are the shadows under the cat composed of gradient colors rather than natural light-based shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the harness does not feature realistic fabric textures seen in Image A, instead having a fill that appears flat and follows the general design style of the image. The shadows beneath the cat are composed using color blocks rather than natural light-based shading, providing a stylized visual instead of real-world light and shadow interplay.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all major elements in the image—including the cat, sunglasses, hot dog, and background—rendered exclusively in red, blue, or yellow, with no other colors present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows major elements such as the cat, sunglasses, and background rendered predominantly in vibrant red, blue, and yellow hues. This color scheme is characteristic of pop art or poster-style graphics that utilize primary colors for distinct visual impact. There are no other colors apparent in Image B, contrasting the diverse palette in Image A.",
