      "question": "Does the Funko Pop figure box maintain the structural coherence of the original image, avoiding any unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a Funko Pop figure box added to the original image. The box's structural coherence is evident from its straight edges and clearly defined silhouette. The printed design on the box matches common packaging styles for collectible figures, with a consistent texture and no visible distortions. This suggests that the box is well-integrated into the image without interfering with the focus or balance of the scene.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine inside the box retain its proportions and physical rationality, avoiding any distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine inside the box is in a chibi style, which is characterized by exaggerated features such as a large head compared to a smaller body. In the edited image, these proportions are typical of chibi figures. The physical structure is rational according to this style, and there is no evidence of distortion or loss of crucial details in the figurine's design.",

      "question": "Are the detailed textures and lighting on the realistic figurine outside the box natural and consistent with the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The realistic figurine outside the box appears to be styled similarly to the skater person depicted within the original scene. The textures on its clothing and hair are detailed, and the lighting matches the ambient light of the environment in the image, creating a coherent look that aligns with the overall scheme. The consistent application of textures and lighting suggests a natural appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image incorporates a Funko Pop figure box seamlessly adjacent to the original skateboarding image. The transition between the skateboard ramp and the box is smooth, lacking any abrupt visual breaks or mismatches in texture and colorarity. This seamless integration is indicative of a coherent and well-executed edit.",

      "question": "Does the addition of the Funko Pop figure box and its contents maintain the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the image, without disrupting visual credibility and structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the Funko Pop box and its contents are added without disrupting the visual integrity of the scene. The box is placed strategically to avoid overshadowing essential elements in the original such as the skateboarder and graffiti wall. The authenticity is preserved through consistent textures and structural alignment, maintaining the credibility of the overall image.",
