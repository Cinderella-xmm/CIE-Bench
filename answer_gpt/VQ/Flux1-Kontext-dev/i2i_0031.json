        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the icons maintain clean geometric lines consistent with the minimalist style.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The minimalist icons in Image B, while different from realism, are designed to blend into a scenario where such icons might be used, like informational graphics. They are consistent with a stylistic choice rather than an attempt at realism, and within their context, they do not disrupt visual plausibility as they are meant to be a distinct representational style.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition in Image B to minimalist icons results in clean and intentional designs, focusing on essential shapes without fine details that are characteristic of this style. There is no visual noise, as the goal is clarity and simplicity. This style inherently avoids complexity to communicate swiftly, making it both clean and purposefully designed.",
