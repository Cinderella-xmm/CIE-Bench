    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the transformed peaks retain their original height and angularity without appearing stretched, bent, or misaligned compared to the base of the mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To analyze Image B, the peaks in the edited image appear stretched and altered from their natural angularity. When comparing this to Image A, the original image shows a more consistent alignment and angular form. The transformation in Image B has affected the natural structure, resulting in a misalignment that is evident when contrasted with the natural mountain base.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textured hide patterns on the mountain slopes smooth and consistent with natural rock formations, without repeating tile-like patterns or sharp edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture on the mountain slopes does not align with the smoothness of natural rock formations. Repeating patterns and sharp edges suggest digital alteration and are inconsistent with what would be expected in natural settings. Image A shows typical natural formations on mountain slopes, whereas Image B includes these digital artifacts.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the mossy patches and root-like strands extend naturally from existing vegetation zones and follow downhill gradients without floating above the ground or forming unnatural clusters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patches and strands appear disjointed from the natural terrain and often extend in a manner inconsistent with gravity or natural cluster formations. Comparing these elements to Image A, where vegetation naturally follows the contours and gradients, it's evident that the extensions in Image B lack cohesion and natural alignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the sinewy musculature in the valley area follow the natural curve of the depression and connect smoothly to adjacent slopes without creating disjointed or exaggerated protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows exaggerated and disjointed formations in the valley area that diverge from natural valley curves seen in Image A. The transformations introduce pronounced features that do not align with the smooth connection typical of natural landscapes. This results in noticeable protrusions that disrupt the continuity of the valley's natural descent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the transformed elements (hide, fur, musculature) within the same tonal range as the original landscape, with no sudden shifts in hue or brightness that disrupt visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B exhibit sudden shifts in hue and brightness, contrasting sharply with Image Aâ€™s natural and consistent tonal range. These abrupt changes disrupt the visual coherence of the landscape, marking a significant departure from the original palette seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are small-scale details like erosion lines, grass tufts, and rock crevices still visible and correctly aligned with the terrain, without blurring, duplication, or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small-scale details are not as easily discernible as in the original image, Image A. There is evidence of blurring and duplication that affects the visibility and alignment of these terrain details, leading to a smoother appearance that lacks the natural texture seen in Image A.",
