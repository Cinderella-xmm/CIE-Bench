    "Question": "Q2: Do the pelican’s feathers display visible layered texture despite being colored in pastel shades, without appearing uniformly smooth or pixelated?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's feathers are colored in pastel blue, with visible strokes and outlines that mimic the layered texture of real feathers. These textures indicate a stylized representation rather than a pixelated or perfectly smooth surface. The artist has included these details to maintain a sense of feather-like layering even in a cartoon style.",

    "Question": "Q6: Does the pelican appear as a flat, two-dimensional object with minimal depth cues and clean edges, consistent with a magnet design?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the pelican with a cartoonish and flat appearance, which is typical for a magnet design. The use of bold outlines, solid colors, and a lack of shading give the pelican a two-dimensional look. The edges are cleanly drawn, reinforcing the minimal depth perception often found in magnet-style artwork.",
