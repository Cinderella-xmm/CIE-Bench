      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the shrimp character’s arm and hand have five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and are they attached at a logical joint point without deforming the shrimp’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp character's arm and hand are drawn with a cartoon style, featuring three fingers rather than five. This is typical for animated characters, where simplicity and exaggeration are used for expressive purposes. The fingers are spaced evenly and with a natural curve, allowing the shrimp character to perform actions like cooking. The hand is attached to the body logically, considering the stylized nature of the character, without deforming its body.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chef’s hat cast a subtle shadow on the shrimp and have visible fabric texture and creases consistent with real-world materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chef’s hat is depicted in a cartoon style, which prioritizes clean lines and bold shapes over realistic textures. While the hat is drawn with a distinct outline and shape, it does not show a fabric texture or creases consistent with real-world materials. The focus on simplicity and exaggeration leads to a lack of shadow or detailed texture, which would be expected in more realistic illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand gripping the lemon slice positioned with fingers properly curved and spaced, and does the lemon retain its natural wedge shape and surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp character is depicted holding a lemon slice with stylized cartoon hands, which means the positioning and articulation are simplified. The fingers curve around the lemon slice, but in a way that suits a cartoon style more than realistic depiction. The lemon slice is drawn maintaining a recognizable wedge shape, still matching the expected visual cues of a lemon's appearance in cartoons.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the motion lines aligned with the shrimp’s direction of movement and do the herb particles appear to be dispersing from a logical origin point near the shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses motion lines effectively to suggest action and movement. The lines are placed in accordance with the shrimp’s actions of sprinkling or applying spices, signifying movement direction. The herb particles are drawn spreading from the vicinity of the shrimp’s hand, where the action originates, matching the cartoon styling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shrimp tails arranged in a stable, gravity-consistent pile with overlapping layers and no floating or suspended pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized pile of shrimp, used to emphasize abundance and success in the cooking process. The shrimp tails overlap in a manner consistent with a stable pile but are not perfectly aligned to real-world gravity physics, as they're drawn in a way that maximizes visual impact over realism. There are no floating pieces, suggesting consistency in layering.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all text elements clearly legible, positioned without overlapping key visual elements, and rendered with consistent stroke thickness and style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, text elements are integrated into the cartoon design for narration and dialogue purposes. However, the legibility is intentionally distorted, using a mix of readable and nonsensical words, which aligns with the playful, exaggerated theme of the comic. The text overlaps some visual elements slightly but does not disrupt the overall visual composition. Stroke thickness and style appear consistent with the overall cartoon layout.",
