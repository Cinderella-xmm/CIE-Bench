    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the stone towers, archway, and knight proportionally scaled and positioned correctly within the glass orb without geometric distortion or unnatural perspective shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone towers, archway, and knight are all contained within the orb, showing a natural perspective. The elements appear properly scaled relative to each other, and the orb maintains their geometric proportions without distortion. This indicates a consistent scaling and an absence of unnatural perspective shifts within the orb.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the stone textures on the towers and gate retain fine detail and natural variation after being minified, without appearing overly smooth or pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The detailed stone textures visible in Image B show clear fine detail and natural variation in the stonework of the towers and gate. Even after being scaled down inside the orb, these textures do not appear smooth or pixelated, ensuring that their integrity and realism are maintained at the minified size.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the antique bronze finish applied uniformly to the knightâ€™s armor and the gate, with realistic tarnish, reflections, and surface depth that match physical metal properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knight's armor and the gate in Image B have a uniform bronze finish with realistic reflections, tarnish, and depth appropriate for metal surfaces. The finishing on these objects integrates well with the lighting and shading of the scene, which matches our understanding of how metal should appear under specific lighting conditions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the heraldic flags positioned correctly on the battlements, with natural folds and orientation suggesting movement in wind, and no clipping or floating artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heraldic flags attached to the battlements exhibit realistic folds and are oriented as if moved by wind, complementing the scene's dynamics. There are no visible artifacts such as clipping or floating issues, indicating an accurate and natural integration of the flags into the environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the tiny turrets and crenellated walls around the base of the orb evenly spaced, geometrically accurate, and stylistically consistent with the main castle structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The turrets and crenellated walls at the base of the orb in Image B show an even spacing and geometric accuracy. Their style matches the main castle structure above them, displaying consistency in architectural design and ensuring visual harmony within the miniature setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the golden rays integrated into the glass surface with proper refraction and depth, creating a seamless illusion of light emanating from within the orb without visible layering or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits golden rays that seem integrated into the glass surface with convincing refraction and depth effects. This creates an illusion of light emanating from within the orb, and there are no visible layering issues or edge artifacts, producing a seamless visual experience.",
