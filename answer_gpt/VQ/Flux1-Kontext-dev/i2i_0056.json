      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style cartoon character in the edited image appears well-proportioned and centrally located within the frame.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors and materials of the chibi character's hard hat, shirt, and vest consistent with the original imageâ€™s description and appear natural in the 3D environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character wears a yellow hard hat and a high-visibility work outfit, including a shirt and vest with neon green and reflective bands.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition between the chibi character and the background shows a consistent style in both the character and the construction scene, which is rendered in a low-poly style typical in 3D animation and graphics design.

      "question": "Is the background in the edited image a simplified light gray plane with a small crane model, and is it devoid of elements from the original beach scenery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a simplified construction-themed background with light gray tones. The crane model and other construction elements replace the natural beach scenery, including sand, water, and vegetation present in the original image.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
