      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the aircraft have smooth, clear surfaces without visible distortion, scratches, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the display case surrounding the aircraft appears to have come into contact with visible distortions, which might suggest the absence of smoothness. Although some transparency is retained, the glass portrayal lacks refinement, as evidenced by the inconsistent reflections and lack of visual detailing that one would usually expect of a smooth and distortion-free surface. The process involves identifying visual anomalies that could detract from clarity, such as scratches, material imperfections, or unnatural reflections, which were evident in the edges and surface textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leather accents and brass corners attached to the display case with accurate material textures, proper lighting response, and no visible seams or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Image B shows leather accents and brass corners with realistic textures that mimic actual materials. The lighting responds naturally, enhancing the rich leather texture and metallic sheen of the brass. There are no visible seams or floating effects, meaning the components appear securely attached and display proper continuity, indicating high-quality rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the engraved emblem on the front of the display case clearly defined with appropriate depth and shadowing, and does it blend naturally into the glass surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The engraved emblem in Image B is clearly defined with visible depth and shadowing that gives it a three-dimensional appearance. However, the emblem being on the front of the wooden base of the display case rather than blending into the glass surface suggests a separation between materials, reflecting a realistic placement rather than integration with the glass.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature clouds positioned inside the glass case, visually separated from the aircraft, and rendered with soft, volumetric textures without clipping or unnatural transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature clouds are positioned inside the glass case and bear a soft, volumetric texture consistent with realistic cloud formations. They are visually distinct from the aircraft, conveying depth and separation without any clipping or unnatural transparency effects, showcasing careful placement and rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the propellers depicted with rotational motion blur and properly aligned with the engine nacelles, without deformation or clipping against the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The propellers in Image B have intentional motion blur indicating rotation, aligning accurately with the engine nacelles. There are no signs of deformation or clipping against the display case, suggesting that their placement and rendering were well executed.",
