    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the cabinâ€™s roof, walls, and windows clearly defined and geometrically consistent, even with visible brushstrokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brushstroke style introduces a swirling effect which can create an impression of a painting-like appearance. Despite this, the edges of the cabin's roof, walls, and windows remain discernible and follow logical geometric shapes. The cabin maintains its A-frame structure with edges that correspond to the logical form of a house, suggesting an adherence to geometric consistency despite the artistic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surrounding fir trees maintain their vertical orientation and layered foliage structure despite the use of loose brushwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surrounding fir trees in Image B, while stylized with visible brushstrokes that add texture and movement, still retain their upright form characteristic of fir trees. This retention of orientation and structure suggests that the brushwork enhances rather than distorts their natural form.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the smoke rise straight upward from the chimney and gradually blur outward, mimicking natural dispersion in cold air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smoke from the chimney begins with a defined column directly above the chimney which then gradually loses some definition as it rises, simulating the natural tendency of smoke to spread and blend into the atmosphere, especially in colder air conditions where the dispersion is slower.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the snow covering the roof, ground, and tree branches uniformly distributed and textured in a way that suggests natural accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of snow in Image B is rendered with textured brushstrokes, which may make the snow appear somewhat stylized, but it is consistently shown across the roof, ground, and tree branches. This distribution mimics how snow naturally settles in a landscape, maintaining a coherent representation of snowfall accumulation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the illuminated windows and string lights along the eaves softly blended into the scene, without harsh outlines or glowing halos that break the stylistic consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows emit a warm light that contrasts against the cooler colors of the snow and sky, but the use of brushstrokes and the painting style ensure that the lights blend smoothly into the scene without sharp outlines or halos that would disrupt the visual cohesion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the foreground elements (small trees, fence) appear closer than the midground cabin and background trees, preserving depth and spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs color and scale effectively to indicate depth. The small trees and the fence visually occupy the foreground, and their size relative to the cabin suggests proximity to the viewer. This organization maintains spatial logic, wherein elements closer to the viewer appear larger, helping to delineate the depth of the scene.",
