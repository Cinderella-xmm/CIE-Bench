      "question": "Are the black and blue brick textures on the motorcycle body panels uniformly aligned and geometrically consistent with the original angular design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brick textures are represented in a more stylized design with prominent blue stripes over the black motorcycle body. These elements are visually consistent with the angular design of the panels. The geometric consistency is maintained through the angular shapes and the uniform pattern seen across different parts of the motorcycle. Therefore, the alignment and consistency are visually apparent in Image B. Image A shows a simpler design without textures or bricks, focusing on plain color without these patterns. Hence, Image B shows consistent geometric patterns that align with the angular design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cog-patterned rims maintain circular shape and evenly spaced teeth that match the wheel diameter and do not appear stretched or broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B highlights cog-patterned rims with blue coloring, showing them as circular and with a consistent spacing between the cog teeth. These patterns align well with the wheel diameter and shape, showing no visual distortion or broken elements. The cog teeth are evenly arranged, maintaining structural integrity necessary for a functional rim appearance. Image A presents simpler, traditional rims without the cog design. Therefore, in Image B, the cog patterns are well designed, matching the wheel's form.",

      "question": "Are the colorful decals seamlessly embedded into the brick surface, showing no visible gaps, overlaps, or unnatural layering effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays decals on the motorcycle with vivid colors and complex branding, showing them integrated into the body design. They appear to be laid flat and consistent on the motorcycle's surface, with no visible gaps or layering issues. The decals are layered smoothly and fit neatly into designated areas without overlap on the brick patterned panels. In Image A, these decals are present but not directly related to textures or brick designs. Hence, Image B presents a smooth integration of decals.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the gray baseplate flat, continuous, and properly supporting the motorcycleâ€™s wheels without any visible elevation mismatch or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gray baseplate is uniformly flat and appears continuous, providing even and stable support for the motorcycle's wheels. There are no noticeable elevation changes or distortions that would suggest imbalance or improper support. The motorcycle in Image B sits squarely on the baseplate, implying proper alignment and design structure. The display case base seems functional and adequately designed. Image A does not depict a physical baseplate but focuses on the motorcycle alone.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the display case have clear, undistorted boundaries with no ghosting, refraction errors, or unintended shadows affecting the motorcycle's appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a clear display case around the motorcycle, showing transparency and distinct edges that present the motorcycle without distortion. The visual clarity and integrity of the case do not show ghosting effects, refraction errors, or unnecessary shadows that could obscure details or visual perception. The case is well-defined and forms a clear boundary as expected from display cases designed for showcasing objects. Image A does not have such a display case, focusing solely on the motorcycle profile.",
