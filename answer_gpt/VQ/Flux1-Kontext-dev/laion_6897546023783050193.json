      "question": "Are the robes depicted with consistent indigo and gold patterns that follow the contours of the original drapery without visible seams or unnatural texture breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robes on the statue are illustrated with indigo color and highlighted with gold patterns, mimicking the drapery. These patterns follow the flow of the robes naturally and do not exhibit visible seams or breaks in the texture, indicating a consistent and fluid design. Comparing it to Image A, the original stone drapery, the pattern in Image B effectively adheres to these contours.",

      "question": "Do the arms feature calligraphic lines that follow the natural curvature of the limbs without distorting the hands or creating more than five fingers per hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms of the statue depict flowing, calligraphic lines that align with the natural curve of the limbs. The hands are rendered with an accurate number of five fingers each, without distortion. The continuity of lines maintains the proportions of the hands and arms correctly.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds in the background are illustrated with gentle curves, aligning well with the artistic style and without any sharp boundaries or overlap with the statue's silhouette. This smooth blending ensures a seamless integration into the scene without inconsistencies in the visual composition.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue maintains a centered posture with arms symmetrically extended from the torso, reflecting the stability and alignment of the original statue in Image A. There are no visible signs of deformation or misalignment; the posture is consistent and stable.",
