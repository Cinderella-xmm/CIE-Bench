      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress is designed with a 1920s Art Deco style featuring geometric patterns and fringe elements. The dress appears to maintain a consistent silhouette that fits the subject's body well. The design elements are harmonious and do not exhibit any signs of unnatural stretching or distortion, indicating a coherent silhouette that respects the body's natural contours. This is achieved through the use of vertical lines that elongate the appearance, commonly seen in Art Deco fashion.",
