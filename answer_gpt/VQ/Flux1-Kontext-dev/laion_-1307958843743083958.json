    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the gold-finished surfaces of both cheetah figures smooth, reflective, and free of unnatural textures or patches that suggest digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetah figures are coated with a gold finish that appears smooth and reflective. The surfaces exhibit a realistic metallic shine, and there are no visible patches or irregularities indicating digital artifacts. This suggests a high-quality rendering of the gold finish on the cheetah figures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the translucent green-tinted glass façade maintain clean, continuous edges and realistic light transmission without visible distortion or abrupt transitions at its boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green-tinted glass façade is depicted with clean and continuous edges. The transparency and light transmission through the glass appear realistic without showing distortion or irregularities. The image rendering provides a seamless transition, indicating a well-executed visual representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"Savanna Essence\" clearly visible, correctly positioned on the base, and rendered with sharp edges and consistent font style without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Savanna Essence' on the base is clearly legible, positioned centrally, and rendered with sharp edges. The font style remains consistent across both figures, with no signs of blurring or misalignment. These visual attributes demonstrate the well-maintained clarity and professional design of the text representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the transformed cheetah figures maintain their original sitting posture and anatomical proportions, with no visible elongation, compression, or deformation of limbs or torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cheetah figures shown in Image B retain their original sitting posture as seen in the placement and curvature of limbs and the torso. There is no apparent alteration in the anatomical proportions, ensuring a consistent representation of the original design.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the two golden cheetah-bottle figures symmetrically aligned with the central glass façade, and do they cast consistent shadows that match the lighting direction and surface reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the cheetah figures symmetrically aligned with the glass façade, exhibiting uniform positioning on either side. The lighting direction and the surface reflection are coherent, with shadows cast consistently, enhancing the realism and spatial coherence in the alignment and overall presentation.",
