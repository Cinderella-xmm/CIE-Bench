      "question": "Does the transition between the train and the cyberpunk background appear seamless without obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is placed within a cyberpunk setting, characterized by neon lights and dark cityscape. The train appears to be integrated smoothly into this environment without visible artifacts or unnatural textures, based on the consistency in lighting and color correction applied throughout. The neon glow on the buildings aligns well with the train's surface lighting, suggesting a seamless transition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the reflections of neon lights on the train surface realistic and consistent with the expected behavior of light in a cyberpunk setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon lights from the city environment cast reflections on the train's surface. These reflections are colorful and consistent with how light would behave in a real-world setting, particularly in a dark, neon-lit urban environment typical of cyberpunk aesthetics. The placement and intensity of the reflected colors match the nearby light sources, enhancing realism.",

      "question": "Do the added headphones on the driver look natural and do they preserve the driver's visibility without obscuring important features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there are no additional elements like headphones visible on the driver or any part of the train. The interior of the train is dark and the focus is primarily on the train's exterior, meaning no editing of a driver or accessories like headphones seems to have been involved. Thus, the question appears not applicable.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the motion blur effect applied in a way that suggests movement without causing the train to appear distorted or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, motion blur effects are applied to indicate the train is moving swiftly through the scene. The effects are used thoughtfully, emphasizing speed while keeping the details of the train intact. The blur appears mainly on the train's rear and in the background, not distorting the train's shape or obscuring its structural details, which maintains the illusion of motion realistically.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall transformed image maintain a consistent edgy and cool style without introducing conflicting or out-of-place elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B embraces a cyberpunk aesthetic, with vivid neon glows, deep shadows, and sleek urban forms. The train's design and its integration into a night-time cityscape support an overall edgy and cool style. The neon reflections, dark colors, and the city backdrop complement each other, without introducing elements that appear odd or out of place, maintaining visual consistency.",
