      "question": "Does the pastel purple fur with teal accents maintain natural fur texture and gradient transitions across the body, particularly on the tail and back, without visible color blocking or artificial smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel's fur has a cartoonish appearance rather than a natural fur texture. Pastel purple and teal accents are used, which is a creative choice for the animated style. There is indeed a smooth transition between colors, suggesting a seamless artistic gradient rather than color blocking or artificial smoothing.",

      "question": "Is the backpack positioned correctly on the squirrel’s back without deforming its posture or causing unnatural bulges in the fur, and does it display consistent material texture and shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel wears a backpack that appears well-positioned as part of the animated character design. There are no visible deformities or unnatural bulges in its posture due to the backpack. The backpack exhibits consistent cartoon-style textures and appropriate shadowing consistent with the artistic style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glasses positioned symmetrically over the squirrel’s eyes with proper reflection details and soft shadows, and do they not distort the eye area or appear disproportionately large?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the squirrel with glasses that are symmetrically positioned over its eyes. The cartoonish style includes reflections and soft shadows, and fitting well with the character design, the glasses do not appear disproportionately large nor do they distort the squirrel's eye area.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Are the cartoonish flowers and mushrooms positioned at plausible distances from the squirrel, showing correct occlusion and depth cues, and do they have consistent textures and shading?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the cartoonish flowers and mushrooms are positioned in such a way that they appear at plausible distances from the squirrel, giving correct occlusion and depth cues. The textures and shading are coherent and fit well with the overall animated style of the image.",
