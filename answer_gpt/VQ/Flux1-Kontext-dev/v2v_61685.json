      "question": "Do the simplified human figures and the background tent maintain their structural coherence without introducing unnatural geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures and the tent are simplified, turning into basic shapes. The shapes are clean, solid, and reflect a simplistic style, successfully maintaining structural coherence. The natural curves and straight lines are retained, avoiding any bizarre geometries. This demonstrates that the editing maintains the integrity of the structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors restricted only to blues, whites, and the man's green shirt, and do they appear natural without introducing any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a limited palette as observed: different shades of blue, whites, and the green shirt of the man, creating a visually themed appearance. This deliberate reduction to flat colors removes texture details but ensures the new stylistic choice remains visually coherent and pleasing, without introducing any unnatural aspects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the text 'SKATE FOR ALL' integrate seamlessly into the upper cloudy sky region without disrupting the natural appearance of the clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text is placed prominently on the upper part of Image B, where it does not overlap with the area's cloud elements, maintaining its own distinct space. The integration does not disrupt the initial flow of background elements. The text adaptation to the new graphic style ensures seamless integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the human figures and skateboards maintained realistically, avoiding any distortion or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures and skateboards, although simplified, retain their natural proportions. The reduction in detail does not imply any distortions or scale problems; the figures and objects maintain a believable proportion in relation to each other, which is evident in their relative sizes and shapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the skateboards and clothing been preserved without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's design style inherently reduces fine details to create a more stylized and artistic representation. The reduction to flat colors and shapes means textural and detailed elements are minimal, but it does not introduce any unintended textures or forms. Instead, the artistic choice aligns with the intended look without appearing distorted.",
