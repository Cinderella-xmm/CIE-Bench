    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the orange and yellow flower petals in the headpiece free from color banding, pixelation, or sharp, unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange and yellow flower petals appear vibrant and realistic, with smooth transitions between colors. The petals have a natural appearance without noticeable color banding, pixelation, or sharp edges. This observation is based on the visible details of the petals' texture and edges, which appear seamless, suggesting high image quality. Comparatively, Image A also presents flower petals with a similar natural and smooth finish.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the black, orange, and yellow braids in the headpiece maintain consistent thickness, smooth curvature, and uninterrupted strand alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows braids in the headpiece with consistent thickness, smooth curvature, and well-aligned strands throughout. The colors are well-integrated between the black, orange, and yellow segments, maintaining a uniform pattern. This consistency suggests high craftsmanship in the design or quality editing. In Image A, the braids exhibit similar quality, with no discernible inconsistency or misalignment, confirming that the edit preserved the original braid structure.",

      "question": "Are the gold earrings reduced in size and repositioned on the headpiece while preserving their intricate mesh patterns and metallic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original earrings have been replaced with a different element that resembles cartoon-like figures, suggesting that the gold earrings have not been reduced or repositioned in the headpiece. The earrings maintain their position as actual hangings from the ear rather than being integrated into the headpiece. Image A showed traditional gold earrings with intricate designs and a metallic sheen. Thus, Image B does not showcase reduced or repositioned earrings on the headpiece.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the flowers, braids, and earrings positioned so that they appear physically connected to the head and hair without gaps or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers and braids are closely aligned with the natural contour of the head and hair, showing a seamless integration without visible gaps. The earrings also hang naturally from the ears. This suggests deliberate positioning where each element appears connected to the head. Image A shows a similar setup with the flowers and braids closely integrated with the hair, indicating consistency in physical linkage in both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, unnatural shadows, or texture discontinuities at the edges of the headpiece where it meets the face or hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any seams, unnatural shadows, or discontinuities at the junction of the headpiece and the hair or face. The transition appears smooth, maintaining a realistic and coherent texture. This visual observation indicates quality editing if alterations were made. Image A similarly presents a seamless integration of the headpiece with no disruptive elements or shadows, maintaining consistent quality across both images.",
