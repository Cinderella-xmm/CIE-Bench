    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transition between the dog and the banana appear smooth and natural without any visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the area where the dog and the banana are adjacent, there are no visible seams or unnatural edges that suggest an artificial merging. The alignment and placement appear natural, consistent with how objects might be positioned together outdoors.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the dog and the banana consistent with each other and the surrounding grass, indicating a natural light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting effect on Image B shows uniform illumination on both the dog and banana. The shadows are consistent in direction and intensity, aligning well with the background grass, suggesting a singular natural light source rather than artificial lighting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or loss of fine details where the dog and the banana connect, disrupting the visual quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures are intact, with the dog's fur and banana peel retaining their natural details without any noticeable interruptions or loss of quality at the point where they are visually proximal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the dog and the banana remain realistic and proportional to each other, avoiding any unnatural stretching or shrinking?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions between the dog and the banana appear consistent with a realistic depiction. There is no visible distortion, like stretching or shrinking that would undermine the perception of their relative sizes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the materials of the dog's fur and the banana's peel retain their natural texture and appearance, contributing to the overall realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows detailed textures on both the dog's fur and banana peel. The fur retains its natural appearance of fine strands, and the banana skin is smooth and blemished naturally, enhancing the overall realistic look.",
