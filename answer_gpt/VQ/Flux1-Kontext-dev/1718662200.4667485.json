      "question": "Is the head of the pig significantly larger than the body without causing visible distortions in the neck or shoulder area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the pig's head is noticeably large compared to its cartoonish body style. In such caricature designs, exaggerated proportions are common. The pig's neck and shoulders do not show any signs of distortion or unnatural connections to the body in Image B. Thus, the head is larger but fits well with the design style without distortion.",

      "question": "Are the green sunglasses properly rendered with consistent color and reflective properties matching the original style, without unnatural edges or texture breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig wears green sunglasses in the top two frames, and they appear consistent in color. The cartoon style allows for flat coloring without reflections, which aligns with the design aesthetics. There are no visible texture breaks or unnatural edges that disrupt the appearance of the sunglasses.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the pig's hands on the turntable have five fingers each, with natural finger spacing and curvature that match typical animal anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features cartoon pigs with simplified hands that resemble animal anatomy but do not have distinct fingers. Typically, cartoon animals don't have detailed anatomical accuracy. Instead, the hands resemble hooves with a more stylized approach. Therefore, the pig hands do not have five fingers as stated.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is composed of vibrant, psychedelic patterns. These colorful backgrounds are part of a unified style with no sudden edges or contrasting lighting issues. The background complements the flamboyant character theme, with smooth edges and harmonious integration.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The middle section of Image B includes a chat bubble surrounded by brightly colored soundwave patterns.
