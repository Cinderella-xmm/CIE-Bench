      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Do the textures of the character's clothing and painting tools appear natural and detailed in the Chibi stickers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Chibi art, detailed textures are typically simplified; however, they should still appear natural within the style's context, using simplified lines and forms to suggest texture. In Image B, the character’s clothing and painting tools are depicted with enough detail to convey their identity and function naturally within the Chibi style.",

      "question": "Are the shapes and lines of the character's hands in the Chibi stickers natural and ergonomic, with no more than five fingers on each hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi illustrations usually depict hands that are simplified but should adhere to basic ergonomic shapes matching human anatomy, such as having five fingers per hand. Image B shows the character's hands consistent with these criteria, as the fingers represent a natural and cartoonish ergonomic alignment with no more than five fingers per hand.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi and Ghibli styles are known for vibrant, warm color palettes that contribute to a lively and appealing aesthetic.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A transparent background is typically void of any additional designs, allowing the sticker's main illustration to stand alone without distraction. In Image B, each sticker has a transparent background without any extraneous artifacts, ensuring the focus remains on the character without interference.",
