      "question": "Do the deep burgundy drapes hang naturally with smooth folds and consistent shadow gradients, and do they cast realistic shadows on the wall and floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the deep burgundy drapes appear to have smooth folds, which suggests that they hang naturally. The shadows the drapes cast seem to be consistent with the folds and follow a logical gradient from the light source, giving a realistic look as they extend to the wall and floor. The visual cues indicate an understanding of how light interacts with materials of this nature.",

      "question": "Do the cherub images on the pillows show visible brushstroke texture, subtle color gradients, and seamless integration into the pillow surface without sharp borders or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the cherub images on the pillows in a manner that suggests quality and attention to detail. The images seem to integrate seamlessly into the pillow surface, with subtle color gradients that enhance their realistic appearance. The absence of sharp borders or pixelation indicates that these images are well-rendered.",

      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the new canopy drapes and gold woodwork match the direction of the ceiling light and fall consistently on adjacent walls and floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows from the canopy drapes and gold woodwork appear to align consistently with the ceiling light, indicating a coherent light source direction. The shadows cast are positioned in such a way that they correspond to the source of illumination, matching the expected fall on the walls and floor.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the redesigned canopy bed fully contained within the room boundaries, with no parts extending beyond the ceiling or overlapping the wall, and does it maintain a realistic scale relative to the nightstand and rug?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The canopy bed in Image B appears to be proportionally scaled and correctly placed within the room's boundaries. The bed does not extend beyond the ceiling or overlap the walls, and it maintains an appropriate size relative to the nightstand and rug, which suggests a realistic and coherent integration with the rest of the room's layout.",
