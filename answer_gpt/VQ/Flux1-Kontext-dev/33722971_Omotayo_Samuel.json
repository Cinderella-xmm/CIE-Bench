      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the facial features on each suitcase align naturally with the object’s shape without distorting its geometry or creating unnatural protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suitcase with facial features has a smiley face drawn on the round object, which looks like it could be a drum case. This smiling face aligns naturally with the round shape, appearing friendly and cartoonish. The features do not create any distortion, and their placement seems intentional, fitting the circular area without stretching or warping. Compared to Image A, where this feature was absent, Image B has added these details thoughtfully.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure have five fingers per hand, with natural hand shape and joint alignment, and no anatomical deformities or missing limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B, wearing a long black coat, has their hands in the pockets of the coat. Due to this positioning, it is not possible to count the fingers or verify the natural shape and joint alignment directly. However, based on what is visible, there do not appear to be any deformities or missing limbs at a casual inspection. Since the question involves checking for missing limbs and deformities, and what is visible seems natural and proportional, an assumption can be made that there are no such issues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the velvet texture applied smoothly across all surfaces without visible seams, repetition, or unnatural lighting reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop consists of a world map and red velvet curtains. The velvet curtain texture appears even and smooth, without visible seams or repetitive patterns. The lighting on the velvet is consistent with the rest of the scene, and there are no unnatural reflections indicating an editing oversight.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the world map backdrop properly aligned with the scene’s perspective and does it integrate seamlessly without warping or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The world map backdrop in Image B is framed within a display case. It appears to align well with the perspective, matching the expected angles and proportions. There is no visible warping or clipping that would suggest a misalignment with the physical setup of the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the display case fully enclosing the scene with correct proportions, no clipping of elements, and realistic glass transparency or reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the display case appears to have defined edges enclosing the entire scene, featuring realistic proportions and no evidence of clipping through its borders. The glass has a subtle reflective quality, expected in such a presentation case, suggesting realism in its transparency and the lighting dynamics across its surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all fine details (e.g., stitching, hair, texture edges) preserved and free from blurring, ghosting, or pixelation after editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains fine details such as the texture of the coat, the stitching on the suitcases, and the strands of hair. These details are coherent and lack signs of blurring or ghosting. The quality and clarity indicate careful post-processing where details were preserved.",
