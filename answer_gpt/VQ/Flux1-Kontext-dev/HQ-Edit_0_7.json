      "question": "Does the chibi-style parrot maintain smooth feather textures and proportional body parts without visible warping or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style of the parrot appears well-rendered with smooth textures and proportional body parts. The feather details visible on the parrot maintain clarity and do not exhibit any warping or pixelation, indicative of high-quality digital rendering. This conclusion is drawn from examining the details and smooth gradients visible on the parrot's body and feathers.",

      "question": "Are the oversized leaves around the branch proportionally larger than surrounding foliage without appearing stretched or unnaturally shaped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows oversized leaves around the branch, but they are proportionally larger than the surrounding foliage and do not appear stretched or unnaturally shaped. The leaves maintain consistent curves and contours, which suggests they were intentionally depicted to create a dynamic composition rather than being misrepresented by distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the crystal beads on the leaves appear as clear, spherical droplets with subtle reflections and no visible digital artifacts or smudging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal beads in Image B appear as clear, spherical droplets on the leaves, featuring subtle reflections that suggest realistic lighting effects. There are no visible digital artifacts or smudges, which indicates a high level of detail and care in their depiction, reflecting the attention to realistic portrayal.",

      "question": "Is the explorer positioned on a separate branch at a believable distance and scale, with correct limb orientation and no distortion in form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of the explorer in Image B shows him positioned at a believable distance and scale relative to the branch and chibi parrot. His limbs are oriented in a natural manner, with no apparent distortion in form, suggesting proper proportional representation and logical placement within the scene.",

      "question": "Does the base of the glass dome feature a consistent wood texture with etched tribal patterns that blend naturally into the rainforest setting without sharp edges or lighting inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the glass dome features a consistent wood texture with detailed etched tribal patterns. These patterns blend naturally into the rainforest setting, and there are no sharp edges or lighting inconsistencies, implying harmonious integration into the overall design aesthetic of the scene.",
