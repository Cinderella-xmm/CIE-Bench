      "question": "Does the frosted crystal frame preserve the original carved details (such as the floral crest and side columns) without warping or flattening the shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frosted crystal frame clearly showcases intricate details such as the floral crest and side columns. The carvings appear well-defined and maintain their three-dimensional appearance, similar to what would be seen in a wood-carved frame, indicating that the shapes have not been warped or flattened. The preservation of these details in a different material, such as crystal, suggests that the integrity of the original design has been maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Roman numerals etched into the crystal face evenly spaced, legible, and aligned with the original hour positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Roman numerals on the crystal face are clearly visible, evenly spaced, and legibly etched. They are aligned correctly with traditional hour positions, ensuring that they are not distorted or improperly positioned. This alignment corresponds with typical clock designs where numeral placement is crucial for time reading.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the faceted crystal pendulum symmetrically shaped, properly suspended by the chains, and free from floating or misaligned connections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faceted crystal pendulum exhibits a symmetrical shape, consistent with typical symmetrical crystal designs. It is shown as being correctly suspended by a chain system that appears realistic and proportionate. There are no indications of floating or misalignment, maintaining a cohesive visual and mechanical connection, suggesting suitability for a pendulum.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white marble wall uniformly textured, free from visible stitching or artificial boundaries, and does it cast soft, natural shadows beneath the clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white marble wall displays a uniform texture characteristic of polished marble, with smooth and consistent veining patterns without visible stitching or artificial boundaries. The clock casts soft, natural shadows onto the wall, contributing to a realistic appearance, as would be expected from a natural marble surface under appropriate lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crystal components (frame, face, pendulum) visually integrated without noticeable gaps, material inconsistencies, or unnatural reflections at their junctions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal components are seamlessly integrated, with no visible gaps between the frame, face, and pendulum. There are no material inconsistencies, indicating uniformity in the crystal material used. The reflections appear natural, with light interacting appropriately with the crystal surfaces, suggesting a cohesive and well-executed design.",
