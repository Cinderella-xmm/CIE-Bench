      "question": "Does the gold spoon maintain the same structural coherence as the original fork with no unnatural texture or distortion in the handle and bowl area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold spoon has a smooth handle and a well-shaped bowl, indicative of proper structure. The edges are well-defined, and the surface of the spoon is free from distortions or unnatural textures. In comparison to Image A, which features a neatly structured fork, the gold spoon maintains coherence in its form. The absence of warping or irregularities suggests that the spoon's shape aligns well with expected metallic utensils.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the interaction between the gold spoon and the napkin appear natural without disrupting the napkin’s texture or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold spoon rests naturally on a blue napkin, with the contours of the napkin visible and consistent around the spoon’s edges. The folds in the napkin do not exhibit any misalignment or disruption where the spoon is placed, indicating a seamless interaction. The shadows and highlights appear consistent with the physical placement of the spoon. Image A shows a fork with similar natural placement on the napkin, supporting the realism in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the patterns on the gold spoon integrate naturally with the scene and appear as part of the spoon rather than a separate overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold spoon in Image B features intricate patterns that appear carved or embossed into the surface. The patterns follow the contours of the spoon's bowl and handle, suggesting integration rather than a separate overlay. There are no visible edges or inconsistencies that might indicate the patterns are separate. This contrasts with the plain surface of the fork in Image A, showing the spoon's distinctive design is coherently part of the utensil.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the gold spoon exhibit realistic reflectivity and shine consistent with a metallic spoon under the lighting conditions of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold spoon displays a sheen typical of metallic surfaces, with highlights reflecting the surrounding light in a realistic manner. The lighting appears consistent across the spoon, adding to a sense of depth and dimensionality. This reflects a similar metal sheen found on the fork in Image A, suggesting the light source and metallic material are realistically represented in both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the size and positioning of the gold spoon proportionate and physically logical in relation to the napkin, avoiding any unusual scaling issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold spoon in Image B is appropriately sized relative to the napkin, with the proportions similar to what is expected for dining utensils in a real-world setting. The positioning is central and aligned with the napkin, enhancing the composition without introducing scaling discrepancies. Compared to the fork in Image A, the spoon fits within similar boundaries, maintaining logical scale and placement.",
