      "question": "Does the handwritten word \"Draft\" on the yellow paper appear seamlessly integrated without unnatural textures or color discrepancies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the handwritten word 'Draft' is closely observed for consistency in color and texture with the yellow paper and the pencil nearby. The color of the text is a solid black, which contrasts well with the bright yellow background but matches typical ink or pencil markings. There are no visible signs of misalignment, shadows, or pixelation that could indicate overlay issues, suggesting seamless integration.",

      "question": "Is the style and material of the handwritten word \"Draft\" visually consistent with the pencil used in the image and typical design sketches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handwritten word 'Draft' in Image B is styled in a cursive font, resembling traditional hand-drawn typography. The boldness and smooth finish of the text are consistent with what a quality pencil might produce in professional or artistic sketches, which often use similar fonts for headers and labels. Thus, the style aligns well with the artistic purpose and the visual theme of the image, which involves pencils and sketching tools.",

      "question": "Has the addition of the handwritten word \"Draft\" preserved the structural integrity of the yellow paper, avoiding any distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the yellow paper maintains a flat appearance without any signs of bending or warping where the word 'Draft' is placed. Additionally, there is no indication of the word causing any physical alteration to the paper's shape or appearance, ensuring that the structural integrity remains consistent throughout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the handwritten word \"Draft\" sharp and clear, without introducing any unnatural blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text forming the word 'Draft' in Image B is observed to have clean, sharp edges. This lack of blurring or pixelation indicates high-quality integration within the image, suggesting that the text was carefully added to preserve clarity and contrast, consistent with high-resolution graphics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the pencil on the yellow paper remain physically logical and visually credible after adding the handwritten word \"Draft\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pencil's tip is positioned close to the top of the letter 'D' in 'Draft', which logically implies it is actively creating or has just created the text. The angling and placement of the pencil are visually consistent with how one would use a writing instrument to form similar letters, maintaining the realistic depiction of the pencil's role in the writing process.",
