    "Question": "Q1: Does the main body of the teapot appear as clear glass with visible internal reflections and refractions consistent with transparent material, without any opaque or metallic residue?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the main body of the teapot indeed appears to be made of clear glass. The visual cues indicate transparency, as the internal reflections and refractions are consistent with glass, lacking any opaque or metallic residue. The glass's clarity allows for the floral patterns to be visible, suggesting a typical glass teapot design. This observation aligns with common characteristics of glassware, which includes the ability to refract light and be transparent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the floral patterns on the glass surface uniformly frosted with no signs of smudging, uneven opacity, or artificial texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the glass surface appear uniformly frosted. The opacity is consistent throughout, with no visible smudging or texture artifacts, maintaining a refined and polished appearance. The frosted design complements the transparency of the glass, illustrating a typical process used for aesthetic detailing on glass surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the handle and spout exhibit a consistent amber tint with smooth gradients and sharp boundaries, without color fringing or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "The handle and spout of the teapot in Image B showcase a consistent amber tint. The gradients are smooth, and the boundaries are sharply defined without any color fringing or unnatural highlights. This reflects the common practice in craftsmanship where colored glass or coated metals are used to provide a distinct and uniform appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the reflection under the teapot symmetrical, sharp, and correctly aligned with the objectâ€™s base, showing accurate contours and transparency effects?",
    "explanation": "The reflection under the teapot in Image B is symmetrical and aligns accurately with the object's base. The contours are sharp and demonstrate transparency effects, which are typical properties of reflections on highly polished surfaces such as glass or mirrors. This suggests careful attention to detail in the rendering or photographing process.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the proportions of the lid, spout, handle, and body preserved such that there are no stretched, compressed, or misaligned sections compared to the original?",
    "explanation": "To assess the preservation of proportions, comparing Image A to Image B is necessary. Both images show the same teapot with similar proportions across the lid, spout, handle, and body, with no apparent stretching, compressing, or misalignment in Image B as compared to Image A. This indicates that the edited image maintains the design integrity without distortion, which is crucial for preserving the aesthetic appeal of the object.",
    "answer": "Yes"
