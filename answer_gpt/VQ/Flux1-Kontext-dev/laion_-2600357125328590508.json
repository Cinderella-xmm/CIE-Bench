    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the LEGO brick structures aligned with the original sockâ€™s contours, maintaining consistent proportions and avoiding warped or stretched geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual observation of Image B, the LEGO bricks appear to mimic the contours of the sock quite accurately, maintaining consistent proportions when compared to a typical sock shape. The bricks do not show evident warping or stretching, so the alignment and proportions seem coherent with socks' form, aided by the structured nature of LEGO bricks forming a cohesive outline.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the layered LEGO bricks follow the natural curves of the sock, forming a cohesive 3D structure without gaps or misaligned layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks are arranged in a way that suggests they follow the natural curves of a sock, such as wrapping around the ankle and contours of the foot. The layers appear to be well-aligned, forming a unified 3D structure without noticeable gaps or layers that seem out of place, supported by typical LEGO uniformity and consistent building techniques.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the black, gray, and white LEGO bricks arranged to match the original sock's pattern layout, including the \"UNO\" text and accent stripes, without color inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO bricks in Image B carry the pattern and colors similar to what a sock might have, with distinct 'UNO' text and stripes visible. The arrangement of colors parallels the depiction of a standard sock, closely aligning its characteristic features with Lego style without significant color mismatches.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the orange LEGO piece positioned at the top of the cuff and integrated into the brick structure without floating or unnatural attachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange LEGO piece is distinctively positioned at the top of the cuff area and is integrated smoothly into the structure. There are no signs of floating or unnatural attachment, as it seems fixed in place following the typical LEGO brick assembly which provides stability and seamless connection.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sculpture presented upright against a clean, uniform background with even lighting that highlights its 3D form without casting unnatural shadows or reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B is shown upright against a simple, uniform backdrop, ensuring focus on the object itself. The lighting is even, highlighting the dimensionality of the 3D LEGO sculpture without yielding any odd shadows or reflections, facilitating a clear visual understanding.",
