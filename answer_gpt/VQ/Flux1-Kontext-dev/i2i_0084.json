      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dog and its blue mat appear consistent with the lighting of a snowy mountain setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and blue mat are placed in a snowy mountain setting that usually has diffused, brighter lighting. The dog's shadows are soft and consistent with the common lighting found in open, snowy environments. The highlights on the dog's fur and the blue mat also match the ambient light and reflection expected from a bright location. Therefore, the shadows and highlights appear consistent with the setting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dog's fur retain its natural texture and detail without showing any unnatural artifacts after being placed in the snowy environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's fur maintains its natural texture and appears detailed, with no signs of pixelation or unnatural smoothness that could arise from editing processes. The fur's details, such as individual strands, are visible, consistent with how animal fur would look in high-quality imagery. Thus, the dog's fur retains its natural texture and detail.",

      "question": "Are the size and proportions of the dog and its blue mat appropriately scaled in relation to the tent and other elements of the snowy campsite?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and its blue mat are positioned near a tent within a snowy setting. The scaling appears realistic, as the dog seems to be a typical size relative to the tent, which could accommodate one to two persons. The proportions and size of the mat also appear functional for the dog's size. Thus, the scaling seems appropriate.",

      "question": "Are the edges of the dog and its blue mat smoothly integrated into the snowy mountain campsite without any visible jagged or unnatural lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the edges of the dog and its blue mat blend seamlessly into the snowy environment. There are no visible cut lines or breaks in the visual continuity, suggesting a high level of integration that avoids unnatural or jagged edges. Therefore, the integration appears smooth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dog's posture and the overall layout of the snowy campsite appear natural and free from distortion or unnatural positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's posture as it lies on the blue mat is natural, similar to how dogs usually rest. The overall layout of the snowy campsite, including the tent and background scenery, appears thoughtfully arranged without signs of distortion or awkward positioning. This contributes to a cohesive and believable scene.",
