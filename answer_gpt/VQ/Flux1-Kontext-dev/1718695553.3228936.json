    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the white studio background uniformly flat and free of shadows, texture mismatches, or visible edges where it meets the toy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the white studio background appears smooth and consistent without visible shadows, texture irregularities, or edges that disrupt the seamless look around the toy. A flat studio background is typically used for product photography to avoid distracting elements and maintain uniform lighting conditions. Therefore, the background meets these criteria.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the logo tag on the hippo’s ear properly aligned with the knit texture, showing realistic thread stitching and no unnatural color or shape distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the logo tag on the hippo's ear should integrate smoothly with the knitted texture, as the tag is an add-on meant to appear as part of the toy's crafting process. It should follow the shape and pattern of the textured knit. An analysis shows that the tag may lack stitching detail and could present some distortion. Effective rendering should depict realistic attachment with aligned texture.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the circular patch on the hippo’s side have consistent knit texture and thickness with the surrounding fabric, without raised or detached appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking closely at the circular patch on the hippo’s side in Image B, it should maintain the same knit texture and thickness as the surrounding body fabric. Consistency in these details ensures the patch appears as a natural part of the toy, rather than an added piece with potential mismatches. The patch appears integrated seamlessly with the rest of the fabric.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the packaging box positioned behind the toy at a natural distance, with consistent lighting and shadow alignment that matches the direction of light on the toy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging box should logically sit at a plausible distance behind the toy, showing proper perspective and scale. The lighting on the box should align with that on the toy to maintain a consistent scene, with shadows falling in a direction coherent with the light source. The box’s positioning and shadow alignment suggest a realistic setup with matching lighting conditions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the plastic window on the box front transparent with subtle reflections and no distortion of the toy’s image visible through it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plastic window should reveal the toy inside the box with clarity, transmitting light so that external reflections indicate typical transparency. In Image B, the absence of clarity issues or distortions confirms the plastic’s functionality as an effective viewing window, crucial for assessing the product within packaging.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the text elements clearly visible, correctly spaced, and rendered with smooth edges without jaggedness or overlapping with other objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text on Image B’s packaging should be legible, aesthetic in spacing, and smoothly outlined. Proper branding involves clear typography that avoids pixelation or overlap, ensuring readability and visual appeal. Evaluation shows well-rendered text elements meeting these conditions.",
