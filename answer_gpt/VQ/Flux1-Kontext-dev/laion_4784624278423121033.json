    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the atom illustration placed in the same location as the original dough and does it have a smooth, continuous edge without jagged lines or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the atom illustration is centrally located within its section and appears to have smooth, continuous edges, resembling how an atom might typically be represented in a clean, vector-like style. This contrasts with Image A, where there is a real physical dough cutout with possibly uneven and non-uniform edges due to the nature of actual dough. The illustration in Image B seems to be designed to have precise lines and shapes, typical for an educational graphic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the additional atom-shaped cookies the same size as the original dough and do they have colors that blend naturally with the beige dough and wooden background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the additional atom-shaped illustrations are depicted in bright, vibrant colors such as red, green, orange, and blue, and appear significantly distinct from a natural beige dough color. Moreover, their sizes are consistent with being illustrations rather than 3D dough objects and do not appear to blend with the beige dough or wooden background. In contrast, Image A only shows the actual dough cutter and the result of its imprint on the dough.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arrows point directly to the correct parts of the atom (electrons, protons, neutrons) without crossing over or distorting the atomic shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrows are visually placed to indicate concepts related to the model of an atom such as electrons, protons, and neutrons, with some arrows appearing to connect or relate different atom illustrations. However, the positioning of these arrows leads to a somewhat cluttered depiction that might not precisely indicate the exact placement of these components (such as protons or electrons). This is a conceptual depiction rather than showing accurate atomic configuration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the title text \"Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry\" clearly visible, positioned above the illustrations, and does it not overlap with the atom shapes or cookie cutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title text at the top reads 'Atoms & Cookies:' but the following words are jumbled and incomplete, potentially meant to say something akin to 'A Sweet Chemistry'. However, parts of this text appear overlapping or less legible, diminishing clarity and coherence. Moreover, there is no significant overlap with the atom shapes below but the faulty typography reduces the overall clarity.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dotted lines straight, uniformly spaced, and positioned between sections without covering the atom illustrations or cookie cutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dotted lines demarcating sections around the atom illustrations are straight and neatly positioned to separate each illustration without covering or obstructing them. This segmentation fosters an orderly division of content into distinct sections, enhancing visual clarity and distinction between each atom/image.",
