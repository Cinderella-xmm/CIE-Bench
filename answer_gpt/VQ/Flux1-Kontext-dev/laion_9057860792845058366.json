      "question": "Are the reflections on the robot’s body uniform and physically consistent with a metallic surface, without streaks, over-saturation, or mismatched highlight areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's body is designed with glossy metallic surfaces. The reflections appear uniform, with consistent highlights typical of metallic materials, showing a smooth surface finish without streaks or over-saturation. The highlights are distributed in a manner that simulates how light interacts with metallic surfaces. This is in contrast to Image A, where the robot has a matte finish, lacking the reflective metallic sheen.",

      "question": "Is the holographic display on the chest transparent and layered above the surface without warping or clipping into the surrounding armor plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a holographic display on the robot's chest which appears transparent and is clearly layered above the armor surface. The holograms do not appear to warp or clip into the physical design of the armor plates, suggesting consistency with how holographic displays should visually function. Image A lacks such a feature, allowing a distinct comparison based on observed virtual display norms.",

      "question": "Are the control icons in the digital interface overlay sharp, readable, and positioned without overlapping key mechanical components such as the shoulders or torso joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital interface overlay includes control icons that are sharp and readable, distinctly contrasting with the background. The icons are positioned strategically so as not to interfere with mechanical components like shoulders or joints. This suggests a clean user interface placement typical of well-designed overlays. Image A does not feature such elements for comparison.",

      "question": "Is the smartwatch accessory attached to the forearm without bending or deforming the arm’s structure, and does it have a clean, seamless connection point consistent with magnetic attachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a smartwatch accessory on the robot's forearm, appearing smoothly attached without distortion to the arm's structure. The attachment point is visually seamless, consistent with a magnetic attachment method. This attachment can be contrasted with Image A, which shows a simpler design without such accessories.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the floating tech interface symbols in the background evenly spaced, sharp-edged, and free from jagged outlines or ghosting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, floating tech interface symbols are observable in the background, characterized by even spacing and sharp edges without any visible jagged or ghosting effects. These qualities contribute to a clean and futuristic appearance of the symbols, representing a coherent digital display. Image A does not contain similar elements for direct comparison.",
