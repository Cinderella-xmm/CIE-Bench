      "question": "Are the enlarged knitting needles proportionally consistent with the size of the woman's hands and aligned naturally with her fingers without bending or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knitting needles are visible in the woman's hands as she is knitting. The analysis involves observing if the dimensions and orientation of the needles match the typical way needles are held while knitting. The needles should align naturally with the fingers, appearing proportionate and not overly elongated or distorted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the steam lines above the teacup rise smoothly from the rim in a continuous, curved pattern without sharp breaks or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam lines in Image B are visually assessed based on standard expectations of steam rising smoothly from a hot liquid. A natural steam pattern would involve soft, organic curves as shown in drawing or animated illustrations. Sharp breaks or abrupt angles would indicate a lack of fluidity in the representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transformed yarn pattern on the fabric retain consistent knit stitches and natural thread flow without visible pixelation or irregular textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The yarn in Image B is evaluated on its density, stitch consistency, and how naturally the yarn appears to flow as part of the knitted fabric. Given the art style, uniformity in stitch appearance and the absence of any rough digitized texture would indicate effective transformation into the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the writing panel positioned within the open book pages such that its edges align naturally with the page boundaries and the knitted border matches the texture and color of the surrounding fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the open book in Image B, I consider the alignment of written content within the confines of each page. The panel's edges must be parallel with the page margins, and consistency in color and texture would ensure it integrates seamlessly with the illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the added lamplight effect produce a gradual glow around the book and cup without creating unnatural bright spots or conflicting shadows on the armchair or wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In reviewing Image B, the lamplight effect is assessed by observing how light spreads from the lamp onto adjacent surfaces, such as the book, cup, and surrounding areas. A natural effect would diffuse softly, producing realistic shadows and avoiding harsh lighting discrepancies.",
