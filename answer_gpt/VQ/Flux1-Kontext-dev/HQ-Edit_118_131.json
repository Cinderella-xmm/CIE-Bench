      "question": "Are the added gears and copper accents seamlessly integrated into the silver surface of the teapot without visible texture inconsistencies or material discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot does not display visible gears or copper accents integrated into its surface. The teapot appears to maintain consistent silver craftsmanship with floral and elephant motifs similar to traditional ornate silverwork. Without actual gears and visible copper accents present in Image B, the question of seamless integration is not applicable, leading to the conclusion based on absence rather than presence.",

      "question": "Does the curved glass dome appear transparent and smoothly contoured without geometric distortions or artificial edges that break the illusion of a real glass enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome encasing the teapot and teacup features clarity and smooth contours. The dome maintains a consistent curvature and transparency without distortion or visible edges, presenting a convincing illusion of real glass due to the seamless curved design and reflective light behavior. These visual indications ensure its realistic representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wooden floorboards and scattered tea leaves rendered with realistic textures and proportions, and do the tiny silver utensils appear appropriately scaled and detailed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a wooden base rather than floorboards, with tea leaves and silver utensils arranged on it. Both elements exhibit realistic textures; the wood displays natural grain patterns, while the tea leaves show varied shapes and colors typical of natural leaves. The silver utensils appear detailed and appropriately scaled next to the teapot and teacup, adhering to realistic proportions, consistent with expected natural rendering.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the moss accents naturally distributed along the base edge, with soft, organic texture and no signs of unnatural clustering or color mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moss accents along the edge of the wooden base in Image B appear naturally arranged, displaying organic texture and shading that blends with the wooden surface without unnatural clustering or color anomalies. This consistent shading and distribution give the moss a realistic appearance, akin to genuine moss settings decoratively enhancing nature-themed displays.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the steam effect emerging from the elephant's trunk appear as a smooth, translucent vapor with natural diffusion and no jagged edges or artificial glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, steam is visible emerging from the elephant's trunk. The vapor displays smooth transitions and translucent qualities expected from realistic steam diffusion. It avoids jagged edges, instead flowing naturally, enhancing its believable appearance without artificial glow interference. Such visual effects contribute to a natural portrayal of steam as might be observed in real-world conditions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the vine-like metalwork elements consistently shaped and positioned around the dome, following natural curvatures without intersecting the glass unnaturally or creating inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moss accents surrounding the dome base mimic decorative organic embellishments rather than vine-like metalwork. However, their positioning does not interfere with the dome's glass contour or create inconsistent shadows. Instead, the consistent and organic style adheres seamlessly around the dome's base, retaining coherent aesthetics in line with nature-inspired designs.",
