    "Question": "Q1: Do the holographic widgets and 3D elements on the smartphone screen appear seamlessly integrated with the device's surface, maintaining consistent depth cues and shadowing that match the phone's form factor?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone screen features holographic widgets and 3D elements that appear to be designed to stand out from the phone's surface, creating a futuristic look. The visual integration of these elements relies on consistent depth cues and appropriate shadowing to give the impression that these widgets are floating just above the screen surface. The use of blue hues and subtle glow effects contribute to this integration, making the elements appear as if they are part of the device's ecosystem. While these integrations are visually appealing, the challenge lies in ensuring they match the curvature and dimensions of the smartphone, which they successfully do here.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the forward-projection effect of the smartphone screen visually coherent, with no distortion of the phone’s frame or screen edges, and does it maintain proper spatial relationship with the hand holding it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the forward-projection effect of the smartphone screen is characterized by the visual elements extending outward from the screen. The coherence of this effect relies on maintaining intact the phone’s frame and screen edges. The image projects the graphical interface forward in a way that aligns well with the hand holding the device, ensuring the screen elements do not detach from the phone or the associated gestures by the hand. The proportions and angles observed seem to complement the hand's position naturally, without noticeable distortion or misalignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the biometric hand scanning overlay align precisely with the hand’s natural anatomy, showing accurate finger positions and skin texture, without introducing extra fingers or distorted proportions?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates a biometric scanning effect overlay on the hand. This overlay must be anatomically accurate, matching natural hand positions and textures. The visual effect encompasses the hand without altering its size or introducing any extra fingers. The alignment with each finger and skin texture upholds the realistic depiction of the hand, maintaining proper proportions and a natural appearance.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the futuristic skyline displayed on the laptop screen rendered with consistent geometry and perspective, and does it align naturally with the laptop’s bezel and keyboard without clipping or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the laptop screen showcases a futuristic graphical user interface, including elements consistent with geometric consistency. The placement of these visual attributes aligns with the laptop screen, ensuring that no clipping occurs along the edges or bezels. The keyboard and the laptop's edges correlate naturally with the displayed graphics, indicating a harmonious construction of visual space and perspective within the frame.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the smartphone and laptop displays share consistent visual design elements (e.g., blue color palette, futuristic typography, and interface style) that create a cohesive technological narrative without conflicting styles?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts both the smartphone and laptop screens exhibiting a synchronized visual design language. This is observed in the uniform blue color palette, matching futuristic typography, and interface styling creating a seamless technological narrative. The styles and thematic choices are consistent across devices, presenting an interconnected and coherent digital ecosystem without clashing stylistic elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
