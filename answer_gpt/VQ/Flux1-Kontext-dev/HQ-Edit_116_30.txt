    "Question": "Q1: Does the entire cathedral structure appear uniformly rendered in warm stained wood with consistent grain patterns and realistic wood textures across all surfaces, including spires, arches, and tracery?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral structure is represented as a model within a shadow box with details showing wood-like textures. The entire model, including spires, arches, and tracery, features a stained wood appearance with consistent grain patterns. This consistency is realistic, as the model is designed to mimic a wooden miniature. The visual cues and the choice of material convey this effectively.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the edges of the shadow box clearly defined, structurally coherent, and proportionally sized relative to the cathedral model, with no visible gaps, misalignments, or floating components?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shadow box containing the cathedral model is structurally coherent, with well-defined edges and proportional sizing relative to the model. The frame appears solid, with no gaps or misalignments, and there are no components that seem to be floating or out of place. This indicates careful craftsmanship in the depiction of the shadow box.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the tiny pews and chandeliers positioned correctly within the interior of the cathedral model, maintaining proper scale and alignment with architectural features like columns and vaults, and do they cast consistent shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the pews are present at the base of the shadow box and some figures are visible, they are not part of the cathedral interior itself, and so they're not in alignment with architectural features like columns and vaults. The chandelier is seen in the upper left of the frame rather than in an interior setting. Additionally, the shadows around the elements in the box don't clearly indicate proper scaling or alignments, more towards a decorative layout end than a strict architectural alignment.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the clock mechanism located at the back of the model, featuring visible gears and a moving path for small figures, with no distorted shapes, inconsistent materials, or implausible motion trajectories?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a clock is present at the upper right side of the shadow box, but there are no visible clock mechanisms, gears, or moving paths for figures. The clock face is plain and lacks detailed mechanical components that would show such features, making it implausible to describe any motion trajectories of figures around it. The placement of figures and clock indicates aesthetic rather than functional consistency.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the intricate gothic carvings, including the rose window, flying buttresses, and sculptural elements, retain sharp detail and accurate geometry in the miniature model without visible blurring, pixelation, or deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gothic elements like the rose window, flying buttresses, and sculptural details are intricately detailed and keep their defined sharpness. The model's carvings reflect the accurate geometry typical of gothic architecture, coinciding with the craftsmanship of miniature models. There are no visible signs of blurring, pixelation, or deformation, indicating high fidelity in execution.",
    "answer": "Yes"
