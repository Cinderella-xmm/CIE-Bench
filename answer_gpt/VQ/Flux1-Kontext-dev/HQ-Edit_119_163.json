      "question": "Is the cylindrical body of the tea canister proportionally consistent with the original teapot’s scale and maintains continuous, undistorted dragon engravings along its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tea canister's body is cylindrical, with leaf patterns finely detailed. While dragon engravings are originally found on a teapot, in this image, the canister features leaf designs instead. This indicates a shift from dragon engravings to botanical motifs, suggesting a thematic or stylistic change. As dragon engravings are not evident here, considering the transformation from a curved teapot surface to a straight-sided canister would generally require adaptation to avoid distortion; however, without directly observing dragon engravings in Image B, their preservation cannot be assessed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the screw cap appear seamlessly integrated with the canister body, with no visible seams or mismatched textures, and does it exhibit consistent metallic sheen and fine leaf embossing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the screw cap on the canister is rendered with a metallic finish consistent with the body, showing no visible seams and integrating smoothly. It has a leaf design embossing, matching the style on the canister body, achieving a cohesive look. The metallic sheen is similarly distributed across both elements, creating unity in texture and appearance, indicating seamless integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"Dragon's Delight\" aligned smoothly along the spout’s curve, with legible, evenly spaced characters that do not distort the underlying metal texture or cause unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, 'Dragon's Delight' is not placed on a spout but rather on the cylindrical body of the tea canister. The text appears to be straight and horizontally aligned, with evenly spaced and legible characters. There is no visible distortion of the metal texture beneath nor unnatural shading caused by the text placement, maintaining the aesthetic harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tea leaf logo centered on the cap’s top, rendered with clean lines and uniform depth, and free from jagged edges or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tea leaf logo is prominently displayed at the top of the cap. It is centered and depicted with clean lines, showcasing an attention to detail. The depth of the logo is consistent, and the lighting complements the design without introducing jaggedness or uneven edges, ensuring a refined presentation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dragon engravings fully intact and evenly distributed across the cylindrical body, with no gaps, repetition, or warping that would suggest deformation during the shape conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cylindrical body of the tea canister does not feature dragon engravings; rather, it is adorned with leaf patterns. Since dragons are not present on the canister, one cannot evaluate their intactness or distribution. Therefore, considering deformation during conversion from a teapot is impractical without the dragon motif.",
