    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the corners and edges of the hotel building preserved with consistent angles and proportions, and is there a clear transparent boundary (glass) enclosing the scene without warping or breaking the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hotel building is encapsulated as part of a miniature-like scene contained within a glass boundary. The corners and edges of the building maintain consistent angles and proportions typical of an architectural structure, which are visible through the clear glass of the enclosure. The glass boundary is unbroken and without distortion, suggesting it does not warp or break the visual continuity of the structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the water layers in the pool show consistent transparency and refraction, allowing visibility of submerged objects and swimmers without jagged edges or color artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pool water appears uniformly blue textured without displaying typical transparency or refraction seen in real water, possibly to achieve a model-like appearance. Visibility of submerged objects and swimmers does not feature realistic refraction, but rather fits a miniature aesthetic. Though consistent with the editing goal, it suggests lack of jagged edges and artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the sunbathers on the lounge chairs have correctly proportioned limbs and recognizable clothing details, and do the nearby trees display natural leaf density and branching without pixelation or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunbathers appear as part of a model scene, with proportioned limbs fitting miniature people. Though clothing details are simplified, they remain recognizable within the scene context. Nearby trees and vegetation, enforced with uniform leaf density and branching, avoid pixelation or texture repetition, maintaining the crafted model look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the greenery flowing from the rooftop follow a continuous, downward trajectory with realistic shadowing and attachment points, and does it blend naturally with the building’s exterior without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, greenery covers the building, presenting a downward trajectory from rooftop to ground level with uniform shadowing. Its attachment points blend seamlessly with the external building structure, avoiding visual glitches such as floating or clipping issues, therefore fully integrating and enhancing the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the beach accessories near the pool edge correctly sized and placed on solid ground, avoiding overlap with people or furniture, and do they have natural material textures (e.g., fabric, plastic)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beach accessories, such as umbrellas and lounge chairs, are sized to align with the proportions of the miniature scene. Their placement avoids overlapping with people and maintains spatial awareness. The textures of these accessories reflect simplified rendering befitting the model scale while implying typical material appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the floating 3D clouds exhibit soft gradients and subtle shadows, hover above the building without intersecting its structure, and maintain consistent lighting with the rest of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases small, cartoonish clouds with soft gradients and lighting coherence relevant to the scene. Positioned cleverly above the building, they don’t intersect with or detract from the architectural structure presence, aligning lighting and shadow seamlessly across the edited environment.",
