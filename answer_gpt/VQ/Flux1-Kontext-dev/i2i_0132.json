      "question": "Do the hands and arms of both individuals maintain natural proportions and shapes without appearing distorted or having unnatural numbers of fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands and arms of both individuals appear to be proportionate and shaped naturally. There are no visible distortions or abnormalities in the number or appearance of fingers. The arm length and positioning seem consistent with typical human anatomy, reflecting realistic hand movements expected when reaching out to catch a frisbee.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the characters' clothes and the grass field preserved naturally without losing detail or creating unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures on the characters' clothes are smooth and appear stylized, reflecting typical artistic choices in illustrations rather than realistic textures. The grass field also looks more uniform and lacks the detailed texture seen in photographic images. However, this artistic style does not create unnatural patterns or distract from the scene, indicating intentional aesthetic choices rather than loss of detail.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the lighting in the edited image accurately reflect the original sunlight direction, maintaining shadow and highlight placements in a natural manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting shows a consistent direction, similar to how sunlight might fall, but it is applied in a more artistic manner. The shadows and highlights are positioned deliberately to evoke depth and movement. While not perfectly realistic, the placements avoid conflicting directions, suggesting consistency in the lighting scheme.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the positioning and trajectory of the frisbee in mid-air consistent with realistic motion, avoiding any apparent physical inaccuracies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frisbee in Image B is positioned above the space between the two characters, appearing to be in mid-arc as one might expect when being tossed between players. Its trajectory is believable given the hand positions of both individuals, maintaining the illusion of motion without introducing any odd angles or unrealistic positioning.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the facial expressions and body postures of the characters align naturally with their dynamic poses and the context of playing frisbee, without any exaggerated or inconsistent distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the characters' faces are blurred, their body postures are indicative of an interactive and playful moment. The arms are extended in a way that suggests intent to catch, and the stance of both players supports natural movement required for frisbee playing. The absence of exaggerated or distorted poses aligns with the playful context.",
