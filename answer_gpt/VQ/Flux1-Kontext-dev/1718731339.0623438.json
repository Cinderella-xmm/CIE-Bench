    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all fine details such as spikes, rivets, and surface scratches on the armor clearly visible and undistorted after miniaturization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor on the miniature figure retains clear visibility of its intricate details such as spikes, rivets, and surface scratches. The miniaturization process does not seem to have distorted these details. By examining the armor, it's evident that the fine details are well-preserved, reflecting the craftsmanship even at a small scale.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the glass dome enclose the figure without visible seams, distortion, or unnatural refraction effects that alter the appearance of the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears to enclose the figure seamlessly, without any visible seams, distortions, or unnatural refraction effects. The armor retains its original proportions and appearance, indicating that the dome does not alter its visual characteristics.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cogwheels at the base fully connected to the foundation, with interlocking teeth and consistent size ratios, and no floating or disconnected parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the cogwheels at the base seem to be fully integrated with the foundation. The teeth of the cogwheels are interlocking properly, suggesting a consistent size ratio and proper alignment, with no floating or disconnected components visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical wings securely connected to the shoulder armor, matching the metal texture and spike design, and free of unnatural bends or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any mechanical wings attached to the shoulder armor, thus the question regarding their secure connection, texture matching, and joint misalignment does not apply. Since there are no wings present, the analysis focuses on the existing armor and its secure and consistent presentation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the copper pipes follow continuous paths along armor joints, maintain consistent diameter and smooth bends, and avoid intersecting with key armor components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no copper pipes visible running along the armor joints. This makes it inapplicable to assess their path continuity, diameter consistency, or intersection with armor components. The focus remains on the existing decorative details of the armor.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the brass orbs positioned at varying distances around the figure, not touching or clipping into the armor or dome, and displaying uniform material finish and lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brass orbs surrounding the figure in Image B are positioned at strategic varying distances and do not touch or clip into the armor or the glass dome. They display a uniform material finish and consistent lighting, contributing to a harmonious composition around the central figure.",
