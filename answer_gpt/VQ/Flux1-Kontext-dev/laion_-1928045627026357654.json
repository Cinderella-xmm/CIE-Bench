    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the male's shirt display a consistent 3D plush texture with no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural shading that breaks the illusion of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the male's shirt texture appears smooth and consistent, without pixelation or jagged edges. The shading enhances the depth effect, reflecting accurate 3D rendering. Using world knowledge of fabric texture in digital imagery, the visual assessment indicates quality rendering with realistic texture and shading.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the collar of the male's shirt proportionally enlarged without distorting the neck or shoulder line, and does it maintain smooth contours without sharp or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the shirt's collar is proportioned properly, matching the neck and shoulder lines. The visual cues suggest smooth contours, reflecting the natural look of shirt collars in digital edits without distortion or irregular edges.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the pleats on the female's pants symmetrically arranged and physically plausible, without floating or overlapping layers that defy gravity or fabric tension?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pleats in Image B appear uniformly arranged with symmetry that reflects a plausible representation of pant design under gravity and fabric tension. These observations in visual cues and knowledge of clothing dynamics confirm their realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the enlarged sleeve on the femaleâ€™s top extend naturally from the shoulder without distorting her arm or causing unnatural gaps or overlaps near the elbow and hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sleeve on the female's top extends naturally from the shoulder, maintaining the overall form without distorting the arm. The absence of unnatural gaps or overlaps is indicative of proper rendering in digital apparel design, aligned with world knowledge of fabric behavior.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the pastel-colored stage beneath the characters evenly lit and proportionally scaled, with no abrupt color shifts or shadow inconsistencies that suggest poor integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an evenly lit pastel-colored stage that fits the scale of the characters. The consistent lighting and absence of abrupt color and shadow shifts reflect smooth integration in a digital setting, based on principles of visual harmony and proportional scaling.",
