      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D models of the horse and elephant maintain their current pose without any unnatural distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style 3D models of a horse standing on an elephant are inspected for pose and structural integrity. The models retain a stable and balanced pose on the elephant's back, with no visible signs of unnatural bending or warping in their anatomy. The simplified, cartoonish styling doesn't imply distortion but rather an intended artistic choice. Thus, both models maintain their pose without distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the photorealistic background of the grassy field and sky free from any artifacts or distortions introduced by the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a grassy field and sky, which appear consistent with a photorealistic depiction. There are no visible editing artifacts, distortions, or discrepancies in the blending between the 3D models and the background. The sky and grass maintain a natural look resembling an actual landscape, indicating a clean editing process without visual disruptions.",

      "question": "Does the ornate photo frame blend naturally with the scene without causing any visual disruption or introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an ornate photo frame that encases the scene, complementing the 3D models effectively. The frame is detailed and adds a classic presentation to the scene without conflicting with the image content or introducing disjunct textures. The entire scene, including the frame, appears cohesive, adding an aesthetic layer without causing disruptions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi-style 3D models of the horse and elephant preserved, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style 3D models in Image B exhibit exaggerated but deliberate proportions typical of chibi art. Despite the playful stylization, the models of the horse and elephant maintain logical proportions relative to each other, without visible areas of geometric disruption or scaling issues. The horse remains stably over the elephant, consistent with chibi design principles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D models retain fine details without any loss or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi 3D models of the horse and elephant showcase a smooth, polished surface without granularity that might suggest a loss of detail. Textures are evenly applied across the models, conforming to the chibi aesthetic. No unnatural or jarring textures appear, indicating the models retain their intended stylistic detail.",
