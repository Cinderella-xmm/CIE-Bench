      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the silver and turquoise geometric patterns evenly distributed across the handbag's surface without visible misalignment, stretching, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handbag features silver and turquoise geometric patterns that cover a significant portion of its surface. The patterns appear uniformly and evenly spaced, with clean edges, indicating consistent design. There is no visible misalignment or pixelation; the colors and shapes are smooth, reflecting even distribution. World knowledge suggests that such symmetrical and well-defined patterns are typical of high-quality design work, especially on items like handbags where aesthetics are important.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic accents on the leather straps appear seamlessly integrated, with no sharp edges, inconsistent shading, or floating highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic accents on the leather straps of Image B look harmoniously integrated with the rest of the handbag. There are no sharp edges or abrupt shade changes that would suggest poor integration. The highlights on the metallic parts appear consistent with the lighting of the overall image. World knowledge allows us to recognize that well-crafted handbags incorporate these elements smoothly to maintain both aesthetics and functionality.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the machine-age engravings along the edges of the handbag continuous, properly aligned with the contours, and free from broken lines or overlapping patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the machine-age engravings seen on the handbag edges are continuous and follow the contours of the handbag accurately. The lines are unbroken and patterns do not overlap irregularly, indicating a coherent design. Observing the engraving style and using world knowledge on industrial design can help appreciate such craftsmanship as precise and detailed, common in quality products.",

      "question": "Are the front pockets and zippered closure still clearly defined and structurally coherent, with no distortion in their shape or placement relative to each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The front pockets and zippered closure in Image B are distinct and maintain their structural integrity. The arrangement appears logical and coherent, with the pockets properly defined and the zipper aligned appropriately across the handbag. World experience with handbags shows that functionality requires clarity in features such as pockets and closures for ease of use, which is evident here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the transformed surfaces exhibit realistic material properties, such as subtle texture variation and appropriate light reflection, without appearing flat or digitally over-rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed surfaces of Image B display realistic material qualities. The texture variations on the silver and turquoise surfaces show subtle depth and the light reflections are consistent with realistic lighting, avoiding overly artificial rendering. World knowledge of materials and textures in product design shows that realistic finishes are achieved through proper texturing and shading, both present in the image.",
