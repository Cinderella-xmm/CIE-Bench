    "Question": "Q1: Is the edge of the snow globe smooth and continuous, with no visible seams, distortions, or pixelation along its surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe displays a seamless and smooth boundary, a common feature in high-quality glass snow globes. The material appears uninterrupted and polished, suggesting it is intended to represent glass. There are no obvious seams, distortions, or pixelation, which would usually interrupt the smooth surface expected in a snow globe, consistent with my understanding of such objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the reflections and refractions on the snow globe surface consistent with how light behaves on clear glass, showing subtle bending of the scene behind it and soft highlights?",
    "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B appears to have a realistic depiction of light interaction qualities typically associated with glass. There are subtle refractions that slightly bend the scene of the Great Wall inside the globe, and there are highlights that suggest light reflecting off a smooth surface. This matches the expected behavior of light interacting with a glass object.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do all visible figures inside the snow globe have complete and correctly proportioned limbs, with no extra fingers, missing arms, or distorted postures?",
    "explanation": "The figures inside the snow globe in Image B appear to be accurately proportioned with limbs that seem complete and correctly posed. There are no anomalies such as extra appendages, missing parts, or awkward postures that would indicate error or distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the autumn-colored leaves integrated smoothly into the existing green vegetation, with no abrupt color changes or blocky textures indicating digital overlay?",
    "explanation": "The autumn-colored leaves inside the snow globe in Image B are floating in the air, not placed against green vegetation, which eliminates the possibility of abrupt transitions or blocky overlays against foliage. They appear natural and contextually appropriate within the confines of the snow globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the snow particles visible throughout the globe in a dynamic, swirling pattern, and do they not fully cover the Great Wall or figures, allowing them to remain clearly visible?",
    "explanation": "There are no visible snow particles inside the snow globe in Image B. Consequently, the clarity of the Great Wall and the figures inside is not obstructed, maintaining the visibility and clarity of the scene captured within the globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the ceramic birds clearly distinguishable as small flying objects with defined wings and bodies, and are they located in the air above the Wall without touching any surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while there are objects resembling flying leaves, there are no ceramic birds present. The leaves are distinguishable and positioned above the Wall, but no ceramic objects meet the described criteria.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the wooden base dark in color, textured with realistic grain, and does it support the snow globe without floating or tilting, with the engraved text clearly legible?",
    "explanation": "The base of the snow globe in Image B appears dark with a wood-like texture, supporting the globe in a stable manner. The text 'Great Wall Memories' is clearly legible, embossed on the base, confirming its realistic representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
