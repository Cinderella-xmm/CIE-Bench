    "Question": "Q1: Does the leaf inside the snow globe maintain its natural shape and texture without any visible distortions or unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Based on Image B, the leaf appears to maintain its natural shape and texture. The detailed veining and color consistency indicate that there are no visible distortions or unnatural artifacts affecting the leaf. This observation is derived from visual cues such as the recognizable shape and consistency in color, common in real leaves.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the snowflakes around the leaf inside the snow globe visually plausible and do they enhance the scene without introducing unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snowflakes surrounding the leaf within the snow globe appear visually plausible. They add a magical quality to the scene without introducing any unnatural textures. The shimmer and distribution of snowflakes simulate common visual patterns seen in snow globes, which aligns with world knowledge of decorative snow globes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the gentle ripples in the water around the leaf inside the snow globe look natural and do they maintain the structural integrity of the leaf?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts gentle ripples in the water around the leaf, contributing to the realism and maintaining the structural integrity of the leaf. The ripples are a natural occurrence around floating objects, supporting the leaf's position on the water and enhancing its stability and natural appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the snow globe rest naturally on the tabletop with realistic reflections and refractions, contributing to the overall visual credibility of the scene?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the snow globe resting on the tabletop with realistic reflections and refractions of light. These reflections contribute to the scene's credibility, creating a visually believable interaction between the snow globe and its environment. This is supported by world knowledge of glass and light behavior.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the softly blurred background with warm tones free of any unnatural artifacts and does it harmoniously blend with the snow globe scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the softly blurred background features warm tones that blend harmoniously with the snow globe scene. There are no visible unnatural artifacts disrupting its visual coherence; instead, it provides an appropriate context that enhances the focus on the snow globe, which is typical in photographic compositions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
