      "question": "Do the cactus arms show smooth, continuous segmentation without abrupt breaks or distorted joints, and do the glowing orbs at their ends appear naturally attached and aligned with the limb direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms of the cactus are depicted with smooth segmentation that follows the shape of the limbs without showing abrupt breaks or distorted joints. This suggests a continuous flow and natural growth pattern. However, there are no glowing orbs at the ends of the limbs, eliminating concerns about their attachment or alignment. The limbs themselves exhibit a segmented appearance similar to some stylized depictions of plants or creatures. The smoothness and continuity of the segmentation are consistent across the limbs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the iridescent scales evenly distributed across the cactus surface, following the original rib pattern without visible seams, repetitive textures, or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the cactus in Image B showcases a pattern of iridescent scales, providing the cactus with a unique, alien-like appearance. These scales appear to be evenly distributed and follow the rib patterns traditionally associated with cacti. The colors are vibrant yet consistent, with no visible seams or abrupt, unnatural shifts in color, which contributes to the overall coherence of the object's design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the crystal spine rise vertically from the base of the cactus with consistent facets and internal clarity, maintaining alignment with the original trunk and showing no signs of digital clipping or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a crystal-like central column that extends vertically from the base of the cactus. This spine aligns well with the trunk, demonstrating consistent facets and clarity without any digital clipping or edge artifacts. The smoothness and vertical alignment are maintained throughout its height, offering an appearance of structural integrity and coherence with the rest of the cactus's unusual design.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bioluminescent tendrils positioned along the cactusâ€™s surface in a coherent, organic pattern, with consistent thickness and spacing, and do they cast soft glows that match the ambient lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tendrils emerging from the cactus in Image B do not appear to be bioluminescent, but instead follow an organic, spiraled pattern consistent with artistic styling. They maintain consistent thickness and spacing, contributing to a cohesive look. However, given that they do not appear to glow bioluminescently, they do not match any potential ambient lighting considerations regarding soft glows. Therefore, their positioning and coherence can be noted, but not their bioluminescent effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the base of the transformed cactus fully grounded in the sand, casting a shadow that aligns with the light source and does not show floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the cactus appears firmly grounded in the sand, showing consistent shadows that align with the registered light source direction. There are no indications of the cactus floating or showing disconnected sections from the ground. The shadows cast by the limbs also appear to be well-integrated with the lighting conditions present in the scene, suggesting a logical adherence to natural shadow casting rules.",
