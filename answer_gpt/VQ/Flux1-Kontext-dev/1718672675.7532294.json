      "question": "Do the armor-like rock sections maintain visible sedimentary layering and natural erosion contours consistent with the surrounding cliff face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor-like rock sections of the figure do not maintain the same sedimentary layering and natural erosion contours as the surrounding cliffs. The armor appears to be more artificially crafted with smoothness and defined shapes that do not match the organic, weathered appearance of the natural rock formations in Image A. The surrounding cliff in Image A displays more natural features like irregular erosion patterns and sedimentary layers, which are characteristic of a weathered cliff face.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the moss growth confined to shaded or moist areas of the rock armor and does it show natural variation in density and color rather than uniform application?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moss growth on the figure is not limited to shaded or moist areas and does not display natural variation in density and color. Instead, the moss appears uniformly applied to cover important areas of the figure's body, giving the impression of an intentional design rather than a natural growth pattern. In a natural setting, moss would vary in density and color depending on environmental factors such as light and moisture availability.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the spectral limbs originate from the cliff base and merge with the sea surface in a way that preserves water-level continuity and avoids floating or detached appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spectral limbs of the figure have a glowing, ethereal appearance with streams that appear to emerge from the base of the figure's legs and extend downwards. The streams, while energetic, appear somewhat detached from the sea surface, giving an impression of floating rather than a seamless merge. This lack of continuity suggests a supernatural element rather than a natural formation blending with the water.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees forming the mane spaced irregularly and angled naturally along the cliff edge, consistent with wind exposure and terrain slope?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees on the figure's 'mane' do not show an irregular spacing or angling that would be consistent with natural wind exposure and the slope of terrain. The formation appears deliberately shaped to fit the figureâ€™s design rather than naturally influenced by environmental factors. In contrast, natural trees on a cliff might grow at various angles and spacing due to wind and landscape features, observable in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the runes follow natural rock fissures and exhibit soft edges with shadowing that matches ambient lighting, rather than appearing as crisp, untextured overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure does not show runes following natural rock fissures; rather, they appear as part of the figure's surface ornamentation. They lack the soft edges and ambient shadowing needed to integrate organically with natural rock surfaces. Instead, they have more distinct outlines, contrasting with potential natural fissures one might expect in true rock structures.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the spiraling spirits emit or absorb light in a way that matches the sun's position and create subtle volume effects consistent with mist or vapor, without sharp edges or unnatural opacity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spiraling blue light emanates in a way that contrasts with the natural lighting setting due to sharp edges and an unnaturally luminous appearance inconsistent with the subtler, diffuse lighting as given by the sunset. In a real setting, mist or vapor would show softer volume effects, capturing ambient light and not emitting a distinct glow. Thus, these elements mismatch the harmonious sun position lighting seen upon the natural landscape.",
