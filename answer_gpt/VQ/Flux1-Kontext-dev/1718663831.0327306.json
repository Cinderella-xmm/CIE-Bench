      "question": "Does the fur of the plush dog appear uniformly soft and textile-like with no visible pixelation or unnatural texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the plush dog's fur exhibits a smooth and consistent texture, suggesting a textile-like softness common in well-made stuffed animals. There are no noticeable signs of pixelation or texture artifacts that would detract from the visual quality. This aligns with expectations of a high-quality plush appearance where fur looks uniformly soft and crafted.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the crystal-studded corset properly aligned with the dog's torso and does it display consistent, physically plausible reflections and sparkle without distorted shapes or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the corset is secured on the plush dog and appears well-aligned with the torso. The reflections and sparkle of the crystals are consistent, maintaining a realistic appearance without any distortion or misplacement. This suggests careful design, mimicking how crystals naturally reflect light, adhering accurately to the curvature of the plush torso.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the dog’s paws positioned correctly so that they slightly dangle over the edge of the shelf without intersecting or floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the plush dog's paws positioned such that they naturally rest on the shelf with a part slightly overhanging the edge, creating a realistic and expected scenario for a plush resting on a shelf. There is no indication that the paws intersect or float above the shelf, adhering to physically plausible positioning consistent with real-life orientations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sandy-colored spots on the plush dog’s ears and face maintain their original placement and shape as seen in the original image, without bleeding or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Review of Image B regarding sandy-colored spots on the plush dog's ears and face shows that these elements have been preserved in terms of placement and shape compared to Image A. The spots retain their original appearance and do not show signs of bleeding into other areas or distortion, maintaining the integrity of the design from the original.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features of the plush dog, including the snout, mouth, and nose, proportionally accurate and structurally coherent with the rest of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Excluding the blurred face in Image B, the structuring of the plush dog's face is not visible for analysis. Therefore, detailed visual assessment of snout, mouth, and nose for proportional accuracy and structural coherence is infeasible.",
