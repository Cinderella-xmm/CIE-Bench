    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transition between the original elements (birds and branch) and the new background (starry night sky and moon) appear seamless without any unnatural artifacts or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the elements such as the birds and branches with the new starry night background is smooth. There are no visible breaks, lines, or artifacts that disrupt the continuity of the scene. The birds and branches have been integrated well into the nighttime setting, appearing as part of the original image rather than pasted onto it.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors and lighting of the starry night sky consistent with the rest of the image, and do they not introduce any unnatural artifacts or conflicting light sources?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The starry night sky in Image B uses deep blue tones which are consistent with a typical nighttime scene. The lighting matches the dim glow from the moon, and there aren't any artifacts or conflicting bright areas that don't align with the expected lighting of such a scene. The overall color palette is harmonious, creating a unified image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the placement and appearance of the new moon natural within the context of the night sky, and does it not appear out of place or overly bright compared to the stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is placed centrally and prominently within the sky. Its brightness is appropriate, standing out against the night sky, yet not overwhelmingly so. It provides a natural light source for the scene, while the stars are visible but subtler in luminosity, ensuring that the moon does not appear out of place.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the birds retain their detailed features, texture, and proportions after the background change, showing no signs of distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The birds in Image B still showcase detailed features, such as the texture of their feathers and correct anatomical proportions. The change in background has not led to any loss of detail or distortion, preserving the realism of the birds within the altered setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tree branch and leaves appear naturally lit and integrate seamlessly with the starry night sky, without any obvious inconsistencies in shadowing or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree branch and leaves are subtly lit consistent with a night-time illumination coming from the moon. The shadows and highlights on the foliage are coherent with the direction and source of light from the moon, allowing the elements to integrate seamlessly into the starry night background. There are no apparent inconsistencies or conflicting light sources.",
