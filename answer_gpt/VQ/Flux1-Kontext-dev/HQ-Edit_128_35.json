      "question": "Is the typewriter’s keyboard area preserved with correct key layout and spacing, and does the body maintain a coherent rectangular form without warped edges or missing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter is part of the notebook cover design. The keyboard area is clearly visible, showing a recognizable layout with circular keys similar to traditional typewriters. The alignment and spacing appear consistent with what one would expect in a functional typewriter. The typewriter's body maintains a coherent rectangular form, indicating that it has not been warped or distorted through editing on the notebook cover. Observing these visual cues, it seems they have been preserved correctly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text \"Tales Untold\" positioned above the keyboard area without covering any functional parts of the typewriter, and does it follow a horizontal baseline consistent with the notebook’s orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Tales Untold' in Image B is placed prominently above the typewriter, positioned where it does not interfere with any functional parts such as the keys or paper. It follows a consistent horizontal alignment parallel to the top edge of the notebook cover, which suggests the text is oriented appropriately with respect to the design layout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ink splatters scattered irregularly across the surface, with varying sizes and soft edges, and do they not obscure important structural elements like the keys or paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, ink splatters are present above the typewriter and around the text. They are irregularly shaped with varying sizes and soft edges typical of an accidental spill or splash. These splatters do not cover important parts of the typewriter such as the keys or paper area, thus preserving clarity in those sections.",

      "question": "Does the marbled background continue evenly under the entire base of the notebook cover, with no visible gaps, clipping, or abrupt color shifts at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the notebook cover's background is designed to resemble a marbled surface. This pattern continues evenly across the visible areas and base of the notebook cover, maintaining a consistent textural flow and color scheme from edge to edge without breaks or abrupt changes. This helps in creating a coherent visual presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the leather spine show a consistent texture with slight color variation, and are the embossed key icons evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and shaded to suggest depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spine in Image B has a leather-like appearance with a consistent texture and slight variations in shade that suggest a natural variation typical in leather materials. The embossed elements on the spine appear evenly spaced, depicted with proper shapes and shading that creates an impression of depth, adding to the realism and tactile suggestion of the spine design.",
