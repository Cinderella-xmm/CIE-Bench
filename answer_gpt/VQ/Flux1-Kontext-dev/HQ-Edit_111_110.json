      "question": "Do the LEGO blocks forming the bookshelf and books have a uniform, smooth plastic texture throughout, with no residual wood grain or mixed material appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO blocks exhibit a smooth, uniform texture that is characteristic of plastic LEGO material. There are no visible signs of wood grain or any mixed materials, which are typical of a LEGO construction. The entire structure, including the bookshelf and books, lacks the variances in texture that would be indicative of wood or other materials, affirming the presence of a consistent plastic look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the LEGO blocks uniformly earthy-toned (e.g., browns, tans, dark reds) and consistent with the original bookshelfâ€™s color scheme, without any unexpected or jarring color deviations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO blocks are primarily earthy-toned, with a palette that includes browns, tans, and muted colors, which closely resemble the original bookshelf's color scheme. The colors in the LEGO version are consistent and do not include any unexpected or jarring deviations that would clash with the original look. This suggests a deliberate attempt to match the original tones in the LEGO representation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the darker LEGO bricks used for carvings clearly aligned and shaped to replicate the original decorative patterns on the spines and shelf edges without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks attempt to replicate the decorative patterns seen on the original bookshelf. However, due to the inherent limitations of LEGO blocks, the intricate carved details from Image A may not be perfectly replicated in the LEGO version. There could be slight misalignments or a lack of clear definition in replicating fine carvings due to the blocky nature of LEGO bricks. This would affect the precision of the patterns compared to the original.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the top of the LEGO tower taper smoothly and symmetrically from the base upward, without jagged edges, irregular steps, or disproportionate narrowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the LEGO tower in Image B shows a smooth and symmetrical tapering from the base upwards. The design emulates a pyramid-like shape with uniform steps, indicative of intentional LEGO construction. There are no jagged edges or irregular steps, and the narrowing appears proportionate and consistent, which suggests careful alignment and construction typical of LEGO builds.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background behind the LEGO tower completely plain and muted, with no traces of the original textured wallpaper or lighting artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be completely plain and muted, lacking any textured wallpaper or lighting artifacts that are present in Image A. The background is a simple, uniform color, likely to emphasize the LEGO bookshelf without introducing additional visual elements from the original scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all LEGO blocks aligned perfectly in rows and columns, with no gaps, overlaps, or floating pieces that disrupt the modular structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO blocks that form the bookshelf are aligned in a precise, modular fashion typical of LEGO builds. There are no visible gaps, overlaps, or floating pieces that would disrupt the structural integrity. Each block fits snugly in place, contributing to a cohesive and stable appearance, consistent with LEGO's designed modularity.",
