      "question": "Is the transparent showcase box fully aligned with the horseâ€™s outline and free from visual distortions such as warped edges, double images, or unnatural light refractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent showcase box appears to be aligned with the horse sculpture without visible distortions such as warped edges or double images. The horse is clearly visible within the box, suggesting proper alignment. Unnatural light refractions are not evident, indicating the box has been integrated well in terms of perspective and visual distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the showcase box have uniform color and reflective properties consistent with polished metal, without unnatural highlights or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold accents in Image B visually appear consistent with polished metal, showing a uniform color without evident highlights that would suggest material inconsistencies or errors in color rendering. There are no signs of color bleeding, and the accents maintain a steady reflective property throughout.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the internal backdrop pattern follow the correct perspective of the box and avoid warping, tiling errors, or partial cutoffs at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backdrop pattern inside the showcase box in Image B appears to follow the correct perspective, matching the edges of the box well. There is no noticeable warping or tiling errors, nor are there any partial cutoffs at the edges, ensuring the design is properly aligned within the box dimensions.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the magnetic closure mechanism visibly integrated into the box structure without gaps, overlaps, or floating components that suggest mechanical impossibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box structure does not visibly feature a magnetic closure mechanism. However, there are no visible gaps, overlaps, or floating components that suggest mechanical impossibility within the overall design. The box seems to integrate its components without structural issues.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse sculpture within the showcase box is fully visible, including the head, legs, saddle, and painted areas. The packaging elements do not obstruct any part of the sculpture, indicating that the integration into the box retains the full visibility of the sculpture's features.",
