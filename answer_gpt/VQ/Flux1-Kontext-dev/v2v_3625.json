      "question": "Are the textures of the ceramic mosaic tiles smooth and consistent without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures are smooth and consistent, which is typical of ceramic mosaic art since they are designed to show a cohesive appearance. The image depicts a flat, polished surface without any roughness or irregularities that are often deemed unnatural. This suggests a high-quality execution of mosaic tiles. The reason is supported by the visual smoothness seen on the map and pin representations, indicating an artifact-free application.",

      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the map and pins maintain their integrity without distortion in the ceramic mosaic tile artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the map's geographical features and pins emerge intact with clear boundaries and consistent sizing. Mosaic artworks must capture the essence of the original shapes, and here, each pin is distinctly identifiable and the map's contours are apparent, reflecting the desired geometric integrity. A further examination of Image A confirms the likeness in shape adherence, as there is no visible distortion or warping between the two images.",

      "question": "Are the colors of the ceramic mosaic tiles bold and harmonious, reflecting the original map's visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases strong vivid colors, harmonious and visually appealing, typical in ceramic mosaic tile artworks where bold palettes enhance aesthetic appeal. Comparing it to Image A, the map's colors are more vivid, yet still plausible as they follow a believable artistic interpretation of geographical zones and contours. This demonstrates an effective use of color in translating the map into mosaic form.",

      "question": "Have the fine details of the map and pins been preserved in the ceramic mosaic tile artwork without significant loss?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fine details such as the map's topography lines and pin shapes are clearly visible in Image B, indicating that they have been preserved effectively in the mosaic tile artwork. Upon comparing to Image A, the depiction holds the same level of detail, with map gradients and pin outlines kept consistent, showing no significant information loss during the transformation into mosaic medium.",

      "question": "Does the hand appear natural and undistorted while interacting with the ceramic mosaic tile artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand looks anatomically natural and proportionate, resembling a typical human hand interacting with a map. No distortion is evident in the hand's structure or its interaction with the ceramic mosaic tiles. This aligns with the natural presentation seen in Image A, confirming the integrity of the human form has been maintained throughout the artistic transition.",
