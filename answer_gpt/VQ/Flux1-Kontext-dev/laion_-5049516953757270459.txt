    "Question": "Q1: Does the LEGO representation of the avocado half retain a smooth, curved appearance with consistent brick alignment along its edge, avoiding jagged or broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edited representation of the avocado maintains a smooth and curved appearance typical of LEGO structures designed to mimic real objects. The bricks are carefully aligned along the edge to replicate the natural shape of an avocado half, avoiding any jagged or broken shapes, which is a common goal in LEGO construction to simulate realism. This analysis is based solely on the visual cues from Image B, where consistent curving can be observed, with the LEGO pieces forming a smooth edge.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the blueberries and raspberries represented with uniformly sized round LEGO bricks that maintain their individual spherical form without flattening or merging into irregular shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blueberries and raspberries are depicted using spherical LEGO pieces that closely resemble their real-world counterparts. These LEGO pieces are round and uniform, maintaining distinct separation between each piece. This accurate representation avoids any flattening or merging, demonstrating a clear understanding of individual spherical form through neatly arranged LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the LEGO broccoli maintain a layered, tree-like branching structure with distinct florets, avoiding overly simplified or collapsed geometry?",
    "explanation": "The broccoli in Image B is translated into LEGO with distinct layers and a tree-like branching structure, characteristic of real broccoli. Each floret is distinctly represented, avoiding any overly simplified or collapsed appearance. The use of multiple LEGO pieces and attention to detail allows this structure to be clearly layered and branched.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the surface of the LEGO red bell pepper smoothly curved with tightly fitted bricks, showing no visible gaps or abrupt angular transitions?",
    "explanation": "The red bell pepper in Image B is constructed with LEGO pieces to emulate its naturally curved shape. The bricks are tightly fitted to each other, creating a seamless, smooth surface. There are no abrupt angular transitions or visible gaps, demonstrating careful design consistent with LEGO models.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the outer edge of the LEGO heart-shaped board follow the exact contour of the original wooden board without deviations, breaks, or irregularities in shape?",
    "explanation": "The heart-shaped board in Image B uses LEGO pieces to trace the contour of the original board from Image A. Through the use of appropriately shaped LEGO pieces, the outer edge maintains a consistent and exact contour identical to the original heart shape. This ensures that there are no deviations, breaks, or irregularities along the edge.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the LEGO asparagus stalks aligned in parallel and bound together by a LEGO representation of twine, preserving the original bundle's structure and proportion?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the asparagus stalks are depicted in a parallel arrangement closely mimicking the way asparagus naturally bundle. The use of LEGO pieces adds a representation of twine binding them together, maintaining structural and proportional accuracy to the original bundle seen in the first image. This arrangement reflects a strong likeness to natural asparagus bundles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the LEGO heart-shaped board placed on a uniform gray base with no visible shadows, highlights, or texture inconsistencies that suggest mismatched lighting or depth?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the heart-shaped LEGO board placed on a uniform gray background, which lacks any texture or depth-related inconsistencies. The background is consistent without shadows or highlights that would suggest lighting mismatches, which is key to maintaining the visual focus on the LEGO constructs without unnecessary distractions from lighting or texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
