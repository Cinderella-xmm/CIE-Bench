      "question": "Is the glass cloche added over the pottery setup transparent, smoothly shaped, and free of visible artifacts such as jagged edges or distorted reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass cloche appears to be smoothly shaped and transparent, as it allows for a clear view of the objects inside without distortions. The reflections on the surface are consistent with a high-quality glass material, indicating a lack of jagged edges or warped reflections. There are no obvious artifacts, suggesting the cloche has been seamlessly added to the setup.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the clay pieces exhibit a uniform, realistic patina that blends naturally with their original gray tone without abrupt color shifts or artificial-looking highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clay pieces now sport a vibrant blue color, which contrasts sharply with the original gray tone seen in Image A. The color shift is abrupt and does not mimic a natural patina; it appears more as a paint coating, lacking any subtle shading or texture that would imply a realistic patina blend.",

      "question": "Are the miniature fairies proportionally scaled to the pottery and tools, positioned realistically on or near the table, and anatomically accurate with intact limbs and natural poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature fairies are correctly scaled relative to the pottery setup. They are positioned realistically on the grassy base near the table. The fairies have intact limbs and are in natural, playful poses, indicating accurate anatomical rendering consistent with typical fairy depictions.",

      "question": "Are the moss and tiny flowers placed along the edges of the wooden table with natural growth patterns and realistic textures, without covering critical structural components or appearing artificially pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moss and tiny flowers appear on the grassy base rather than directly on the wooden table. They are arranged around the edges in a manner that suggests natural growth patterns, enhancing the setup's visual appeal without obstructing any structural components. The texture is realistic and does not appear artificially pasted.",

      "question": "Is the wooden plaque attached securely to the base, correctly sized relative to the structure, and does it display clear, readable engravings without warping or unnatural surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wooden plaque attached to the base beneath the pottery setup. The plaque is proportionate to the overall size of the structure and displays clear, readable engravings, suggesting quality crafting. There is no visible warping or unnatural texture on the plaque surface, supporting its secure and appropriate attachment.",
