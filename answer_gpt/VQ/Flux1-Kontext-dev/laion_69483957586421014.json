    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the packaging box maintain correct proportions relative to the food processor, especially in alignment with the base and handle, without any distorted edges or warped geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the proportions of the packaging box appear to be consistent relative to the food processor. The box's rectangular shape is maintained without any visible distortions. The appliance appears to fit naturally within the box dimensions presented, and there are no apparent signs of warped geometry affecting the alignment of the handle, base, or surrounding edges. Comparing to Image A, the processor maintains its geometric integrity, suggesting proper proportions are preserved on the box.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the 'Waring' brand name clearly visible and properly aligned on the packaging without overlapping or distorting adjacent elements such as the appliance illustration or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand name 'Waring' is prominently displayed on the packaging box in larger font above the illustration and again at the base of the appliance graphic. It does not overlap or distort nearby elements like the appliance illustration or the background, maintaining its clarity and proper alignment. Comparing to Image A, where the brand name appears on the processor component itself, it retains the same clarity and position when transferred to packaging, indicating correct visual alignment and presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the isometric illustration of the food processor on the box accurately reflect the original object's geometry, including the feed tube, lid, and base, without distortion or incorrect angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When analyzing Image B, the isometric illustration shown on the packaging accurately reflects the food processor's geometry. The feed tube, lid, and base are depicted without distortion, maintaining consistent proportions and angles akin to the original food processor as seen in Image A. The alignment of the components such as handle and controls is correctly mirrored in the illustration, showcasing proper representation without any geometric errors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the exploded components of the food processor depicted with accurate shapes and positions, maintaining their original form and material texture without stretching or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the exploded view of the food processor components depicted on the packaging maintains the original form and material texture. The components such as the lid, base, and feed tube are accurately represented without visible stretching or blurring, showcasing the correct shapes and positions. Comparing to Image A, these components' inherent design and texture are replicated precisely in the exploded view on the box, suggesting the accuracy is maintained.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the metallic silver and matte black surfaces of the packaging display natural material finishes without unnatural reflections, graininess, or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the packaging displays metallic silver and matte black surfaces that appear to represent natural material finishes. These surfaces do not exhibit unnatural reflections, graininess, or texture artifacts. The texture is consistent with the real-world appearance of such materials, without any anomalies affecting the visual presentation. Compared to Image A, where these finishes exist on the actual appliance, Image B maintains the same visual quality in its representation on packaging.",
