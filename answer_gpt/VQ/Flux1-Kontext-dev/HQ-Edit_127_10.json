    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the upper and lower tiers clearly defined with consistent perspective and proportional scaling, and is there a visible separation between them that suggests a layered structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design within the glass sphere depicts the scene, including the Eiffel Towers and surrounding landscape, in a layered manner typically seen in snow globes. The transparency and the curvature of the glass create a separation between the elements inside and the exterior, suggesting a layered structure. The perspective within the glass may create an illusion of depth, supporting the perception of tiers.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the buildings in the upper tier have a metallic sheen with subtle reflections and gradients that match the lighting direction, and are there no flat or unnaturally uniform color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Eiffel Towers within the glass sphere maintain their metallic appearance with reflections and gradients that correspond to the lighting, giving them dimensionality. The rendering within the sphere avoids flat color patches, instead showing a dynamic range of tones that suggest metallic surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the trees and bushes in the lower tier composed of irregular, naturally shaped forms with varying heights and densities, and do they lack repeating texture tiles or unnatural symmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of trees and bushes inside the glass sphere in Image B shows natural forms with variations in height and density. The digitally created environment maintains irregularity in foliage shape and distribution, which avoids the appearance of repeating textures or symmetry, supporting a natural and varied landscape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the silvery flakes distributed across the space between tiers with soft edges, slight blurring, and depth-based opacity, indicating movement through air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe effect adds silvery flakes throughout the scene. These flakes show soft edges, slight blurring, and variance in opacity depending on their position, which suggests depth and movement through the air typical of such designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base show individually rendered cobblestones with visible grout lines and surface variations, and are the street lamps proportionally sized and evenly spaced along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cobblestone base supporting the glass sphere exhibits detailed rendering of each stone with visible grout lines and variations in surface textures. Street lamps within the sphere's scene are proportionally sized and spaced in a manner consistent with a real urban layout. This suggests attention to detail and proportional accuracy in the depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are both Eiffel Towers structurally intact with correct lattice patterns, uniform scaling, and no stretched or compressed sections that deviate from their known design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Eiffel Towers within the sphere in Image B maintain structural integrity, correct lattice patterns, and uniform scaling reflecting their known design features. The art within the glass retains these elements without distortion, presenting accurate representations of the towers.",
