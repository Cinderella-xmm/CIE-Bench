      "question": "Does the chibi knight maintain consistent metallic texture across the armor, with no visible warping or unnatural smoothing of surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knight's armor in Image B appears to have consistent metallic texture across its surface. The armor shows reflections and sheen characteristic of polished metal. There are no visible parts where the texture seems warped or unnaturally smooth, indicating that the texture has been applied uniformly.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass dome visually coherent, with clear edges and realistic light refraction, and does it enclose all elements without intersecting or clipping through them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the glass dome has well-defined edges and realistic light refraction and reflections, which gives the impression of a real, transparent material. Common knowledge of glass domes suggests clear visibility and rounded edges. The dome enclosures all elements under it without observable intersections or clipping, maintaining visual coherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shield retain its embossed lion design and metallic sheen, with no visible loss of fine detail or unnatural flatness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shield retains its intricate embossed lion design and metallic sheen. The detailing of the lion and the texture of the shield surface are clear and distinct, showing no signs of flattening or loss of detail. Such embossing typically holds its detail if accurately edited.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sheep proportionally small compared to the knight, with natural wool texture and anatomically correct forms, and are they positioned on the ground without floating or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows sheep much smaller compared to the knight, aligning with common proportions where animals are smaller relative to human figures. They have natural-looking wool texture, adding realism, and their anatomical form is correct. They are positioned on the base without floating or clipping through the surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dragonâ€™s body form a continuous, non-intersecting curve around the turret, with consistent scaly texture and no visible gaps or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have a dragon featured, instead, there is a fox. Therefore, analyzing Image B alone, the prompt regarding the dragon's curve and texture does not apply. The response must reflect awareness that the correct representation does not include a dragon.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
