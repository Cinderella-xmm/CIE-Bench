      "question": "Does the character's face retain its natural proportions and features without any visible distortion or unnatural textures after being rendered in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face area in Image B is deliberately blurred, rendering any analysis regarding its proportions and features impossible. Since this question pertains specifically to facial features, we must deduce that the rendering in a 3D cartoon style has likely affected the visibility or clarity of these features in a way that makes them not recognizable, coherent, or natural.Assuming any intentional blurring often results in loss of natural proportions and clarity.",
