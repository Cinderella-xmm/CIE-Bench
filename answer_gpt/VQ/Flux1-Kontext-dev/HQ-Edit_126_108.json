      "question": "Do the cascading arms and legs of the water elemental follow natural water flow patterns without abrupt breaks or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the water elemental's arms and legs exhibit a fluid motion characteristic of natural water flow. The twisting and swirling motifs mimic how water might cascade over an edge, maintaining the organic curves found in nature, which avoids abrupt breaks or unrealistic bending. The visual cues suggest a fluidity and continuity typical of natural water movements.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the crystalline textures on the cliff faces varied in shape and size, and do they appear embedded within the rock rather than overlaid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cliff faces have no visible crystalline textures; instead, they resemble a natural rock surface where the focus is on the earthy tones and rugged formations typical of a cliff. Therefore, since there is no clear evidence of crystalline textures, the indication is that they are neither varied nor embedded.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the glowing azure pattern emit a soft, diffused light that interacts with the surrounding rock and water without harsh edges or over-bright spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing azure light from the elemental's form appears soft and interacts subtly with the surroundings, enhancing the scene without detracting from the natural landscape. The design avoids harsh edges or exceedingly bright spots, giving a smoothly diffused light effect enhancing the elemental's ethereal presence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the mist and leaf crown transition smoothly from the solid canopy and appear anchored to the landscape with consistent depth and motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the mist blending smoothly around the waterfall and elemental without abrupt changes or disjunctions. The leaf crown transition maintains consistency with the natural setting, integrating seamlessly from the canopy to the landscape, suggesting depth and continuity without disjointed elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the whirlpool eyes properly sized, located in a logical position within the waterfall, and do they show realistic spiral motion and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water elemental features whirlpool-like eyes; however, the eyes are not directly positioned within the waterfall itself, nor do they exhibit a spiral motion. The eyes appear part of the elemental structure, not demonstrating any typical whirlpool dynamics or realistic depth associated with water movement.",
