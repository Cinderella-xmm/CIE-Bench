      "question": "Are the details and textures of the skateboarder and the urban background preserved despite the application of the faded effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a faded effect due to the overall presentation resembling a Polaroid photo. Despite this effect, the primary details and textures of the skateboarder and urban background remain visible. The skateboarder is clear enough to identify his outfit, the skateboard is distinguishable, and details of the urban background, such as buildings and trees, can still be discerned, although they are naturally less sharp compared to non-faded imagery due to the faded effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the white border and text \"11:13 AM\" blend naturally into the image without introducing any visual distractions or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white border is a common feature in Polaroid-style presentations and it frames the image consistently. The text \"11:13 AM\" is placed in a typical Polaroid style location below the image. This placement is harmonious with the overall aesthetic and does not introduce visual distractions or unnatural breaks; it appears part of the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the paper-like grain texture applied uniformly across the image without causing noticeable loss of detail or introduction of unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The paper-like grain texture in Image B is subtle and uniform, a characteristic seen in Polaroid images to mimic the physical texture of photographic paper. This effect does not interfere significantly with the visibility of details and does not introduce unnatural patterns that could disrupt the natural flow or features of the image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical relationships between the skateboarder, the skateboard, and the background elements remain consistent and logical after applying the Polaroid effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The application of the Polaroid effect in Image B does not alter the proportions of the skateboarder, the skateboard, or their spatial relationship with the background elements. The dimensions and relative positions appear consistent, maintaining logical proportions and physical relationships found in the original scenario.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the edges of the skateboarder and the skateboard smooth and free from any unnatural artifacts or distortions resulting from the editing process?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the edges of both the skateboarder and the skateboard seem well-defined and free from any distracting artifacts or distortions caused by the application of the Polaroid effect. The edits have retained smoothness, without introducing jagged edges or visual noise.",
