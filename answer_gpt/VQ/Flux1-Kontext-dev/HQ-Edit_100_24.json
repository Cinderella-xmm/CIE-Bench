    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the robe's fabric show natural folds and creases consistent with silk material, and are the dragon and floral embroidery patterns continuous and free from jagged edges or missing stitches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the robe appears to have a smooth surface that suggests the sheen and flow characteristic of silk, a commonly understood property attributed to this material. The dragon and floral embroidery patterns demonstrate continuity, with lines and shapes looking well-defined and connected, without any jagged edges which can indicate missing stitches or poor pattern design. The visual consistency aligns with a common understanding that high-quality embroidery and fabric should appear smooth and continuous.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the jade accessories (such as necklace or earrings) display realistic translucency, soft highlights, and subtle internal refraction, and are they properly attached to the body without floating or clipping through skin or clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jade accessories in image B display characteristics such as a gentle sheen and subtle coloration changes, indicative of translucency and internal refraction commonly associated with realistic gemstones. The positioning of these accessories relative to the body and clothing avoids any unnatural appearance such as floating or clipping, which would detract from realism. Understanding realistic gemstone properties assists in determining the quality of rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the extended hairstyle anatomically plausible with natural volume and flow, and do the jade hairpins sit securely within the hair without floating, intersecting, or causing unnatural bulges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hairstyle in image B displays a smooth and flowing structure that corresponds with common notions of plausibility in hair volume and flow. The jade hairpins appear securely positioned, without any signs of floating, intersecting, or causing distortions in hair placement, which would indicate a lack of realism. Observing hair movement and accessory positioning provides insight into realistic hair styling and accessory attachment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background feature clearly visible classical Chinese scrolls with consistent lighting, depth, and color harmony (rich reds, golds, deep greens), and does it blend seamlessly with the subject without abrupt edges or mismatched shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the background consists of classical Chinese scrolls that exhibit consistent lighting enhancing depth and color harmony among shades of red, gold, and green. The backdrop integrates smoothly with the subject through congruent shadowing that avoids sudden transitions, thus promoting visual cohesion. Understanding ideographic elements and harmonizing colors aids in assessing seamless integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are both hands fully visible with exactly five fingers each, natural finger spacing and curvature, and no signs of fusion, extra digits, or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the hands are depicted with a natural amount of care in detailing, all fingers being clearly visible with natural spacing and curvature. Examination of the fingers in terms of spacing and general anatomy corresponds to the conventional understanding of no aberrations found in either extra digits or unnatural bending, indicating correct anatomical replication.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the embroidery threads, jade surface textures, and scroll calligraphy sharp and clear, without visible pixelation, smudging, or artificial edge enhancement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The images reflect high resolution where embroidery, jade textures, and calligraphy are shown without any signs of pixelation or artificial manipulation such as edge enhancement affecting sharpness or clarity. Visibility maintains a coherent presentation with an absence of smudging, supporting the understanding that high-quality rendering should appear unblemished and distinct.",
