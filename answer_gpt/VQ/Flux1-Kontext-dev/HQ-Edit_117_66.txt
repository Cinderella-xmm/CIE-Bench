    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges of the jigsaw pieces smooth and interlocking without gaps or overlapping deformities?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show several jigsaw pieces scattered around the book. Each piece appears designed with typical puzzle piece contours characterized by smooth edges that are meant to interlock seamlessly when joined. There are no noticeable gaps or overlapping deformities visible, suggesting proper interlocking design typical in jigsaw puzzles. Based on puzzle manufacturing standards, these characteristics are expected.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the dragon patterns appear in darker wood stain and the compass area in lighter wood stain, with no abrupt or unnatural color transitions?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows dragon patterns prominently featured in a darker hue compared to the rest, which aligns with common design practices where intricate details are highlighted with darker stains to enhance depth. The compass area, being central and typically emphasized, appears lighter, providing contrast against the dragons. There are no visible abrupt color changes or shifts that would suggest unnatural transitions, indicating a harmonious color balance between these elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the wood grain texture visible and naturally varied across all puzzle pieces, without repeating patterns or artificial smoothing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scattered jigsaw pieces have visually discernible wood grain textures. These textures vary naturally across different pieces, which is characteristic of authentic wooden items as natural grain differs across cuts. There is no evidence of repeating patterns or smoothly artificial textures on any of the pieces, adhering to a natural and varied look as expected.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the puzzle pieces arranged in a physically plausible scattered layout on the wooden surface, with no floating or overlapping pieces that defy gravity or perspective?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays puzzle pieces scattered around a book on a flat surface. The pieces are positioned in a manner that realistically reflects how loose puzzle pieces would appear when placed on a flat surface, without floating or overlapping that would typically defy acceptable gravity or viewpoint conventions. No pieces give the impression of being unrealistic in their placement, supporting a plausible layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the central compass retain its circular shape and fine internal details, with no distortion or loss of precision in the engraved lines and divisions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central compass maintains its distinctive circular shape with intricate engraved lines and divisions clearly visible. These elements reflect precision work typical of items designed to showcase elaborate craftmanship. No distortions or loss of detail is evident, supporting a well-preserved image of the compass in terms of accuracy in its details.",
    "answer": "Yes"
