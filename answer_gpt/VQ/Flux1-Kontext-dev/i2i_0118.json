      "question": "Does the character seamlessly integrate into the tablet screen without any visible gaps or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted as jumping out of a tablet. The integration is depicted with the character slightly above the tablet. The character does not touch the tablet screen directly, hence there are no visible gaps or edge artifacts where the character meets the screen. The effect is intended to portray the character emerging from the screen rather than being part of it. By visual analysis, the character does not integrate seamlessly into the screen, following typical depictions of characters appearing to jump out of a device.",

      "question": "Are the character's arms positioned naturally as if reaching out, without any distortion or unusual angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's arms are raised and extended sideways in a classic pose of reaching out or celebrating, which is typical of animated characters showing excitement. There is no visible distortion or unnatural angles when observing the arms' positioning. The proportions and positions appear consistent with how arms are typically portrayed in animated figures during active stances.",

      "question": "Do the character's legs extend naturally from the tablet, maintaining proper proportions and avoiding any broken or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character's legs as slightly bent, giving the impression of motion associated with jumping. The legs have natural curves and maintain the typical proportions of the character design, with no visible distortion or broken shapes. They are positioned above the tablet as part of the character popping up, which is logically coherent given the scenario depicted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the character's facial expression remained consistent, without any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial expression in Image B reflects an enthusiastic and joyful demeanor, which aligns with the usual portrayals of this character. The expression includes a wide-open mouth and visible eyes, detailed and consistent with animated character design. The textures maintain an animated style, avoiding any unnatural elements that could detract from the character's typical appearance. Thus, based on visual characteristics, there is no loss of detail or addition of unnatural textures.",

      "question": "Does the tablet fit naturally within the composition of the image, contributing to a coherent and authentic interactive entertainment effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tablet is depicted below the character, suggesting the character emerging from it. The tablet's design is realistic in comparison to typical touch devices, and its placement contributes to the illusion of interactive entertainment. The shadow on the screen adds depth and context, enhancing the visual effect of interaction between the device and character. Thus, the visual composition and element integration create a coherent overall impression that fits within an entertainment realm.",
