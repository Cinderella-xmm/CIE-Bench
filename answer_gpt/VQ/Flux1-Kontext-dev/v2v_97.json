      "question": "Does the bag character retain its original earthy tones, leather straps, and structural design without introducing unnatural textures or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag character maintains its earthy tones, leather straps, and overall structural integrity that were present in Image A. The illustration has been stylized into a cartoon/comic format, but it retains all key visual elements such as color scheme and design. No unnatural textures or loss of fine details are apparent, ensuring continuity from Image A.",

      "question": "Has the bowl character been transformed in a way that maintains its original proportions and avoids any geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bowl character appears to be consistent with its original form seen in Image A. It retains its round shape and proportions, and there are no apparent geometric distortions introduced in the translation to a cartoon style. This indicates that the bowl's transformation preserved its physical characteristics.",

      "question": "Do the expressions and actions of the bag and bowl characters in both panels feel natural and consistent with the described scenarios without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the bag and the bowl characters are inanimate objects and do not have expressions or actions as typical animated characters might. However, they are placed in the scene naturally with the context provided by the speech bubbles. This gives life to the scene while maintaining a logical and consistent appearance. There are no unnatural artifacts disrupting the sceneâ€™s continuity or logic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the cat-like attributes added to the bag character integrated seamlessly with the original design without disrupting the overall structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bag character in Image B does not have additional cat-like attributes. It retains its original design from Image A, focusing purely on the earthy tone and construction of the bag without any additional features such as ears, whiskers, or a tail that would be indicative of cat-like attributes. This ensures that the original design remains seamless and without disruption.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the positioning and movement of the bowl character in Panel 2 physically logical and maintains the integrity of the scene without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both panels in Image B, the bowl character remains static, retaining its position and proportions from its depiction in Image A. There is no visible movement of the bowl in Panel 2, and therefore, it does not disrupt the scene or introduce unnatural artifacts. It is logically positioned in context with the surrounding elements.",
