    "Question": "Q1: Does the lime wedge retain its natural green hue and textured rind, with no visible distortion or pixelation, even after being shaped into a smiling cap?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lime wedge is transformed into an exaggerated smiling face with a hat shape. Despite this change, the lime maintains a recognizable green hue and retains its textured rind. The alteration to create a hat does not visually distort its natural appearance beyond acceptable transformations for cartoon or stylized imagery. Considering the artistic representation, these changes do not exhibit pixelation or significant distortion while maintaining the basic characteristic of a lime.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the two ice cubes positioned as eyes clearly defined as solid, translucent cubes with sharp edges and no deformation, and do they sit naturally within the liquid without appearing to float unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ice cubes are styled as eyes for the cartoon face. This artistic interpretation alters their appearance from mere frozen water to cartoonish features. While they maintain a block-like shape appropriate for ice cubes, their representation as 'eyes' implies a floating or unnatural positioning typical of cartoon illustrations. The cubes lack the sharp definition typical of realistic ice within a glass.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the sugar rim along the glass edge uniformly granular and continuous, with no visible breaks, smearing, or artificial coloring that disrupts the natural appearance of salt/sugar crystals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sugar rim is designed as part of the cartoon attribute stylizing the drink. The illustration prioritizes simplicity and uniformity over realistic granularity that the original suggests in Image A. There's no explicit texture of sugar crystals; rather, the rim is uniformly colored and stylized to fit the animated theme, disregarding the granular detail of natural sugar.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the sombrero and maracas have consistent material textures (e.g., woven straw, wood grain, reflective beads), correct scale relative to the glass, and proper shadows that match the lighting direction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, sombrero and maracas are rendered in a cartoon style. Thereâ€™s no depiction of woven straw or wood grain as would be expected in realistic items. Instead, they are colored uniformly without texture variation. The cartoon does not use realistic shadows or scale fidelity as seen in detailed illustrations; the focus is more on stylized, flat illustrations lacking consistent realistic material texture.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the confetti pieces varied in color and shape, with soft edges and subtle shadows, and do they appear to lie on the surface without floating or overlapping unrealistically?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the confetti is characterized by bright colors and varied shapes typical of festive illustrations. However, they do not exhibit shadows or realistic spatial positioning, as they float against the backdrop of the image rather than 'lying' on any surface. The emphasis is on vibrancy and cartoon aesthetics, aiming for an overall festive appearance rather than a realistic representation.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the text 'Fiesta Time!' clearly visible, evenly spaced, and positioned at the top of the image without overlapping or distorting other elements, and does it have consistent stroke width and anti-aliasing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Fiesta Time!' is prominently displayed at the top. The stroke width is consistent and there is clear anti-aliasing, enhancing visibility and smoothness. The text does not overlap with other elements and is well-positioned for readability without distortion, fitting the festive theme adequately.",
    "answer": "Yes"
