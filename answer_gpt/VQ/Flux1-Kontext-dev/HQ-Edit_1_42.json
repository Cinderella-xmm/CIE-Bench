      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cartoon version of the man have correctly proportioned limbs, five fingers per hand, and natural joint angles without bending or elongation errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts cartoon versions of a man holding a newspaper. In cartoons, proportions can be exaggerated, but within the context of the caricature style used, the man's limbs appear properly proportioned. The hands, however, do not clearly show five fingers; they seem simplified, which is often a stylistic choice in cartoons. The joint angles look natural given the stylized depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the swirling leaves positioned in a way that follows logical airflow paths and do not intersect or pass through the manâ€™s body or bench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves are depicted swirling around the man in a decorative manner. They are placed against the background, maintaining their position around the man without overlapping his body. The placement suggests a stylized arrangement, typical for a cartoon without indicating literal airflow effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tree canopies and foliage display consistent color distribution and intact branching structures without visible breaks or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foliage in Image B shows fall colors with orange, red, and yellow leaves surrounding the man. The colors are uniformly applied, consistent with traditional cartoon styles. The branches and foliage don't show any breaks or misalignment; they follow a pattern typical of cartoon backgrounds.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cream-colored paper background uniformly textured and do the tree branch motifs lie flat without distortion, clipping, or unnatural shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cream-colored background in Image B presents a plain backdrop that complements the cartoon characters and motifs. The tree branches appear integrated into the background clearly and cleanly, without clipping or distortion. The lack of shadows aligns with the simple, flat cartoon style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the elements (man, leaves, bench, paper border) arranged within clear margins and aligned symmetrically or logically to suggest a bounded page layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements are framed within a border that suggests a coherent, bounded layout, typical of a cartoon strip or card design. They are aligned in a way that balances the composition visually, with leaves symmetrically surrounding the man for artistic effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all surfaces (clothing, skin, leaves, paper) rendered with consistent sharpness and texture detail without jagged lines, smudging, or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a simplified cartoon style where surfaces are meant to look flat and not overly detailed. The rendering style inherently lacks realistic texture detail and sharpness intentionally. However, the elements are clearly defined and free of visual artifacts like jagged lines or smudging, fitting within the expectations of cartoon rendering.",
