      "question": "Does the airplane maintain its structural consistency despite being transformed into a stylized 3D cartoon version with chibi features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane is transformed into a chibi-style 3D cartoon with exaggerated and stylized features such as oversized eyes and a smiling mouth. While its structure is cartoonishly altered, the fundamental airplane form is maintained, including wings and engines, albeit in a whimsical style. Thus, it retains its recognizable structure as an airplane in this artistic rendition.",

      "question": "Are the festive red hues and golden motifs integrated seamlessly into the airplane's design without appearing unnatural or out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane features vibrant red hues and intricate golden motifs, which are characteristic of festive designs, especially those related to Chinese celebrations.

      "question": "Do the tassels hanging from the wings and the \"囍\" symbol on the tail appear natural and well-integrated into the image without causing any visual distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane does not actually have tassels hanging from the wings nor a '囍' symbol evident on the tail. The elements present that may be confused with tassels are actually the hanging lanterns in the sky. The integration of the cartoon elements appears seamless, with no evident distortion resulting from such additions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunset provides a warm, golden backdrop while the floating Chinese lanterns add a cultural and festive touch. They integrate smoothly into the sky without disrupting the image's overall aesthetic or causing any visual inconsistencies, thereby enhancing the festive theme.",

      "question": "Have the fine details of the airplane and background been preserved without noticeable loss or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation in Image B involves converting the airplane into a cartoon with chibi features, resulting in a deliberate loss of realistic details for stylistic reasons. The background elements such as the runway and the sky are simplified but retain a coherent appearance. This style does not introduce unintended unnatural textures; rather, it is a purposeful artistic choice to achieve the desired cartoonish effect.",
