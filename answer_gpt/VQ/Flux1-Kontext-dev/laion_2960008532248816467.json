      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and smile drawn on the yellow surface of the front tart smooth, consistent in color with the surrounding custard, and free from jagged edges or unnatural texture disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and smile on the tart are drawn in a cartoonish style, blending naturally with the custard in terms of color and texture. There are no visible jagged edges or disruptions that would suggest an unnatural addition. The smoothness and consistency of the lines and colors maintain the visual coherence of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the forest creatures on the crust rim appear proportionally small, properly aligned with the curve of the crust, and have soft, coherent textures without visible pixelation or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The forest creatures in Image B are small enough to fit on the crust and each aligns with the curve, suggesting intentional placement. The creatures are drawn with a level of detail consistent with soft textures, maintaining a quality that avoids pixelation or clipping artifacts. Their cartoonish style blends into the whimsical setting.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the swirling path extend smoothly from the base of the front tart into the background, with consistent shading and perspective, and without sharp edges or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The path in Image B begins at the base of the tart and flows into the background smoothly as part of the imagined whimsical setting. The shading and perspective are consistent, suggesting a continuous path without abrupt transitions or floating segments, which enhances the harmony of the landscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the green foliage and pastel flowers positioned around the tart at a realistic distance, with proper shadowing and no overlapping or clipping onto the tartâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foliage and flowers are arranged around the tart, maintaining a realistic distance that complements the scene's fantasy element. There is no overlapping or clipping onto the tart, and shadowing is consistent with the imagined light source, integrating them naturally into the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the two tarts retain their original shape, size, and layered structure (crust, custard, top glaze), with only non-destructive additions applied, and are there no distortions such as warped edges or missing layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The front tart in Image B preserves its original shape, size, and layered structure from Image A. The crust, custard, and glaze are intact, with added illustrations and whimsical elements overlaid without destructively altering the tart's form. There are no visible distortions or missing layers, indicating careful editing.",
