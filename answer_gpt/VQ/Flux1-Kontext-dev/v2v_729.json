      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand in Image B holding the badge is depicted with fingers that appear naturally shaped, with realistic proportions and details.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the integration of the badge does not alter the spatial arrangement or structural consistency of the depicted landmarks. The surrounding elements appear consistent and uninterrupted, while the badge serves as a container for the scene rather than disrupting it.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
