    {

      "question": "Are the golden batik patterns on the dancer's dress clearly defined, continuous, and free from pixelation or jagged edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's dress features orangish-red patterns that appear smooth and continuous without signs of pixelation. The use of solid colors and defined outlines suggests a quality, line-art representation. Image A features more complex gold patterns, whereas Image B simplifies these into line art, maintaining clarity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the line-drawn version of the temple maintain accurate tier alignment and structural symmetry without missing or distorted roof layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a line-art version of the temple with clearly drawn tiers that appear symmetrical and aligned accurately. The structure in Image B maintains the tiered design similar to the original Image A, capturing the essence of the temple’s architecture with all tiers appearing evenly layered and correctly aligned.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the two guardian statues on either side of the pathway identical in size, pose, and position relative to the central temple axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guardian statues flanking the pathway appear to be similar in size, pose, and position, maintaining symmetry with respect to the temple's central axis. The line art preserves the structural positioning as seen in Image A, reinforcing the symmetrical positioning found in typical temple architecture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do both of the dancer’s hands show five fingers each with natural spacing, smooth contours, and no deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the dancer's hands with enough clarity in the line-art style to show five fingers each with natural spacing and smooth contours. Although simplified, the representation avoids any deformation and maintains the correct number of digits.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text positioned in a way that does not overlap or obscure the dancer, temple, or guardian statues, and is it clearly readable without visual clutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the text 'BALI'S MAJESTIC LEGACY' above the temple, separate from the main visual elements like the dancer and statues, ensuring it does not overlap or obscure these elements. The text is presented clearly with ample space, avoiding clutter.",
