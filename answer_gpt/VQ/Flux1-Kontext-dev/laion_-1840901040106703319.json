    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the crystal facets on the cabin’s walls, roof, and windows evenly shaped and aligned with the original cabin’s triangular and rectangular outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure has been transformed into a crystal form with facets that follow geometric shapes like triangles or rectangles, reminiscent of the original cabin's architecture in Image A that features triangular and rectangular elements. The facets in Image B conform to similar proportions and placements as the original design, indicating that the transformation preserved the alignment and shape from the original outline.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the blue and green hues on the crystal surfaces show variations in transparency and light reflection consistent with real glass or crystal, rather than uniform solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal surfaces display variations in tones of blue and green, suggesting depth and changing light reflection across the facets, characteristic of real glass or crystal. This is reinforced by the way light interacts and reflects off the surfaces, avoiding a monotonous color palette.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the vertical support beams and horizontal railings converted into crystal forms that maintain their original spacing, height, and alignment with the cabin’s frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the structure as entirely crystal with no clear demarcations of beams or railings. The transformation into a crystal form does not show distinct support beams or railings as in Image A. Thus, there's a lack of visible alignment identical to traditional framing elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white marble platform beneath the cabin flat, continuous, and free of cracks or irregularities, and does it extend evenly under the entire base of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a white marble platform is seen beneath the crystal structure. It appears smooth, unbroken, and expansive, covering the base without visible imperfections. This uniformity suggests that the platform is flat and continuous under the entire crystal structure, indicating careful design and execution.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the small crystal formations along the base of the cabin proportionally smaller than the main structure, grouped in clusters, and positioned in a way that suggests natural growth rather than random placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, smaller crystal clusters are positioned near the base of the main crystal structure. Their size is noticeably smaller, and they are aggregated in clusters, mirroring organic growth patterns seen in nature and reinforcing the sense of intentional placement rather than a disorderly arrangement.",
