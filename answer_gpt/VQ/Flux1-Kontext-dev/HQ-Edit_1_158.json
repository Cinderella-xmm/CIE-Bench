    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the silhouette of the woman maintain correct anatomical proportions and avoid geometric distortions such as misaligned limbs, unnatural bends, or missing body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the woman is a stylized and artistic depiction rather than a realistic portrayal. The figure features a head, shoulders, and arms holding a book in a manner that fits common visual interpretations of human shapes, particularly in silhouetted art. Despite the lack of detailed anatomical features, the proportions appear correct within the context of a silhouette, as the form is designed to capture the essence rather than precise anatomical representation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the enlarged book proportionally consistent with the womanâ€™s hands and arms, and does it not appear to float or clip through the chair or body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is part of the silhouetted design, with the contour of the book seamlessly connecting to the figure's arms, as often seen in silhouettes. There's no indication of floating or clipping due to the nature of silhouette design, which simplifies elements to avoid such complexities. Compared to Image A, the shape of the book and its interaction with the hands have been abstracted while maintaining proportional consistency within this artistic style.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lace details on the sweater seamlessly integrated with the original knit texture, showing no signs of unnatural edges, repeating patterns, or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detailing on the attire appears through the use of silhouette art rather than realistic textures. The design contains intricate patterns within the silhouette, which are representative of artistic lace or embroidery work. This method avoids issues of edge inconsistency or repeating patterns as it is inherently different from a photo-realistic texture integration scenario seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the simplified bookshelves maintain coherent shelf structure with aligned edges and realistic spacing between books, avoiding floating or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict bookshelves within its contents. Unlike the realistic depiction in Image A with numerous books in a library setting, Image B focuses on an abstract and minimalistic representation involving a woman and book silhouette, eliminating the need for bookshelf representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the antique-gold cardstock background uniformly textured and lit, with no abrupt edges or lighting mismatches that separate it from the central figure and other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a consistent antique-gold appearance, typical for a vintage paper or cardstock texture. This portrayal supports visual uniformity and avoids abrupt edges or lighting mismatches, as the silhouette on top of this background is designed for contrast, making the entirety of Image B appear harmonious and integrated.",
