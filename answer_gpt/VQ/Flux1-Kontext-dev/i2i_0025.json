      "question": "Does the womanâ€™s face exhibit natural contours and shading without visible unnatural textures or blotches in the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor effect is applied uniformly, and while it simplifies details, it maintains a smooth texture with soft shading that fits the watercolor medium. The transformation does not introduce unnatural textures, as the watercolor style embraces blending and smooth gradient transitions, providing a natural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the background figures appropriately simplified with light lines and washes, avoiding unnatural geometric breaks or inconsistencies in their form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, the background figures have been simplified as is typical with watercolor transformations. They are depicted with light lines and subtle washes that effectively maintain their form without introducing geometric breaks. In watercolor, such simplifications are common and appropriate, contributing to a cohesive art style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the woman's hand holding the wine glass composed of five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, avoiding unnatural artifacts or shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hand is depicted in a watercolor style where the contours and spacing of the fingers appear naturally rounded and appropriately spaced. The artistic style retains the integrity of the hand's shape without introducing awkward or unnatural artifacts, consistent with how hands are often simplified in watercolor art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wine glass appear transparent with subtle reflections, consistent with its real-life properties, without losing fine details or becoming overly stylized in the watercolor transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wine glass retains an appearance of transparency, which is emphasized by the watercolor's subtle use of reflection and shading. This ensures that the glass does not lose its essential fine details and avoids becoming overly stylized, maintaining a realistic balance within the watercolor framework.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and interactions between the woman, her glass, and the table appear consistent with lighting and spatial positioning, avoiding any visual distortion or floating effects after the watercolor transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor effect has been applied in a way that ensures the shadows and interactions among the woman, the glass, and the table remain consistent with the lighting sources and spatial positioning. The integration of these elements in the watercolor transformation avoids distortions or floating effects, adhering to a realistic portrayal within the artistic medium.",
