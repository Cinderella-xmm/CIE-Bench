      "question": "Are the cat's limbs and body proportions appropriate for its new lounging pose on the sofa without appearing unnaturally distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the cat is lounging comfortably on the sofa with its body proportions and limb positions appearing natural for this relaxed posture. This conclusion is based on the visual cues, where the cat's front paws are neatly placed in front of its body and its hind legs are in a typical lounging position parallel to the body, reflecting a common feline pose. This arrangement suggests that the proportions are suitable and not distorted.",

      "question": "Do the glasses on the cat's face fit naturally and are they free from any visible artifacts such as unnatural texture or alignment issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glasses on the cat appear to be properly aligned with the face and sit naturally over the areas where the eyes would be located. The lack of noticeable misalignment or texture issues implies that the glasses were integrated well into the scene. The proportion and positioning of the glasses correspond with the typical placement of eyewear on such a subject, suggesting no glaring artifacts.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the cat and the living room background smooth, with no distracting edges or mismatches in lighting and shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the image, the cat blends seamlessly into the living room setting. The lighting on the cat matches the warm, ambient lighting in the room, and there are no jagged edges or stark contrasts at the boundaries where the cat meets the sofa. This suggests a smooth transition without visible distractions or discrepancies in the visuals.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the remote control look naturally placed, with fingers appropriately positioned around the remote, avoiding any anatomical distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the image, the cat's paw is holding the remote control, positioned in a way that mimics how a human hand would hold it. Since a cat's paw does not have fingers, I will reinterpret it as a paw seamlessly resting alongside a remote, natural for this imaginative context. There is no appearance of anatomical distortion in this setting, indicating a cleverly adjusted grasp for the scenario.",

      "question": "Are the colors and materials used for the cat, the sofa, and the living room consistent and harmonious, contributing to an overall authentic and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in the image are cohesive, with the cat's fur tone complementing the brown shade of the sofa. The living room's warm, muted colors and soft textures harmonize with the setting. The lighting appears consistent across the scene, adding to the authenticity and natural feel of the environment.",
