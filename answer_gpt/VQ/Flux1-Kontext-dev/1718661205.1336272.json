      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the LEGO version of the military ship maintain its original shape and structural proportions without visible distortions or misaligned brick patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO version of the military ship shows well-aligned brick patterns. The ship maintains its original shape to a high degree, with no visible distortions. The proportionate structure is evident from the balanced and recognizable layout, similar to Image A's background ship structure, but LEGO stylized.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the LEGO-rendered ocean waves shaped in a way that mimics natural wave motion, without appearing overly rigid or uniformly flat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO-rendered ocean waves use bricks to create a pattern that simulates wave motion rather than being overly rigid or flat. The variability in brick placement and color suggests movement and depth, mimicking ocean waves.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the LEGO accessories used for the boat deck properly scaled and positioned to match the size and perspective of the character and the surrounding scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO accessories on the boat deck, while stylized, seem to be proportionally scaled and appropriately placed. They match the overall perspective and size of the LEGO character and fit coherently within the scene's context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the LEGO-textured life vest and shirt retain their original colors and show no signs of unnatural texture repetition, pixelation, or mismatched edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the life vest and shirt are recreated using LEGO bricks, retaining the color scheme from the real scene. The textures are consistent and there are no signs of unnatural repetition, pixelation, or mismatched edges, maintaining a cohesive appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO model positioned on a shelf that appears structurally sound and spatially coherent, with appropriate shadows and depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model sits on a shelf that appears structurally sound. The proportions are logical, and the shadows and depth cues are appropriately rendered to give the impression of a physical display. The framing is consistent with real-life displays, suggesting spatial coherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, misaligned bricks, or missing pieces in the LEGO model that break the illusion of a cohesive construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model shows no visible artifacts like jagged lines or misaligned bricks. The construction appears cohesive, with each brick positioned correctly, contributing to a smoothly integrated design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
