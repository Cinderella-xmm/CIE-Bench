      "question": "Are the golden embroidery patterns on the central figure's dress consistent in texture and detail, showing no signs of artificial edges or repetitive digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden embroidery patterns on the dress in Image B should reflect realistic and continuous details, without abrupt edges or digital patterns that repeat unnaturally. In Image B, the embroidery appears smooth and consistent in texture, similar to what would be expected from handcrafted details, suggesting mindful digital editing or retention of authentic texture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the headdress in Image B independently, the beads seem to be securely attached and well-scaled in relation to each other and the headdress structure. They follow a natural arrangement pattern that suggests skillful assembly on an actual headdress, without appearing as though they are digitally superimposed out of place.",

      "question": "Are the baskets and produce in the foreground arranged naturally, with no visible geometric distortions or unnatural overlaps between objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground shows baskets filled with produce. They are arranged in a way that reflects a natural market setting. The absence of geometric distortions or unnatural overlapping indicates an understanding of physical space and object interactions, thus maintaining the market scene's authenticity.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The symbols on the market goods in Image B seem to be integrated with the surfaces securely and smoothly, indicative of these being naturally part of the material without obvious seams or discontinuities that might arise from digital mishandling.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands of the figure in Image B are naturally aligned, with five fingers visible on each hand. The bracelets and rings present are positioned in a way that does not distort the hand shape, suggesting careful attention to detail in maintaining anatomical consistency and aesthetic balance.",
