    "Question": "Q1: Does the plastic figurine maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the character's body, avoiding distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the proportion of the plastic figurine is noticeably different from a real human body, likely due to it being a stylized representation of a character. While the body seems distorted compared to a natural human, the exaggerated proportions are typical of figurines that emphasize certain character features like muscularity. The figurine does not have any evident broken geometric shapes or unnatural distortions typical of poorly designed objects.",
