    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style figure appear to seamlessly emerge from the kayak without any visible breaks or unnatural intersections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the photograph being held shows the kayak and skateboard in a water setting, but there is no 3D chibi-style figure visible within the kayak. Therefore, the question about the emergence of a chibi-style figure is not applicable to this image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or artifacts present around the edges where the chibi figure meets the kayak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Since there is no chibi figure present in the kayak in Image B, there are no edges where it would meet the kayak. Consequently, the question of unnatural textures or artifacts at such junctions is irrelevant.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the chibi figure relative to the kayak appear realistic and maintain structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As Image B does not contain a chibi figure within or around the kayak, there's no basis for evaluating the proportions of such a figure. This makes the question about the realistic proportions and structural consistency of a non-existent figure moot.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the Polaroid photograph holding the scene appear naturally integrated into the overall composition without any distortion or unnatural placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the Polaroid photograph is being held over a plain background and shows an image of the kayak and skateboard on water. The photograph looks properly aligned and the hands seem to naturally interact with it suggesting a thoughtful composition. There are no visible distortions or unnatural placements in the integration of the Polaroid into the hands holding it.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the materials and textures of the kayak and skateboard remained consistent and undistorted after the addition of the chibi figure and Polaroid frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kayak and skateboard's materials and textures remain consistent and akin to their appearance in Image A. The addition of the Polaroid frame does not disrupt these elements, maintaining their realistic textures and appearance across the images. There is no chibi figure present that could potentially distort these elements.",
