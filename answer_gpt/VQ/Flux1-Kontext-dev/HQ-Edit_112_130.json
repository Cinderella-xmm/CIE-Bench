      "question": "Does the brocade gown have natural-looking folds and volume in the puffy sleeves and skirt, with no stretched or flattened areas that contradict fabric behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brocade gown displays natural-looking folds, indicative of high-quality fabric design. The sleeves and skirt have a voluminous appearance, consistent with how a flowing brocade gown would drape. There are no visible areas where the fabric appears unusually stretched or flattened, indicating an understanding of fabric behavior in the depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the rose blossoms evenly distributed along the branches with natural petal shapes and color variation, and do they align with the direction of light without appearing pasted or duplicated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rose blossoms are distributed evenly along their branches, displaying a variety of petal shapes and color variations that reflect a natural alignment with the existing light direction. The lighting and shadow play on the petals suggest they are integrated into the scene rather than appearing duplicated or pasted, indicating adherence to natural lighting conditions and distribution patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues have consistent line work, proper shadowing, and spatial alignment with the ground plane and surrounding trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues exhibit consistent line work and proper shadowing. The shadow casting and perspective align appropriately with the ground plane and surrounding elements, like trees, indicating a coherent spatial arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the left hand have five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and does the right hand grip the bow in a physically plausible manner without extra digits or distorted joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left hand is shown with five fingers, displaying natural spacing and curvature. The right hand grips the bow in a manner consistent with realistic hand positioning. There are no additional digits or distortions in the joint depiction, supporting the physical plausibility of the portrayal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brocade patterns on the gown, the metal mesh of the gazebo, and the stone texture of the statues free from repeating tiles, pixelation, or unnatural smoothness that suggests low-resolution generation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features brocade patterns on the gown, metalwork on the gazebo, and stone textures on the statues that appear natural and high-resolution. These elements lack repeated tiles, pixelation, or unnatural smoothness, suggesting that they were carefully designed and rendered to avoid any artifacts that could indicate low-resolution generation.",
