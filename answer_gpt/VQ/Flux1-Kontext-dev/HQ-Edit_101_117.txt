    "Question": "Q1: Does the surface of the mannequin's body exhibit a consistent weathered stone texture throughout, without patches of remaining metallic sheen or abrupt material changes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mannequin’s surface displays a uniform texture resembling weathered stone, with no visible areas showing a metallic sheen or inconsistencies in the material. The surface of the mannequin provides visual cues such as its rough feel and muted color, indicative of a consistent stone-like texture. This observation suggests that the intention was to simulate a statue-like appearance without abrupt material changes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the floral and paisley patterns on the saree clearly visible as raised carvings on the stone surface, maintaining their original shape, symmetry, and spatial arrangement without blurring or geometric deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the saree patterns are visible as tangible relief forms carved into the stone surface. The floral and paisley motifs are distinguishable and appear to retain their original symmetry and arrangement without noticeable blurring or geometric deformation. The visual cues, such as defined lines and shapes in the carvings, support the conclusion that the patterns are preserved and correctly rendered.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the mannequin’s pose proportionally correct and structurally stable, with limbs positioned in a way that aligns with classical Indian sculpture conventions (e.g., slight tilt of head, bent elbow, relaxed hand placement) without unnatural bending or floating limbs?",
    "explanation": "The pose of the mannequin in Image B remains structurally stable and proportional, with a bent elbow and relaxed hand placement typical of classical Indian sculpture. The absence of any unnatural limb bending or floating supports the mannequin’s alignment with traditional sculptural conventions, which require stability and proportionality. These observations lead to a conclusion of correct pose alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the necklace and bangle rendered as three-dimensional stone carvings with defined edges and depth, matching their original positions and proportions, and free from ghosting or misplaced elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the necklace and bangle appear as three-dimensional carvings, showing clear definition, depth, and aligned with their original positions. Visual inspection confirms that edges are clearly defined and elements are placed accurately, without evidence of ghosting or misplacement. This adherence to detailing suggests a consistent and careful rendering of these accessories.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the folds of the saree and contours of the body show subtle signs of weathering such as surface pitting, uneven texture, and shadowed crevices, without distorting the overall shape or creating artificial highlights?",
    "explanation": "The folds of the saree and the body's contours in Image B show subtle signs of weathering, including indicators like surface pitting, uneven textures, and naturally shadowed crevices. These weathering effects integrate seamlessly with the overall shape, avoiding any artificial highlights or distortions. The visual clues confirm an authentic simulation of long-lasting stone artefactual integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
