      "question": "Do the petal-like wing structures appear translucent with smooth gradients and no jagged edges or unnatural pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wing structures are observed to be petal-like and demonstrate translucency. The gradients are seamless, transitioning smoothly from one color to another, and there are no visible jagged edges or pixelation that would suggest a lack of quality. Smooth color transitions are evident in the wing shading, which enhances the natural softness and translucency of the wings.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the golden tendrils smoothly attached to the head, with consistent metallic sheen and visible sparkle effects that do not distort the surrounding area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows golden tendrils attached to the individual's head, which appear smooth and consistent with a metallic sheen. The sparkle effects are discernible and add to the visual detail without distorting adjacent areas, maintaining the integrity of the image. The tendrils are integrated into the design without causing interruptions in lighting or texture.",

      "question": "Does the floral texture on the butterfly’s body follow the natural contours without warping or breaking the underlying shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the butterfly's body displays a floral texture that aligns with the natural contours of its shape. There is no apparent warping or distortion, ensuring the design maintains the structural integrity of a butterfly. The patterns flow with the contours, enhancing the realism and aesthetic of the butterfly without breaking the underlying form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sapphire orb eyes symmetrically positioned and emitting a soft glow without bleeding into the head or causing halo artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sapphire orb eyes are positioned symmetrically on the head. The glow emitted is soft and does not bleed into the head, which helps avoid any halo artifacts or distortions. This maintains clean aesthetic lines and enhances the visual appeal without compromising on clarity or quality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the starry trail aligned with the butterfly’s position and orientation, with gradual fading and no abrupt edges or floating particles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the starry trail is aligned with the butterfly, complementing its position and orientation. The fading is gradual, starting from a point near the butterfly and dissipating smoothly, showing no abrupt edges or discrepancies with floating particles which might otherwise detract from the nuanced look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the floating blooms positioned at plausible distances from the ground and integrated with the lighting gradient without casting inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B reveals floating blooms positioned at reasonable distances from the ground, integrating well with the lighting gradient and ambient colors. The shadows, or lack thereof, do not create inconsistency, suggesting the lighting computations were handled cohesively to maintain the realistic feel of the scene.",
