      "question": "Are the edges of the man’s head, cap, and shoulders sharp and unaltered by the added shadowy textures or angular lines, with no visible distortion or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the man's head, cap, and shoulders are blended into a textured background that includes angular lines and shadowy elements typical of book cover design. This suggests these added textures might alter or affect the original sharpness of the edges. Recognizing that book covers often use such techniques for artistic effect, these alterations appear intentional.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the title \"The Gray Mystery\" positioned outside the man’s face and cap area, and does it not partially cover or obscure any facial features or clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'The Gray Mystery' is positioned at the bottom of the image and does not encroach upon the area of the man’s blurred face and cap. This is a common design choice to ensure that text remains readable and does not overlap any significant imagery or features, particularly in promotional materials or book covers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the silhouettes of the cityscape and magnifying glass appear integrated into the background without intersecting or distorting the man’s head or shoulders, and do they maintain consistent depth relative to the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouettes of the cityscape and magnifying glass are positioned behind the man's image, serving as a backdrop. This maintains a coherent visual depth where these elements are clearly distinct and do not intersect with or distort the man's head or shoulders, which is typical in graphic design to create a layered depth effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the skin tones, facial hair, and fabric textures of the cap and shirt still visible and consistent with their original appearance, without unnatural yellowing or fading due to the sepia effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sepia effect gives the image a warm, vintage appearance, affecting color tones across the image. This effect naturally impacts all colors, including skin tones and fabric textures, resulting in a yellowish hue that can cause deviation from the original colors in Image A. Such effects are purposefully used to evoke a classic or nostalgic aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the gray cap and shirt display consistent fabric texture and weave pattern, with no visible artifacts such as blurring, noise, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the sepia tone alters the color scheme, the texture and weave pattern of the cap and shirt remain recognizable despite some loss of detail. There is no significant blurring, noise, or unnatural highlights that disrupts the perception of fabric, suggesting that these elements are preserved intentionally.",
