    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the surface of the painted figure show consistent brushstroke patterns and subtle texture variations typical of oil paint on wood, without blocky or repetitive digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By evaluating the surface visually, the painting in Image B emulates a traditional oil painting style with visible brushstrokes and texture variations that are consistent with a hand-painted technique. There are no visible digital artifacts such as blockiness or repetitiveness, which indicates that the textures have been carefully integrated and maintain an organic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the strands of the elongated beard and mustache maintain continuous, fiber-like structure without forming unnatural loops, droplets, or fluid-like surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beard and mustache strands in Image B appear to flow naturally with a fiber-like structure. They maintain continuity and do not exhibit any unnatural loops or fluid-like surfaces. This suggests careful attention to texture and detail, ensuring the features remain lifelike and realistic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the velvet texture of the cloak smooth and reflective with depth, and are the golden embroidery lines evenly spaced and aligned with the fabric folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cloak's texture resembles velvet with some smoothness and slight reflective quality. The embroidery appears evenly spaced, and the alignment with the fabric folds is consistent, giving a sense of depth and richness in detail, characteristic of opulent fabrics.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wide-brimmed hat positioned correctly on the head without distorting the skull shape, and are the peacock feathers attached along the brim with natural curvature and no clipping into the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wide-brimmed hat in Image B sits naturally on the head without distorting the underlying skull shape. The peacock feathers attached to the brim display a natural curvature and do not appear to clip into the face or present any inconsistencies with their attachment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the brooch cast a soft shadow onto the cloak and reflect light consistently with its surroundings, indicating proper placement and integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brooch in Image B casts a soft shadow on the cloak, consistent with the surrounding light sources, indicating a sense of realism in its integration. The reflection of light enhances the perception of metallic properties, suggesting proper attention to placement and environmental interaction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the edges of the figure cleanly separated from the background without haloing, double outlines, or partial transparency that suggests poor compositing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of the figure in Image B are sharply defined, showing a clean separation from the background. There are no artifacts such as haloing, double outlines, or any partial transparency that would typically indicate poor compositing techniques.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred face, the assessment cannot be made. Thus, based on provided instructions, this point is excluded from the answer as it pertains directly to blurred features.",
