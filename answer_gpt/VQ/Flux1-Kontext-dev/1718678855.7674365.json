      "question": "Does the top hat sit naturally on the capybara's head without distorting the head shape or causing visible seams or texture mismatches?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top hat is a common accessory in formal attire and should ideally sit securely on the head without causing any visual disruptions in the form of distortions or mismatches. In the edited image, the top hat appears to sit naturally on the capybara’s head, as it maintains the head shape without visible seams or texture mismatches.",

      "question": "Is the teacup held by the capybara’s front paws at a natural angle and scale, with no deformation or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the image, the teacup is an object typically held in a way that is secure and aligned with the hand or paw. The edited image shows the capybara’s front paw holding the teacup at an angle that seems natural and plausible with appropriate scale, without any signs of deformation or floating appearance, maintaining a realistic portrayal.",

      "question": "Does the suit worn by the capybara exhibit consistent fabric texture, natural draping, and appropriate seam lines that follow the animal’s body contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A suit typically should have consistent fabric texture and seam lines that accommodate the contours of the body it is tailored for. In the edited image, the suit on the capybara shows uniform fabric texture and appropriate draping, making it look well-fitted without discrepancies in the alignment of seam lines.",

      "question": "Is the monocle positioned properly over the capybara’s eye without overlapping fur unnaturally or showing rendering artifacts like ghosting or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The monocle should be placed precisely over the eye, without interfering with other elements like fur or causing artifacts that affect visual coherence. The edited image depicts the monocle well-positioned without any unnatural overlap with the fur or artifacts, ensuring a seamless integration into the facial features.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the London riverscape background align with the lighting and time of day of the original scene, and do architectural elements like Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament appear proportionally correct and spatially coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Architectural elements in the background must align with the expected proportionality and spatial coherence based on lighting conditions and time of day to maintain visual harmony. In the edited image, Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament appear correctly proportioned and coherent within the scene, with lighting that matches the depicted time of day in a realistic manner.",
