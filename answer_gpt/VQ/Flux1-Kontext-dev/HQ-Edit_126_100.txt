    "Question": "Q1: Do the transformed columns resemble organic wooden legs with natural joint angles and proportional thickness, without visible distortion or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the columns have been edited to look like organic wooden legs. They feature natural joint angles and proportional thickness that are typical for tree limbs or roots. The appearance suggests a seamless integration with the overall structure, avoiding distortion or broken geometry, keeping them visually harmonious and realistic.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the roof area show a gradual transition from straw-like material to leafy branches with realistic leaf shapes, spacing, and lighting interaction, without jagged edges or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "The roof in Image B transitions from straw to a green, leafy texture. The leaves maintain realistic shapes and spacing, with appropriate lighting that interacts with the structure naturally. There are no jagged edges or unnatural textures, suggesting a well-executed transformation with attention to realistic detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the satellite dish replaced by a large, detailed eye with a visible iris and pupil, positioned naturally on the side of the structure, without floating elements or mismatched shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the satellite dish is still present on the side of the house, not replaced by an eye. Therefore, the structure does not depict a large, detailed eye; this element reflects incorrect transformation as per the question.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the wall surfaces covered with detailed bark patterns showing natural cracks, ridges, and color gradients, without repeating textures or uniformity indicating artificial generation?",
    "explanation": "The wall surfaces in Image B display detailed bark patterns with natural cracks and ridges. The color gradients seem natural and varied, avoiding obvious repetition or uniformity seen in artificial generation. This textured appearance contributes significantly to the overall organic and natural impression.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the orange blossoms emit a faint, diffused glow that blends with ambient lighting, without sharp halos or unnatural brightness that separates them from the surrounding environment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the orange blossoms do not emit a distinct glow that merges seamlessly with the ambient lighting. They appear as bright floral accents, but the description of a faint, diffused glow blending with ambient light is not evident. The blossoms are integrated visually without creating unnatural halos or brightness.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the vines emerge from multiple points on the structure, hang downward with natural curvature and density variation, and interact realistically with light and shadows?",
    "explanation": "The vines in Image B originate from various points on the structure, hanging in a manner that showcases natural curvature and varied density. They interact realistically with the light and shadows, enhancing the organic and natural look of the house.",
    "answer": "Yes"
