    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head proportionally enlarged but still geometrically consistent with the neck and shoulders, without unnatural stretching or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the figure is proportionally larger compared to typical human proportions, aligning with the chibi style design where characters often have oversized heads. Despite the enlargement, the head remains geometrically consistent with the neck and shoulder structure, maintaining overall symmetry and proportionality without signs of unnatural stretching or compression. This is a characteristic trait of stylized figures where exaggerated features do not compromise structural integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the body, dress, and hair uniformly rendered with a soft rubber texture, free from conflicting textures or glossy reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a visual render that emphasizes a soft rubber texture for the figure's body, dress, and hair. This creates a uniform appearance throughout, which is fitting for a keychain design where materials used tend to have matte finishes without glossy reflections, ensuring consistency in texture.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red boots and lace dress clearly identifiable with preserved structural details such as buckles, stitching, and knit patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red boots are depicted with identifiable details like the buckle, which aligns with common design elements in footwear. While the knit pattern of the dress does not show intricate structural details due to the stylized rendering, the overall design remains identifiable as a lace dress. The simplification is typical in the creation of stylized accessories like keychains, where detailed textures are minimized.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bent posture maintain anatomical alignment of the spine, hips, and knees without unnatural angles or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the anatomical alignment of the figure's posture. The bent position shows a coherent alignment of spine, hips, and knees, which is typical in illustrations where despite stylization, the body does not exhibit unnatural angles or segments that break the continuity of a human posture.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the silver keyring visibly connected to the character without gaps or overlapping edges, and does the wooden plank background show consistent texture and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silver keyring is securely attached to the character, showing no gaps or overlapping edges that could disrupt the visual attachment. The background displays a wooden plank with consistent texture and spacing, which matches the typical surface aesthetics expected from such materials. The consistent patterning aids in maintaining visual clarity.",
