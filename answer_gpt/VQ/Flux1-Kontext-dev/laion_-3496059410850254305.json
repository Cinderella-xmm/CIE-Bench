      "question": "Does the outline of the guitar body remain intact and undistorted after being converted into an armored torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outline of the guitar body is clearly visible as an essential part of the superhero's armor. The integration with the superhero design has preserved the original shape and structure of the guitar body without showing distortions. This indicates that the guitar's outline remained intact.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the metallic finish applied to the guitar body consistent with the original wood grain pattern, showing no signs of artificial texture tiling or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the wood grain pattern on the guitar body, mimicking the essence of the original texture seen in Image A. The superhero design does not introduce artificial texture tiling or reflections inconsistent with the original pattern, suggesting a natural integration.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the illustrative lines evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the guitar's curvature without overlapping or cutting through structural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrative lines enhance the dynamic superhero pose and are aligned to match the curvature of the guitar part used as armor without interfering with its structural components, achieving an effect of motion and energy.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the strings appear as continuous, taut muscle strands that follow the bodyâ€™s contour without kinks, gaps, or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon viewing Image B, the strings of the guitar serve a purpose aligned with muscle strands in the superhero design but maintain their original tautness and continuity without showing kinks or gaps, resulting in a visually cohesive appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cape extend naturally from the neck, showing smooth folds and consistent sound wave patterns along its length without abrupt changes or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cape in Image B appears to extend from the neck with dynamic movement, depicted in smooth folds in line with the superhero aesthetic. However, the sound wave patterns suggest action and might not follow a consistent pattern due to artistic interpretation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar's headstock retains visibility of the emblem and brand name without alignment issues or overlap with tuning pegs, maintaining the original design integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as pixelation, color bleeding, or sharp discontinuities at the junctions between original guitar parts and added elements?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
