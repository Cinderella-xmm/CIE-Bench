      "question": "Do the facial features and accessories of the individuals appear detailed and clear despite the enlarged heads?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are blurred intentionally, which means they lack detail and clarity of specific features such as eyes, nose, and mouth. The heads appear proportionally accurate with the accessories like hats and hoods visible without distortion. Therefore, despite the enlarged heads, due to intentional blurring, the facial features are not detailed and clear.",
