        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lettuce shapes maintain their connection to the sandwich, and while the thick-painted cartoon style alters their texture slightly, it does not introduce any unnatural disruptions. The shapes look stylized but still logically connected to the sandwich.",
