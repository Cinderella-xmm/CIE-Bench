    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the facial area exhibit a consistent dark wood texture with natural grain patterns, maintaining accurate facial proportions and avoiding distortions such as warped features or inconsistent surface depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image B, the facial area is obscured, and we cannot observe any wood texture or features. Therefore, we cannot evaluate the consistency of texture or proportions.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the clothing rendered as deeply incised carvings with visible relief depth, and do they preserve the original arrangement of colors and shapes without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the patterns on the clothing appear to be deeply incised carvings which create visible relief depth. The colors are consistent and appear to preserve the original vibrant arrangement observed in the context, avoiding any blurring or misalignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the beads on the crown and earrings clearly defined with vibrant, non-blended colors, appearing as painted details on the wooden surface rather than merged or distorted textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beads on the crown and earrings in image B are rendered with distinct, vibrant colors, maintaining their clarity. They appear as well-painted details with no evidence of merged or distorted textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of low-relief carved plant forms that maintain spatial depth and botanical structure, without flattening or losing the sense of layered vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of image B shows a carved wooden texture with detailed plant forms that maintain a sense of spatial depth and botanical structure. It avoids flattening and retains the layered vegetation appearance through its relief design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire sculpture surface display a consistent polished finish with no visible rendering artifacts, such as edge halos, texture repetition, or missing fine details in the hair, beads, or clothing carvings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of image B overall presents a polished finish without visible rendering artifacts. There are no apparent edge halos, texture repetition, or missing fine details in the hair, beads, and clothing carvings.",
