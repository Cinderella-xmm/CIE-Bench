    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass dome cover the entire scene without distorting the underlying elements such as the house, tree, or ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome encases the entire miniature scene, allowing visibility of all elements (house, trees, ground) without any distortion. This is feasible due to the clarity and smoothness of the glass, typical in display domes used for collection pieces where the visual integrity of the scene is maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the mossy green pathways aligned with the terrain level and blended naturally with the surrounding ground texture?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows pathways covered in green moss that conform smoothly to the terrain level and integrate seamlessly with the surrounding texture. This is evident as the moss follows the contour of the steps and spreads naturally without abrupt edges, typical of how such moss would behave in a realistic landscape setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the newly added shrubs have a size and texture consistent with the existing plants in the scene?",
    "explanation": "The newly introduced shrubs in Image B maintain consistency with other plant elements (like the tree) in terms of scale and texture. The shrub textures resemble natural greenery seen in such miniature scenes, adhering to a cohesive horticultural design where variations are minimal to maintain aesthetic alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the lake positioned on the ground with defined edges and a reflective surface that interacts realistically with surrounding elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lake is depicted with clear, defined edges and a reflective surface that realistically mirrors the light from the dome and nearby objects like the bridge. The placement and water-like sheen align with typical portrayals of miniature water bodies designed to enhance realistic scene elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the fairy lights wrapped around the tree branches in a way that follows their shape and emits a soft, uniform glow without harsh highlights?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows fairy lights elegantly adorning the tree branches, emitting a gentle glow typical of subtle ambient lighting rather than harsh, bright points. This is consistent with the goal of accenting the tree form without overwhelming the scene, following common practices in decorative miniature scenes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the bridge span the lake with stable supports and connect directly to the ground on both sides without floating or tilting?",
    "explanation": "The bridge seen in Image B is securely positioned across the lake, with clear connections to the ground on both sides. This forms a stable crossing without exhibiting any distortion or uneven alignment, exemplifying solid structural integration typical in scenes involving bodies of water and bridging structures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are all added elements (dome, lake, bridge, lights) rendered with materials and lighting that match the rustic, natural aesthetic of the original scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each enhancement—dome, lake, bridge, and lights—harmonize with the overall rustic and nature-inspired motif of the scene through appropriate material and lighting usage. These items incorporate textures and finishes that blend with the terracotta tones of the house and earthen ground, maintaining aesthetic continuity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
