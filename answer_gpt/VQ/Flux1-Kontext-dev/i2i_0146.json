      "question": "Are the stripes on the zebra consistent with its natural patterns without appearing as unnatural or disjointed lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes appear to be natural and smoothly follow the contours of the zebra's body, which is consistent with the patterns seen on real zebras. The stripes are uniform in size and don't exhibit any signs of disjointed or broken lines that would indicate editing artifacts. Hence, the stripes maintain their natural appearance.",

      "question": "Do the zebra's ears maintain their natural upright position without any distortion or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's ears are upright and proportionate, a characteristic seen in real zebras. The ears display no signs of unnatural bending or distortion, maintaining a natural shape and orientation, which is typical of how zebra ears are positioned.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the zebra maintain realistic proportions in its limbs and body, avoiding any grossly exaggerated or distorted features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's body and limbs appear to be realistically proportioned. The neck, torso, legs, and other parts of the zebra show no signs of exaggeration or unnatural distortion, maintaining typical dimensions seen in real-life zebras.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B closely, the texture of the zebra's coat is smooth and consistent, free from any unnatural artifacts or pixelation that might indicate poor editing or image quality issues. The stripes and coat color transitions look natural without abrupt changes or pixelation artifacts.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grass in Image B appears natural, with no visible signs of alterations or artifacts. It maintains the appearance of typical grass found in nature, and no parts of the grass show any digital tampering or fragmentation that would suggest it has been edited.",
