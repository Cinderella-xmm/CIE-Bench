      "question": "Does the white border framing the image maintain a clean edge along the entire perimeter without disrupting the natural appearance of the dessert inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white border around Image B seems consistent and well-defined, creating a Polaroid-style effect. It doesn't interfere with the visibility or appearance of the dessert, which retains focus within the center of the frame.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the light brown vintage filter applied to the image enhance its film-style appearance without causing any parts of the banana slices or whipped cream to appear unnaturally colored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vintage filter casts a warmer tone over the entire image, contributing to a film-like aesthetic. While the color change is noticeable, the banana slices and whipped cream retain a natural, recognizable color, suggesting the filter is applied in a manner that maintains realistic coloration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the handwritten caption \"Banana Cream Dream 2024\" at the bottom clear and legible with a natural look that complements the Polaroid-style photo without seeming out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The caption 'Banana Cream Dream 2024' in Image B is presented in a handwritten style, consistent with the Polaroid's retro aesthetic. Handwritten captions often enhance such styles by providing a personal touch. The placement and legibility suggest it fits naturally within the image's theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details like the texture of the whipped cream and the smooth surface of the cheesecake slice been preserved without showing any unnatural artifacts or blurring due to the editing effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the applied vintage filter, the fine details in Image B, such as the texture of the whipped cream and smoothness of the cheesecake, remain visible and well-defined. This implies the filter was applied judiciously, without compromising detail quality through excessive blurring or artifact introduction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the newly added Polaroid frame and caption seamlessly integrate with the original image of the cheesecake and bananas, ensuring the dessert remains the focal point and no elements look disjointed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The integration of the Polaroid frame and caption in Image B appears harmonious, with the dessert centrally placed and remaining the main visual element. The frame and caption add a cohesive aesthetic layer, enhancing rather than detracting from the image's original focus.",
