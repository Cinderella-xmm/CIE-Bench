      "question": "Does the schematic outline of the wallet maintain accurate proportions and closed geometric shapes without jagged edges or missing lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrated schematic of the wallet maintains a clean and coherent shape, indicative of accurate proportions and closed geometric representation. There are no visible jagged edges or breaks in the lines that would suggest missing connections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lines forming the wallet’s schematic structure uniformly thin, continuous, and free of smudges or inconsistent thickness that suggest texture or artifact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lines outlining the wallet in Image B are uniform and continuous. There are no smudges or variations in thickness that would indicate texture inconsistencies or artifacts, contributing to the clarity and readability of the schematic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the text annotations for “USD,” “QAR,” and “INR” placed adjacent to their respective banknote slots without overlapping the notes or distorting the wallet’s layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the annotations 'USD,' 'QAR,' and 'INR' are placed appropriately above or near the slots of the respective banknotes without overlapping the notes or causing any distortion to the layout of the wallet.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the exchange rate charts and country economy icons aligned horizontally or vertically in a balanced manner, with no floating or misplaced elements that disrupt visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom section of Image B contains a chart and other annotations. While the annotations are correctly placed, the economy icons are not clearly shown or identified as balanced elements in Image B. Therefore, some of the alignment or clarity may be questioned.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the visible banknotes (USD $20, QAR 10, INR 50) retain clear denominations, readable text, and intact designs without blurring, stretching, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banknotes designed for 'USD,' 'QAR,' and 'INR' are depicted as schematic diagrams, which do not feature the actual text or designs of the notes. They lack the detail necessary for clear denomination or readability, instead appearing as generalized representations.",
