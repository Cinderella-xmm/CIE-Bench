      "question": "Does the chibi version of the woman have a proportionally enlarged head relative to the body, with limbs and torso scaled down appropriately without deformed joints or elongated limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall style resembles a chibi or caricature form, which typically features a larger head relative to the body. While the limbs and torso appear scaled down compared to the head, they maintain proportions that are typical of the chibi style without showing signs of deformation such as elongated limbs or deformed joints.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the oversized frills on the gown rendered with curved, layered shapes that suggest fabric volume, and do they avoid flat, rigid edges or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gown's frills are depicted with a design that suggests volume through the use of curved, layered shapes. These elements are typical in illustrating fabric and contribute to the three-dimensional appearance. The frills do not exhibit flat or rigid edges and do not show any signs of being unnaturally stretched, which is important in creating a realistic depiction of fabric.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the jewelry show consistent metallic highlights and soft shadows that align with the lighting direction in the scene, without harsh glints or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) demonstrates gold jewelry with highlights and shadows that are consistent with a light source coming from a specific direction. The highlights are subtle and align with the overall aesthetic, free of harsh glints that might distract from the scene. There are no visible texture artifacts that would detract from the perceived quality.",

      "question": "Is the modified chair still identifiable as a chair with four legs and backrest, scaled down proportionally and colored vividly without broken geometry or missing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair remains identifiable as a piece of furniture, displaying a backrest and assumed legs that although not fully visible, are implied by the structure. The chair has been scaled to fit the composition and colored to maintain the vibrant palette of the image. There are no indications of broken geometry or missing parts that hinder its identification as a chair.",

      "question": "Does the pearl border surround the image edge evenly, with uniformly sized spheres and consistent spacing, without overlapping the subject or showing jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pearl border in Image B is crafted to evenly surround the edges, consisting of uniformly sized spheres that maintain consistent spacing. This border does not interfere with the main subject of the image and is free from jagged edges, which would otherwise disrupt the fluidity of the design.",
