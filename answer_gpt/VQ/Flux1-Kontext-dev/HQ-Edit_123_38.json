      "question": "Does the brushstroke effect cover the figure evenly without disrupting the outline of limbs, head, or torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brushstroke effect adds a stylized layer to the image. The outline of the limbs, head, and torso remains clear, with no noticeable disruptions or distortions to the shape, suggesting that the brushstroke effect is applied evenly. This is evident in the continuous curves and lines that are consistent with their natural form.",

      "question": "Are the enlarged hands anatomically accurate with five fingers each, and do they maintain natural joint alignment and skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's hands appear anatomically sound with five fingers each. They maintain a natural alignment of joints, and the stylized texture does not obscure the fundamental characteristics, indicating accurate representation despite artistic stylization.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the elongated legs form a continuous, curved line from the hips to the feet without abrupt bends or discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs are depicted in a dynamic pose. They maintain a curved, continuous line from the hips to the feet, which is consistent with the intended athletic posture. No abrupt bends or discontinuities are present, indicating an accurate representation.",

      "question": "Are the blue and silver gradients smoothly blended across the leotard and skin, without visible banding or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue and silver gradients across the leotard and areas of skin in Image B are smoothly blended, with no visible banding or harsh transitions. The gradients appear even and are designed to follow the contours of the body realistically, providing a natural look.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the swirling ribbons and stars placed around the figure in a manner that follows the direction of movement and does not intersect with the body or balance beam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swirling ribbons and stars are positioned to enhance the depiction of motion. They are thoughtfully arranged around the figure, following the implied direction of movement. None of the elements intersect with the body or the balance beam, maintaining clarity.",
