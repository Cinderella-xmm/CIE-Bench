      "question": "Are the chibi-style 3D models of the sheep and clock free from unnatural textures and maintain their fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep and the clock are encapsulated within a clear snow globe. The sheep and the clock appear to maintain a high level of detail with smooth, consistent textures. The sheep's wool looks textured and realistic for a stylized model, and the clock face is clear and readable. Chibi-style models are typically characterized by exaggerated but smooth and consistent details, which are present here. From the visual cues, there's no evidence of blurring or unnatural textures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the sheep appear naturally leaning against the clock without any distortion or unnatural positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep stands close to the clock, encapsulated in a snow globe. The sheep appears upright, standing on a surface inside the snow globe, with no indication of leaning or physical contact suggesting distortion. It retains a natural upright posture, which is typical for a sheep positioned next to an object, enhancing the realism in a stylized context.",

      "question": "Do the gently drifting snowflakes inside the snow globe add to the scene naturally without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B contains drifting snowflakes that scatter around the sheep and clock. These snowflakes appear as light particles without any abrupt edges or digital artifacts, contributing to an atmospheric effect typical of a snow globe without disrupting the visual integrity of the main elements inside.",

      "question": "Does the wooden tabletop and warm, neutral-toned background create a visually harmonious and cozy atmosphere without any inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setting in Image B includes a warm-toned wooden tabletop and a softly lit, neutral background. These elements blend smoothly with the warm light reflections on the snow globe, creating a cozy, harmonious scene. There are no stark contrasts or mismatched color hues, reflecting a consistent atmosphere suited to the overall theme of warmth and nostalgia.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the snow globe, sheep, clock, and tabletop consistent and logical?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe contains the sheep and clock assembled in a balanced manner. The sheep and clock proportions look suitable for a real-world snow globe scenario, and the base of the globe is correctly positioned on the tabletop. The objects inside the globe are in scale relative to each other, avoiding any unrealistic size discrepancies, thus maintaining logical physical relationships.",
