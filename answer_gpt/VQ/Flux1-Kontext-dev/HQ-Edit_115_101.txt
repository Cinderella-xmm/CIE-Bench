    "Question": "Q1: Does the cylindrical glass body maintain consistent curvature and transparency, with the embossed patterns clearly visible and proportionally scaled across the surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass bottle is cylindrical with a smooth surface that maintains consistent curvature. The transparency allows the viewer to see the contents inside, and the embossed patterns on the bottle are clearly visible, appearing proportionally scaled. This can be determined by observing the even surface and uniform design across the bottle.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the label 'Timeless Reserve' centered within the circular area, with Roman numerals uniformly positioned along its perimeter and matching the font style and size of the original clock face?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the label 'Timeless Reserve' centered within a circular area on the bottle, and the Roman numerals are uniformly positioned around the perimeter. While these numerals maintain the aesthetic of Roman numerals similar to Image A, direct font style and size comparison shows some variance, suggesting they do not match exactly in style or size.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the top ring now resemble a functional bottle cap with a cork stopper that has a natural porous texture, and are the gold accents seamlessly integrated without visible seams or inconsistent lighting?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the bottle cap which resembles a functional cap with a cork stopper, evident from the texture and appearance of the material. The gold accents are also integrated well into the design with consistent lighting, showing no visible seams.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ornamental scrollwork patterns preserved with full depth and clarity across the curved glass surface, showing no signs of stretching, compression, or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental scrollwork patterns on the bottle are preserved well, maintaining depth and clarity. Observing the bottle, these patterns do not show signs of stretching, compression, or pixelation as they fit the curvature naturally.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the reflections and shadows on the glass bottle align with the lighting direction of the scene, and are there no visible seams, ghosting, or texture discontinuities at the boundaries between the bottle and the wood?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in Image B casts appropriate reflections and shadows on the glass bottle, which appear aligned with the scene's lighting direction. The transition between the bottle and the wooden background is seamless, with no visible seams, ghosting, or texture discontinuities observed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
