      "question": "Does the roof of the van in Panel 1 tilt upward at a plausible angle without distorting the side panels or creating visible seams or breaks in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of the edited image (Image B), the roof of the van appears to maintain a realistic and consistent shape relative to the rest of the vehicle. There do not appear to be visible seams or distortions along the side panels, indicating that any modification to the roof does not compromise the structural integrity of the depicted van. This suggests that the roof does tilt upward at a plausible angle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cactus in Panel 2 transformed into a spout with continuous curves and matching texture, and does it cast a shadow consistent with the light source direction seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 depicts a cactus transformed into a spout, which maintains continuous curves that resemble the cacti's organic forms and textures. Additionally, the shadow cast by this cactus-spout structure aligns well with the direction of the light source, which is consistent with the shadow directions observed in the original Image A. This suggests a seamless transformation in line with the lighting depicted.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the newly added plants around the oasis in Panel 3 rendered with the same level of detail and color harmony as the original cacti, and do they cast shadows that align with the scene’s lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 3, the added plants near the oasis display a level of detail and color harmony that blends well with the existing cacti and environment. The colors are consistent with the desert setting, and the shadows cast by these new plants follow the established direction of light seen throughout the graphic, maintaining visual coherence.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the text bubbles in all three panels positioned so they do not overlap critical parts of the van or landscape, and do they use a font style and size that matches the handwritten \"Road Trip\" title?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In each panel of Image B, the text bubbles are placed so that they avoid overlapping important parts of the scene, such as the van or significant features of the landscape. However, the font style and size of the text inside these bubbles do not match the elegant, handwritten style of the 'Road Trip' title seen in the original image. The text in the bubbles appears more standard in comic style and does not have the handwritten appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the water splashes in Panel 3 show droplets with varied sizes and arcing paths, and do they appear to originate from the van’s side without floating unnaturally above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water splashes in Panel 3 of the edited image depict droplets that vary in size and follow an arcing trajectory, simulating a realistic spray. These droplets seem to originate from the expected location and do not appear to float unnaturally, which contributes to the plausible interaction with the surrounding environment shown.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the headlights in Panel 2 enlarged and brightened but still contained within the original housing, and do they retain their round shape without stretching or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2, the headlights of the van appear slightly brightened, but they remain within their original housing and maintain their round shape. There is no evidence of distortion or clipping, which means the modification enhances the lights' prominence without altering their fundamental design.",
