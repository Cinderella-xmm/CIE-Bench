      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the robot figures derived from the batteries have limbs and heads that are proportionally sized and attached in a way that maintains structural coherence with their original cylindrical form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot figures appear to have limbs and heads that are proportionally sized and structured. The design of the robots manages to keep a cylindrical vertical alignment reminiscent of the battery shape, with limbs and heads attached in a way that feels naturally cohesive. This design takes into account the cylindrical shape of the original battery, translating it into a humanoid form while still echoing the original structure. Thus, the figures are structurally coherent with their origin.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the robot figures made from the batteries rendered with a consistent metallic texture that mimics copper and black materials without visible artifacts like checkerboard patterns or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of the robot figures in Image B shows a metallic texture that suggests a copper and black color scheme, similar to the original battery design. There are no apparent artifacts such as checkerboard patterns or unnatural reflections. The surfaces appear smooth and consistent, ensuring a clean and professional look, maintaining the thematic connection to the Duracell battery's aesthetics.",

      "question": "Is the digital cityscape background positioned behind the robot figures with correct layering, atmospheric gradient, and light source alignment that matches the direction of illumination on the robots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital cityscape background is positioned to give an immersive and thematic effect. The lighting on the robots aligns well with the assumed direction of the light source from the background, and the atmospheric gradient enhances the depth of the scene. This shows a well-integrated layering where both foreground and background elements are in harmony, with ambient lighting tying the elements together smoothly.",
