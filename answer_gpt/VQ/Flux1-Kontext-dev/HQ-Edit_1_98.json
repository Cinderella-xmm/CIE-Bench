      "question": "Does the floral engraving on the dress appear seamlessly integrated into the fabric without visible texture breaks, misaligned patterns, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the floral engraving on the dress, it appears well-integrated into the fabric. The engravings follow the natural contours of the dress without visible breaks or misalignments. The texture and light on the fabric are consistent, suggesting that the engravings are naturally part of the dress without unnatural highlights disrupting the surface.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sepia tones applied uniformly across all elements (including skin, dress, violin, window frame, and plants) without localized color distortions or loss of detail in shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sepia tone gives an overall warm hue to the image. The colors appear uniformly applied to the skin, dress, violin, window frame, and plants. There is no apparent distortion in color or excessive darkening/lightening that causes a loss of detail in shadows or highlights; this consistency enhances the image's cohesiveness.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the abstract swirls in the window view remain confined within the window panes and align correctly with their borders, without overlapping into the room or distorting the window structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the abstract swirls seen through the window glass stay within the borders of the window panes. There doesn't appear to be any overlap into the interior room, and the swirls naturally align with the framework of the window without distorting its structure, maintaining architectural accuracy.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gold inlays on the violin positioned along logical contours of the instrument and do they exhibit consistent metallic sheen and reflection without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The examination of the violin in Image B reveals that the gold inlays are precisely placed along the logical curves and contours of the instrument. They exhibit a consistent metallic sheen and reflect light appropriately, which indicates that they are well-integrated into the violin's design and do not appear detached or misaligned.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the handwritten music score border evenly spaced, legible, and aligned along the image edge without intersecting or obscuring any part of the violinist, window, or foreground objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The border in Image B, reminiscent of a handwritten music score, is evenly spaced along the edges of the image. It maintains consistent alignment without intersecting or covering parts of the violinist, window, or any objects in the foreground, ensuring that it enhances rather than disrupts the image's overall composition.",
