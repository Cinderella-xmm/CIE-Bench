      "question": "Does the 3D chibi rendition of the dancer maintain natural proportions without introducing any unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's proportions appear natural and consistent with human anatomy. The limbs and torso are well-balanced, without any unnatural elongations or compressions, indicating no geometric distortions. The choice to use shadows and highlights also helps emphasize the realistic shape and proportion of the dancer.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glowing elliptical portal visually credible, with no obvious artifacts where it meets the realistic dance studio environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a glowing elliptical portal that seamlessly integrates into the scene. The lighting from the portal affects the surrounding environment consistently and without visible artifacts or inconsistencies in merging the digital effect with the realistic background. The smooth transitions and appropriate illumination make it visually credible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dancer's hand extending towards the viewer retain natural textures and details, with no more than five fingers visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's hand that extends forward appears anatomically correct with natural bending and sufficient details, including textures and shading. The hand clearly displays five fingers, which are proportionally accurate, ensuring no distortions in quantity or realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the spotlight effects in the grayscale 3D chibi world consistent with the dancer's pose, contributing to a natural and visually plausible scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grayscale 3D chibi world in Image B shows spotlight effects that enhance the perception of depth and focus on the dancer. The lighting is coherent with the dancer's pose, creating natural shadows and highlights. The light direction and intensity contribute to a visually plausible scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition adhere to the 2:3 aspect ratio, with the dancer and portal positioned in a balanced manner that enhances visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to maintain a 2:3 aspect ratio, typical for many photographic compositions. The dancer is positioned slightly off-center within the elliptical portal, providing a well-balanced composition. This placement efficiently uses the space and contributes to the overall visual appeal and symmetry of the image.",
