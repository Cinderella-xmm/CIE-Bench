      "question": "Are the iridescent wings attached to the spider’s thorax symmetrically and do they display smooth, continuous mosaic-like patterns without jagged edges or texture breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the iridescent wings are attached symmetrically to the thorax of the spider, indicating careful consideration to maintain balance and proportion in the design. The wings feature continuous mosaic-like patterns that are smooth and without jagged edges or texture breaks, as evidenced by their uniform and harmonious appearance. This implies a deliberate artistic choice to ensure the wings appear elegant and cohesive.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the luminous orb positioned where the original abdomen was, and does it maintain proportional size and alignment with the spider’s body without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminous orb is located where the original spider's abdomen would be, suggesting a direct transformation of that body part. It aligns well with the rest of the body, keeping proportional size with respect to the spider's overall anatomy, ensuring it does not look artificially appended or out of place. This adds to the fantasy-like alteration while respecting anatomical continuity.",

      "question": "Do the golden filigree spirals wrap around each leg segment smoothly, following the natural bends and joints without breaking or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden filigree spirals in Image B are aesthetically wrapped around the spider's legs, adhering closely to the natural contours, bends, and joints. This consistency and smoothness indicate a considered decoration that respects the intrinsic shape and mobility of the spider's appendages, providing a seamless enhancement to its physical form.",

      "question": "Are the fangs now thin, translucent, and needle-shaped, extending naturally from the spider’s mouth area without appearing misshapen or disconnected?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the fangs shows them as thin, translucent, and needle-shaped, appearing to extend naturally from the spider’s mouth area. This description implies a transformation that maintains anatomical correctness, ensuring they do not look out of place, misshapen, or disconnected from the mouth, thereby fostering a sense of natural continuity within the mystical alterations.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ethereal aura surrounding the spider in Image B is depicted as uniformly enveloping, gently fading into the background environment. Its seamless transition indicates a mindful integration with the backdrop without causing visual disruption. The aura does not interfere with any elements like leaves or web strands, reflecting a smooth compositional integration and enhancing the fantasy ambiance without harsh contrasts.",
