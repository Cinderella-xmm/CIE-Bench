    "Question": "Q4: Are the mechanical wings securely connected to the shoulder armor, matching the metal texture and spike design, and free of unnatural bends or misaligned joints?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not display any mechanical wings attached to the shoulder armor, thus the question regarding their secure connection, texture matching, and joint misalignment does not apply. Since there are no wings present, the analysis focuses on the existing armor and its secure and consistent presentation.",
    "answer": "No"
