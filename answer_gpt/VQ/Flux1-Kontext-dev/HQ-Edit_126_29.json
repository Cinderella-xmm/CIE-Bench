      "question": "Does the book animation on the clock face align perfectly with the curved top and vertical frame of the clock, maintaining consistent proportions and smooth transitions between materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock is depicted as part of an infographic rather than a physical clock with animations. The book motif is not visible, so there is no animation to assess. The clock image aligns with decorative elements but is primarily part of a graphic design. Image A shows a grandfather clock in a room setting without any animation. Therefore, the question of alignment and transition in animation doesn't arise as there is no book animation involved.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the text snippets embedded in the wallpaper clearly legible, evenly spaced, and seamlessly blended into the background pattern without creating unnatural shadows or color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is part of an infographic design on a different background, not within wallpaper. The text appears styled like a newspaper or brochure with varied spacing and legibility issues perhaps for artistic effect, rather than blended into a wallpaper. Image A depicts patterned wallpaper in a room clearly distinct from text displays in Image B, confirming that text embedding into wallpaper is not relevant.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the image of the ancient sundial inside the framed artwork properly scaled, centered, and rendered with consistent lighting and depth relative to the original frame and surrounding wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an illustration of a clock incorporated into an infographic without reference to any ancient sundial set within a framed artwork on a wall. Image A has a complex antique room setting with different furniture and decor, but there's no explicit indication of a sundial, especially in artwork. Thus, Image B doesn't have this feature either to analyze scaling, centering, or depth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the pen-shaped clock hands appear structurally sound, properly aligned with the bookâ€™s cover, and free from distortion such as bent metal parts or mismatched shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a graphic depiction of clock hands as part of a stylized infographic, not pen-shaped hands on a physical clock aligned with a book cover. Image A's setting doesn't have these specific elements either, focusing on a classic room. The question does not apply to the design elements visible in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the captions placed in the room clearly readable, stylistically consistent with art-nouveau design, and physically integrated into their respective surfaces without overlapping or distorting underlying materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the captions are part of an infographic, with multiple stylistic fonts seen in an old newspaper or vintage booklet design rather than related to Art Nouveau or being part of a 3D room setting. Image A shows a classic interior without captions integrated onto surfaces, thus the analysis of text integration into physical layers does not apply favorably in Image B as well.",
