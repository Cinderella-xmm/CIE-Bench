      "question": "Are the brick textures and shapes of the building and the \"LAUNDROMAT\" sign consistent with Lego bricks, without introducing unnatural artifacts or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building's brick textures and shapes are reminiscent of interlocking Lego bricks, characterized by the uniformity and simplicity typical of Lego structures. The 'LAUNDROMAT' sign also appears to fit the Lego style, maintaining clarity and block-like lettering. This transformation retains the design integrity expected from a Lego style without distorting its form or introducing artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the person holding the laundry appear naturally integrated into the Lego-style environment without any visible distortion or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person holding the laundry is transformed into a Lego-style character, marked by the smooth, minimalistic features typical of Lego figures. The seamless integration of the person into the environment matches the visual cues and styling of Lego, making the character look like a coherent part of the Lego-themed scene.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the washing machines and interior elements inside the laundromat look like they are made of Lego bricks, preserving their structural integrity and avoiding broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the washing machines and interior elements maintain the iconic geometric style of Lego constructions. The machines appear simplified yet structurally intact, resembling how Lego pieces would represent such items, avoiding any broken shapes or distorted forms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stack of folded laundry held by the person retain its natural appearance and texture, without appearing as if it is made of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stack of folded laundry follows the Lego aesthetic, with each piece represented as smooth, simplified forms akin to how Lego would simulate fabric. This departs from a natural appearance, instead presenting them as solid, uniform pieces, which is characteristic of Lego construction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the scene, including the person, the laundry, and the laundromat, coherent and visually plausible as a stop-motion diorama crafted in the style of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire scene in Image B is cohesively styled in the form of a Lego diorama, with the person, laundry, and laundromat all reflecting the Lego aesthetic. The consistency across different elements and their integration into the Lego-themed setting make the composition plausible as a stop-motion Lego representation.",
