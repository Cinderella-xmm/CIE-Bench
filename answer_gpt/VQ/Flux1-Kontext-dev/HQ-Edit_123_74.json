      "question": "Is the helmet proportionally enlarged but still maintaining a coherent shape and realistic placement on the head without visible deformation or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet appears well-proportioned and fits naturally on the snowboarderâ€™s head. Its edges follow the curvature and shape typical of a helmet, suggesting realistic proportions and placement. There are no visible signs of deformation or unnatural extensions, indicating that the helmet does not appear to have been disproportionately enlarged in a way that looks unnatural.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural joint alignment and no signs of distortion, stretching, or additional digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the analyzed image, the hands of the snowboarder show clear outlines with fingers positioned naturally around the edges of the gloves. The joints appear aligned, consistent with how fingers are regularly spaced and shaped. There is no visible distortion or unnatural stretching in the fingers, confirming that each hand has five fingers without extra digits.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red tones on the snowsuit vivid but still consistent with fabric texture, without appearing overly glossy, pixelated, or disconnected from the underlying material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowsuit in Image B presents red tones that are vibrant yet retain a consistency with realistic fabric textures. The color saturation does not betray any overly glossy appearance or pixelation. Furthermore, the red looks well-integrated with the overall appearance of the material, embedding seamlessly with the implied wrinkles and fabric contours.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the snow and tree outlines cleanly separated into layered shapes resembling paper cuts, without gaps, overlapping distortions, or floating fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the snow and trees display clear and sharp outlines resembling the precision of paper cut shapes. These layered shapes do not present any unintended gaps or errors that might suggest distortion or misalignment. Each aspect of the snow-capped trees adds to the clean and precise aesthetic, ensuring no floating fragments or overlapping errors are visible.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the snowboarder's body posture aligned with the direction of the snowboard, showing balanced weight distribution and no floating limbs or impossible angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the snowboarder with a posture that aligns cohesively with the snowboard's direction. Her body leans in a manner consistent with maintaining balance while snowboarding, with limbs positioned naturally without signs of floating or being held at improbable angles. The overall body alignment suggests a realistic depiction of a snowboarder in motion.",
