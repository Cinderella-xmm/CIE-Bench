    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the lattice-like scale pattern along the serpent's body follow the spiral curve smoothly without abrupt breaks or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent’s body curves elegantly around the spiral staircase, suggesting a natural and smooth alignment with the shape of the original spiral. The scales have a uniform lattice-like pattern that fits seamlessly along the length of the serpent without visible disruptions, which would indicate misalignment or abrupt transitions.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the individual segments of the serpent's body aligned with the original stair treads such that each segment corresponds to a step in size and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent's body is designed to wrap around the staircase. However, the body segments do not seem to directly correspond to each individual step in terms of alignment. Instead of specifically matching the step size and spacing, the body flows independently of the stair treads.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the translucent fins extend from the original railing position in a continuous, flowing manner without gaps or distortions in their shape or placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The translucent fins on the serpent in Image B appear to originate from the serpent's body and extend fluidly in a natural manner, maintaining continuity, shape, and placement consistent with the railing's original spiral path without evident gaps or distortions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the marble-like texture on the serpent’s body evenly distributed and consistent with the lighting and shading of the original staircase surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent's surface in Image B is designed with a marble-like texture that looks consistent across its body. The lighting and shading appear to maintain continuity with the illumination on the original staircase, using highlights and shadows that match the realistic light source.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the serpent’s head positioned within the circular opening at the top of the staircase without overlapping or deforming the surrounding wall or ceiling structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's head is carefully placed at the top of the spiral staircase, centralized within the circular opening. It avoids any overlapping or deformation of the surrounding architectural elements, suggesting careful attention to spatial integrity.",
