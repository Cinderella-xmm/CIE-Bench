      "question": "Are the color blocks on the comforter smoothly blended and textured to resemble natural fur, with no visible stitching artifacts or abrupt edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the comforter has a distinct appearance where the color blocks are textured to resemble natural fur. This effect is achieved by giving the blocks a fluffy and soft texture, unlike fabric which might show stitching or abrupt edges. The hues smoothly transition, imitating the natural variations seen in fur, and there is no visible stitching or abrupt edges apparent in the edited comforter design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ear-shaped pillows have a natural, upright shape with soft leaf trims that appear securely and organically attached without floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ear-shaped pillows exhibit a well-defined, rounded shape that stands upright, as would be expected of plush, firm pillows. The leaf trims are applied to the ears in a way that appears secure, as they seamlessly attach to the base of the ears without any misalignment or floating appearance. This organized placement and consistency contribute to a natural and cohesive design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the branch-like legs thin, curved, and textured like natural wood, and do they connect correctly to the bed base without appearing broken or disconnected?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows branch-like structures, but instead of resembling wood, they are notably different, appearing as appendages of a plush character with a plush-like consistency rather than wooden. Thus, they lack any fine detail or texture typical of wood. While they do appear to connect correctly to the bed base, their fundamental nature diverges from the description of wood-textured and thin, curved branches.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the red tail extend from the comforter with a rounded, fluffy shape and soft texture, and does it not intersect or clip through the fabric beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a red tail can be observed protruding from the comforter, featuring a rounded and notably fluffy shape that conveys a sense of softness. Its position appears to rest naturally without any visible clipping or intersection through the surrounding fabric, indicating a seamless integration with the rest of the image elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows and lighting on the ears, tail, and branch legs consistent with the ambient light source in the room and do they align with the original bed's position and surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows across the newly integrated ears, tail, and body are consistent with the ambient light source visible in the room. The shadows mimic the direction and intensity of light that seems to illuminate the room like in the original setting from Image A. The designed elements do not detract from the consistent lighting cues already present, reinforcing the image's integrity in the context of its environment.",
