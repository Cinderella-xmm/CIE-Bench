    "Question": "Q1: Are the cogwheel curls integrated into the hairline without distorting the shape of the head or breaking the continuity of the scalp surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cogwheel curls are seamlessly integrated into the hairline, maintaining the overall shape and continuity of the head. This is discerned by observing the uniformity and smoothness in the transition between the cogwheels and the rest of the hair. There are no noticeable disruptions or distortion to the scalp surface, indicating a careful editing process that respects the natural outlines of the head.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the metallic fabric folds follow the natural contours of the shoulders and chest without unnatural stretching or buckling, and are the rivets and tubes placed in physically plausible locations?",
    "explanation": "The metallic fabric folds in Image B drape naturally over the shoulders and chest, resembling the original contours found in Image A, maintaining a believable fabric behavior, even though metallic. The rivets and tubes are strategically positioned, enhancing the realism by being placed in areas like joints or reinforced regions where such elements would logically exist without giving off a sense of imbalance or misplacement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the watch parts and gears attached to the base in a stable and symmetrical arrangement without overlapping or floating elements that violate physical logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the watch parts and gears are symmetrically arranged around the base and chest area. There is no evidence of overlapping parts or components seemingly suspended in mid-air, which suggests a stable and physically logical attachment. This structural integrity contributes to the plausibility and aesthetic harmony of the modified statue.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the monocle mechanism positioned flush with the eye socket and connected to the face via visible but plausible mechanical joints, without altering the shape of the surrounding facial bones?",
    "explanation": "The monocle mechanism in Image B appears flush with the eye area and is connected with realistic mechanical joints that do not disrupt the underlying facial structure or alter the shape of surrounding bones. The integration respects the anatomical layout, lending credibility to its presence despite not being in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the bronze and copper tones uniformly applied across all modified elements, with realistic reflections and no abrupt color boundaries or flat, non-metallic areas?",
    "explanation": "Image B features consistently applied bronze and copper tones over the entire modified sculpture. The reflections and shading are consistent with realistic metallic properties, characterized by smooth gradients rather than harsh transitions, ensuring the entire sculpture retains a cohesive metallic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
