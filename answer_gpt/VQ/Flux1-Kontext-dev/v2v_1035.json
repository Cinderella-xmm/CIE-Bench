      "question": "Do the Russian nesting dolls maintain the recognizable shape and proportions of the giraffe without introducing unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Russian nesting dolls appear to mimic the shape of a giraffe's head and body through the patterns and features painted onto the dolls. The largest doll features the giraffe's facial characteristics, such as the horns, eyes, and snout, effectively mimicking the giraffe look without altering its proportions drastically. The size variation between dolls is typical for nesting dolls, maintaining a consistent design theme without introducing unnatural geometric distortions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the Russian nesting dolls consistent with the giraffe's fur pattern, avoiding unnatural or overly smooth surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls in Image B feature a pattern reminiscent of the giraffe's fur, with dark patches on a lighter background that simulates its distinctive look. While the surface of the dolls is smooth, the painted pattern is very consistent with the giraffe's natural pattern. Given that nesting dolls are typically smooth due to their wooden construction, the design appropriately imitates the giraffe's markings without appearing unnatural.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the different sizes of the Russian nesting dolls smooth, without visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Russian nesting dolls decrease in size progressively, typical of how nesting dolls are designed. The transition between sizes is seamless, and there are no visible gaps or misalignments between the layers and sizes of the dolls. Such smooth transitions are normal, as nesting dolls are crafted to fit snugly within each other.",

      "question": "Does the arrangement of the Russian nesting dolls on the wooden table look balanced and natural, without any dolls appearing to float or overlap unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout of the Russian nesting dolls in Image B is orderly and linear, which is typical for displaying such objects. Each doll stands vertically and rests naturally on the wooden table surface, with no observable overlapping or floating effects. The arrangement of the dolls demonstrates a careful balance across the table.",

      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the Russian nesting dolls and the wooden table consistent with the lighting in the original image, avoiding any unrealistic highlights or dark spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the dolls and the table is consistent, with soft shadows cast in congruence with ambient lighting conditions, without harsh or unrealistic highlights or shadows. Comparing to Image A, where the lighting is suited to a natural outdoor environment, Image B matches indoor settings instead. Thus, the lighting is balanced, ensuring that there are no bizarre or strong shadow contrasts.",
