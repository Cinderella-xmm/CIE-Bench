    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features such as the nose, mouth, and whiskers preserved in shape and position after conversion to bronze, without visible distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the facial features including the nose, mouth, and whiskers would typically be located remains blurred. Therefore, it is impossible to assess whether these features are preserved accurately in bronze without visible distortion or loss of detail based on the image provided. Without evidence to support the retention and positioning of these features, the correct choice is No.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bronze helmet properly scaled and positioned on the head, with smooth transitions at the edges and no visible gaps or misalignments with the skull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a helmet structure that appears smooth and evenly placed without visible gaps or misalignments at the edges, suggesting it is well-scaled and properly positioned on the head. There is coherence in the design, indicating good craftsmanship and the absence of irregularities in transition. Therefore, the correct choice is Yes.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bronze-framed glasses sit correctly over the eyes without shifting or overlapping incorrectly, and do the lenses show realistic glass-like reflection and transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glasses appear to be a part of the blurred section, making it unclear whether they sit correctly over the eyes or if they exhibit realistic glass-like reflection and transparency. Without visible attributes to assess their fitting and characteristics accurately, the correct choice is No.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bronze sweater maintain the original shape and shoulder strap placement, with engraved lines that follow the contours of the garment without breaking or appearing artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any distinct visual representation of a sweater or shoulder strap, making it impossible to evaluate these elements in bronze form. The image provides no detailed lines or contours to ascertain whether they are appropriately preserved. Without evidence, the correct choice is No.",

      "question": "Is the marble base positioned directly beneath the sculpture, with appropriate contact points and no visible gap between the feet and the base, and is it proportionally sized to support the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a marble base directly beneath the sculpture and appears to have appropriate contact points with no visible gaps between the lower part of the sculpture and the marble base. The base seems proportionally suitable to support the figure, indicating stability and correct sizing. Therefore, the correct choice is Yes.",
