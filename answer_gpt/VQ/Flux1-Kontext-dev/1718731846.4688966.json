    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the entire body of the dog exhibit a uniform, polished wood texture with visible grain patterns that follow the contours of the figure, without abrupt transitions or unnatural patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog's body appears to have a smooth surface without detailed grain patterns that would be expected in a polished wood texture. The material looks more like a smooth plastic or similar material rather than wood, which typically shows grain patterns. Therefore, the texture does not align with the description provided regarding polished wood with visible grain patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the black-and-white facial pattern accurately represented by distinct dark and light wood tones along the central vertical line of the face, with no smudging or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial pattern of the dog shows clear divisions between dark and light areas along the central vertical line, suggesting a deliberate design choice. However, the description specifies wood tones with no indication of grain texture, which would typically be expected. The accuracy of tone representation does not reflect the properties of wood. There is no indication that the facial pattern involves wood tones.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features—such as the eye sockets, nose bridge, and mouth outline—accentuated with fine, realistic carved lines that enhance depth without distorting proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features of the dog are clearly defined, but they do not display realistic carved lines consistent with a wooden sculpture. The features appear smooth and rounded without the depth that would be enhanced by carved lines. The material lacks the characteristics of carved wood and appears more synthetic.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all body parts—head, ears, legs, and paws—maintain smooth, rounded contours consistent with the original form, without flattened areas or sharp edges that suggest poor carving?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body parts, including the head, ears, legs, and paws, exhibit smooth, rounded contours that align with the original form of the dog. There are no flattened areas or sharp edges indicating poor carving, as the figure maintains a consistent shape and form throughout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dog placed on a flat, minimalist wooden platform that matches the material tone and finish of the figure, with proper grounding and consistent lighting shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog is positioned on a flat, minimalist platform that appears to be made of wood consistent with a wooden finish. The platform complements the figure's base, ensuring proper grounding. The lighting and shadows suggest a coherent setup where the placement is neat and intentional.",
