    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the butterfly wings formed from the branches have smooth, continuous outlines without visible breaks, warping, or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the butterfly wings have well-defined and smooth outlines. The structure appears consistent, and there are no visible breaks or warped segments along the edges, indicating that the outline creation process was carried out carefully to maintain a seamless look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the luminescent patterns on the butterfly wings evenly distributed with soft edges and no visible digital artifacts like halos or sharp contrast jumps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminescent patterns on the wings exhibit a smooth gradation of colors, transitioning softly without any visible digital artifacts such as halos or abrupt changes in contrast. This suggests that the addition of luminescence was done to create a natural and pleasing visual effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glowing eyes and antlers positioned in a way that respects the original branching structure, with no unnatural overlaps or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the glowing eyes and antlers are properly aligned with the trunk and branches of the bonsai tree, integrating smoothly without any sign of floating or unnatural overlaps. This exemplifies a coherent positioning that respects the bonsai's structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stone base retain natural stone texture, including subtle variations in color and surface depth, without appearing uniformly flat or artificially rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stone base in Image B is textured with visible patterns and color variations that mimic natural stone. The base's detailing adds depth and avoids a flat appearance, thereby ensuring a realistic representation of stone.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bark-like textures on the trunk flow continuously along its contours without sudden breaks, unnatural ridges, or inconsistent scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the bark-like textures seamlessly flow along the trunk's shape, without abrupt breaks or inconsistencies. The texture matches the trunk's contour and appears proportionate, maintaining a natural tree-like appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the remaining leaves, soil, and root structures clearly visible and undistorted, with no blurring, loss of edge definition, or missing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves, soil, and root structures are well-rendered with sharp edges and clear visibility. There is no noticeable blurring, and the details are maintained, preserving the integrity of these elements within the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements cast subtle ambient light on nearby surfaces, and do shadows from the wings, eyes, and antlers align with the sceneâ€™s lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing elements in Image B subtly illuminate nearby areas, and the shadows created by the wings, eyes, and antlers appear to follow the consistent light direction of the scene. This attention to lighting ensures a cohesive integration of the glowing elements within the environment.",
