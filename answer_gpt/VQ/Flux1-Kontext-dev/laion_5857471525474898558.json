    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the LEGO-style bricks on the building facade uniformly sized, aligned in rows, and free from visible texture repetition or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facade of the building is designed in a LEGO-style, which traditionally involves uniformly sized bricks arranged in rows. The bricks appear to be consistent in size and without any visible texture repetition or blurring, which is typical of LEGO constructions. They are aligned in horizontal and vertical rows, reflecting the orderly appearance of LEGO brick buildings.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the window frames appear as solid, blocky LEGO elements with consistent thickness and alignment, matching the original window positions and sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The window frames in Image B are designed to replicate the LEGO block style, appearing as solid and blocky elements. They show consistent thickness and alignment, closely matching the positions and sizes in the original image. This is indicative of the LEGO construction style, where pieces fit together seamlessly.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the green LEGO vines grow along the same vertical paths as the original plants, maintaining segmented, blocky forms without stretching or breaking continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green vines made from LEGO blocks follow vertical paths similar to the original plants in Image A. They maintain a segmented, blocky form consistent with LEGO design and do not show any signs of stretching or breaking, reflecting the modular nature of LEGO construction.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gray LEGO railings on each balcony evenly spaced, horizontally aligned, and securely connected to the balcony base without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gray railings on the balconies in Image B are constructed in a LEGO style, appearing evenly spaced and horizontally aligned. They are securely connected to the balcony base, following LEGO design principles where pieces do not float or overlap. This uniformity is a hallmark of accurate LEGO replication.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a flat, level platform extending beneath the entire building base, positioned consistently with the sidewalk and not overlapping with parked vehicles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building is placed on a flat, level platform that extends beneath the entire base, appearing consistent with the idea of LEGO sets, where buildings are typically placed on uniform bases. It does not overlap with vehicles, reflecting a neat arrangement.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do all architectural elements—including windows, doors, balconies, and rooflines—remain in their original positions and maintain proper alignment and spacing relative to one another?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the original positions of architectural elements such as windows, doors, balconies, and rooflines seen in Image A. The alignment and spacing are consistent, showcasing an accurate transformation into LEGO style without altering the original architectural configuration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO building is well integrated into the scene without visible seams, color bleeding, or sharp edges at the borders with the sky, trees, or cars. The clean transitions suggest high-quality editing that aligns with typical LEGO visuals devoid of sloppy edges.",
