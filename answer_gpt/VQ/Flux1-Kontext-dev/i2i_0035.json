      "question": "Are the colors of the salad, milk carton, chicken parmesan, and oranges enhanced in a way that appears natural and free from obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the colors of the salad, milk carton, chicken parmesan, and oranges appear to be slightly more saturated compared to commonly encountered food images. Saturation enhances visual appeal, which is a typical approach used in food photography. The enhancement does not introduce any unnatural artifacts or distortions, as the colors remain within the expected range for such items. Therefore, the enhancement appears natural.",

      "question": "Does the added title \"Today’s Balanced Lunch\" blend naturally into the image without breaking the structural consistency or introducing any distorted elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title 'Today’s Balanced Lunch' is prominently placed at the top of Image B. While it is clear and legible, it introduces a contrasting color that distinguishes itself from the main content. The title has a different font style and size than the rest of the content, creating a visual separation. However, this does not introduce distortion or break the structural consistency, and it fits within the theme of the image without overpowering other elements.",

      "question": "Do the white outlines applied to the edges of the plate, food items, and text enhance the visual clarity without creating unnatural textures or degrading fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, subtle white outlines are used around the plate, food items, and text. These outlines serve to distinguish each component and enhance their visibility against the background. The technique is commonly used to create visual separation and does not introduce unnatural textures or degrade the details of the image. The outlines are consistent and match commonly used styles in graphic layouts.",

      "question": "Is the placeholder for the school logo placed at the bottom right corner with appropriate size and proportion, ensuring it fits naturally within the layout without disrupting the overall balance of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The school logo in Image B is positioned at the bottom right corner. It has a proportionate size that does not overshadow the primary subject, maintaining the balance of the layout. Logos are often placed in corners to maintain the focus on the main content while still being noticeable, ensuring it fits within the structural composition of such promotional images.",

      "question": "Has the image been resized and formatted for an A4 vertical layout in a manner that preserves the natural proportions and structural consistency of the plate, food items, and text elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is designed with additional graphic elements suitable for a vertically-oriented layout, which is typical for print formats like A4. The proportions are maintained from Image A, with no obvious distortions in the plate, food items, or text. The formatting ensures structural consistency, with all elements fitting naturally within the layout intended for printed media.",
