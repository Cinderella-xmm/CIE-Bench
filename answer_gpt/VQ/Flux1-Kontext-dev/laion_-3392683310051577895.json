      "question": "Do the curled horn-like structures on both armrests have smooth, continuous curves without jagged edges or inconsistent thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the curled horn-like structures on the armrests are artistically designed to resemble horns with a texture resembling bark. The visual cues indicate that these horns have a relatively consistent thickness and a smooth, continuous curve. There are no visible signs of jagged edges or abrupt changes in thickness, suggesting a well-executed design that appears seamless and cohesive.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bark-textured scales on the backrest evenly distributed, with natural variations in shape and depth, and do they follow the original contour of the sofa without tearing or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the backrest covered in a texture that mimics bark. These scales appear to be evenly distributed across the surface. There are natural variations in shape and depth, giving a realistic appearance to the texture. The alignment of these scales follows the contour of the original sofa without any visible tearing or misalignment, indicating that the effect is well-integrated with the sofa's form.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mossy, leafy mane extend continuously from the top of the cushions, showing layered depth and natural variation in green tones, without sharp seams or floating leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mossy, leafy mane in Image B extends from the top of the cushions, exhibiting a layered depth. It shows a range of green tones, contributing to a natural and organic appearance. There are no visible sharp seams or disjointed elements like floating leaves, suggesting that the artistic transformation from the leather surface to this textured appearance is smoothly executed.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the emerald eyes positioned centrally above the middle cushion, emitting a soft, diffused glow that casts subtle shadows on the surrounding leather without harsh outlines or overexposure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the emerald eyes are positioned above the cushions, but the glow is notably intense with a bright emission. This affects the appearance of subtle shadows, as the glow casts a more pronounced brilliance rather than a soft, diffused light. This intensity may create some harshness in outlines or potential overexposure, deviating from a truly soft and diffused glow.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wooden limbs extend from under the front edge of the sofa, resting firmly on the carpet, with vines wrapped around clawed ends that appear structurally sound and proportionate to the sofa's size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden limbs in Image B extend from underneath the front edge of the sofa, making contact with the carpet. At the ends, claws are visible, with vine-like structures wrapping around. They appear structurally sound and proportionate relative to the sofa's overall size, indicating a design that maintains a consistent scale with the furniture.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there faint, localized glows or energy effects near the limbs or eyes that blend into the environment without creating visible artifacts like pixelation or unnatural color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Focusing on Image B, the glow surrounding the eyes is quite intense and may not entirely blend seamlessly into the environment. This high-intensity glow does not feature faint, localized effects but rather a strong, central illumination. There might be visible artifacts due to this intense glow, such as potential sharp transitions and high contrast with surrounding areas, leading to unnatural appearances or digital artifacts.",
