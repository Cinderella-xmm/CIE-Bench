        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the addition of the text is positioned outside the area of the cat, avoiding any direct overlap with the cat's fur, whiskers, and eyes.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Does the integration of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\" into the image avoid logical inconsistencies such as overlapping unnaturally with the cat's fur or appearing embedded in a way that defies common sense?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is strategically positioned as a border and does not overlap the cat's fur. The placement avoids the logical inconsistency of embedding the text within the fur, adhering to common sense placement and integration of text.",
