      "question": "Do the added text elements such as titles and headings appear seamlessly integrated into the scene without introducing unnatural textures or disrupting the surrounding design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text elements such as 'IDEAL HOME' title and additional smaller text have been added. When analyzing the integration of these elements, it is clear they do not blend seamlessly with the image. The font used for the title is starkly white and bold, with sharp edges that contrast with the softer elements of the room, such as the bed and decor. The smaller text below appears to have artifacts in the form of distortion and illegibility, making them seem unnatural and disruptive to the overall aesthetic. Such artifacts and visual discrepancies suggest disruption in the overall design.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and placements of the newly added text elements appropriate, ensuring they do not distort the geometric shapes or disrupt the roomâ€™s layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text elements in Image B appear prominently over the bedroom setting. While the title 'IDEAL HOME' is centered at the top, its size is proportionate for ease of reading but does not necessarily distort the geometric shapes of the room. However, the placement does overlay the painting, a key focus area, which could be seen as disruptive. The smaller text is placed over the bed area, which interrupts the visual flow of the room's layout.",

      "question": "Does the style and material used for the text modules match the room's decor, maintaining a cohesive look without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The style of the text in Image B uses a bold and crisp font that does not align well with the overall warm and relaxed style of the bedroom. The text style is typically used for bold print and magazine covers, focusing more on visibility rather than blending with the decor. In comparison, the room's decor features natural wood tones and a serene aesthetic which is upstaged by the contrasting text style, making the text elements feel out of place.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition of the magazine cover design elements, when placed over the bedroom image, seem visually credible and avoid unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B features text elements that do not convincingly integrate with the underlying bedroom image. The 'IDEAL HOME' title is the only element that maintains some credibility in terms of placement, sitting at the top where a magazine title would typically be. However, the smaller text below exhibits pixelation or distortion, causing visual artifacts that detract from the overall design, undermining its credibility as an overlay. These artifacts are often indicative of poor integration techniques or resolution mismatches between the text and image.",

      "question": "Are the fine details within the added text elements (titles, headings, and price recommendations) preserved, ensuring their clarity and legibility without degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the main heading 'IDEAL HOME' is clear and legible from a distance, the smaller text appears degraded. It exhibits significant distortion, resulting in poor clarity and legibility. Such issues with the text indicate that fine details were not well-preserved during the editing process, possibly due to resizing or applying the text with inadequate resolution. The clarity needed for readable content is compromised, indicating the text elements suffer from degradation.",
