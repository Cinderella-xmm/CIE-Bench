      "question": "Do the bananas retain a natural curvature and texture, avoiding any obvious distortion or unnatural shapes after being redrawn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas are redrawn in a cartoon style, maintaining a recognizable banana shape. The curvature, size, and overall form closely resemble typical bananas, even though the texture is simplified in line with cartoon aesthetics. The bananas appear natural in shape, without significant distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the wooden base and metal stand preserve their material properties and structural coherence, without introducing unnatural textures or breaking geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base and metal stand in Image B are simplified to fit a cartoon style, but they maintain their original geometric shapesâ€”circular for the base and curved for the stand. Despite the cartoon style eliminating the texture details, the structural coherence is preserved as the shapes remain intact and recognizable.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bold outlines around the bananas and stand clear and consistent, contributing to the chibi-style aesthetic without being overly thick or uneven?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas and stand have uniformly bold outlines typical of cartoon or chibi-style illustrations. These outlines are consistent in thickness and contribute to the coherent aesthetic without being excessively thick or uneven, which would disrupt the visual style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the green hill background integrate seamlessly with the foreground elements, maintaining proportional logic and visual coherence without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of simple green hills that are consistent with the cartoon style, providing a harmonious and proportionally logical setting. They do not interfere with the foreground elements and fit well into the overall design, enhancing visual coherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details on the bananas, such as the tips and edges, been preserved in the cartoon redraw, avoiding any loss or distortion that affects the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the details are simplified in Image B to match the cartoon style, the general form and essential features like the tips and edges of the bananas are preserved. This maintains the natural appearance despite the absence of intricate details seen in realistic representations.",
