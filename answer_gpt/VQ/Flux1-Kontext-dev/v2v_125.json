      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In chibi illustrations, characters commonly exhibit oversized and expressive eyes to convey emotion, a staple of the style.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the rider's shirt transformed into a chibi style, featuring simplified lines and shapes.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi characters typically have exaggerated features but are still physically plausible within their stylized context.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi style in Image B portrays the rider with simplified features consistent with the style, including the hairstyle.
