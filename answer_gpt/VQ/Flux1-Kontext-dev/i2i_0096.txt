    "Question": "Q1: Does the sofa maintain its structural integrity and proportions from both the front and side views, avoiding any unusual geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa has a consistent shape and structure. The proportions and geometry are conventional, as evidenced by the even distribution of cushions and a balanced design with symmetry from a frontal view. Common sense tells us that such furniture is usually crafted to maintain its integrity across different viewpoints. Analyzing Image A reveals similar structural integrity and proportions, indicating no unusual distortions in the edited image, retaining its realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the fabric textures and details of the sofa consistent and clear in both the front and side views, without any visible loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "The clarity and consistency of fabric textures in Image B indicate high-detail rendition, which is essential for realism. The fabric appears smooth with visible stitching and cushion folds, typical of a plush sofa. Image A maintains similar detailed textures, ensuring Image B remains consistent with realistic portrayal without any loss.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the cushions and legs of the sofa align naturally between the front and side views, maintaining visual plausibility and coherence?",
    "explanation": "Image B's cushion layout and sofa legs display a natural arrangement, coherent with realistic design principles. Cushions appear adequately placed, contributing to visual plausibility. Observing Image A confirms similar arrangement and coherence, indicating that their alignment in the edited image seems realistic and natural.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the light and shadow effects on the sofa and surrounding area remain consistent and natural when transitioning from the front to the side view?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, shadows and lighting reflect a consistent pattern, suggesting light from a fixed source, such as a window. The sofa's shadows complement this direction, enhancing realism. Comparing with Image A, the same consistency is observed, confirming that Image B has achieved natural light-shadow interplay across views.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the artwork on the wall and the wall itself retain their natural appearance and realism when viewed from both the front and side perspectives?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows artwork with consistent color saturation and texture, adding depth and maintaining realism on a neutral wall. The painting's angles remain unchanged, reflecting realistic artwork placement. Image A confirms these details, emphasizing a natural look and realism maintained across perspectives.",
    "answer": "Yes"
