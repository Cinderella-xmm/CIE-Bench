    "Question": "Q1: Do the luminous panels follow the exact shape and curvature of the original headâ€™s surface without visible gaps or overlapping seams?",
    "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the luminous panels appear to adhere closely to the contours of the structure without visible gaps or seams that disrupt the flow of the shape. The neon outlines in Image B suggest precision in the attachment of these panels to the existing structure. This conclusion is drawn from observing the uniformity and adherence of the neon panels along the sculpture's complex geometric shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the neon animations on the digital panels displayed with sharp, continuous light patterns and no pixelated or fragmented sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the neon animations exhibit smooth, continuous light patterns across the digital panels, indicating high resolution and clarity. This assessment is supported by observing that the light outlines, animations, and design elements on the panels maintain consistent brightness and sharpness, without any signs of pixelation or jagged edges.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the synthetic foliage emit a soft, even glow from within, and do the individual plant forms have defined structure and depth without appearing like flat decals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the foliage seems to emit an evenly distributed soft glow, suggesting internal lighting. The plant forms possess clear outlines and a sense of depth, distinguishing them from flat decals. This observation stems from the lighting that highlights the foliage structure, allowing the viewer to perceive defined shapes and shadows that suggest dimensionality.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the metallic surfaces of the surrounding buildings show accurate reflections and subtle surface variations without distorted grid patterns or stretched textures?",
    "explanation": "Image B features buildings with surfaces that reflect light accurately and demonstrate smooth, subtle texture variations devoid of unnatural distortions or stretched grid patterns. This conclusion is derived from observing the consistent alignment and scaling of these elements, reflecting realistic variations in light interaction on metallic surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the transformed head and pedestal aligned correctly with the horizon and surrounding buildings, showing no angular distortion or perspective mismatch?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed head and pedestal are properly aligned with the horizon and adjacent buildings, which is evident in the cohesive perspective and lack of angular distortion. The alignment is evaluated by observing the parallel lines and the consistent angles between the structure and its environment, leading to seamless integration in the scene's perspective.",
    "answer": "Yes"
