      "question": "Does the white horse maintain its natural texture and lighting, integrating seamlessly into the new forest background without showing any unnatural contrasts or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a white horse within a forest setting. The horse's texture appears smooth, and the lighting complements its features, showing soft highlights on its mane that align with the natural conditions of diffuse light from a forest environment. There are no harsh contrasts or shadows that indicate a mismatch between the horse and its background. Such integration supports the idea that the horse is convincingly placed in the new setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added forest and tree elements visually consistent with the horse's presence, and does the sunlight streaming through the trees create natural highlights and shadows on the horse without unnatural disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The forest setting in Image B is characterized by tall trees and filtered sunlight, which is typical for forest scenery. The light casts on the horse creates natural highlights and shadows, especially noticeable along the horse's back and mane, without showing abrupt light shifts or breaks. This consistency suggests that the elements are harmoniously integrated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the hooves of the horse appear to interact naturally with the forest floor, such as showing realistic mud or leaves, and are there any visible artifacts where the grass meets the new forest ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's hooves appear to make contact with the forest path, suggesting motion and interaction. However, upon closer inspection, the pathway lacks details like mud or leaves that would indicate realistic interaction. Additionally, there appear to be no significant artifacts at the junction between the horse and the forest ground, but the interaction could be enhanced with more texture details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting on the horse's body correctly simulate sunlight filtering through the trees and casting shadows from surrounding forest elements, without any unnatural bright spots or dark patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the horse under conditions suggestive of dappled sunlight filtering through tree branches. The horse's body displays varying degrees of illumination consistent with this effect, without displaying abrupt bright spots or dark patches, implying a realistic interpretation of sunlight and shadow play in a woodland area.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the horse’s leap look structurally coherent with the new forest setting, with appropriate motion blur and a trajectory that suggests a natural leap from within the shadows without any geometric distortions or visual incongruities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse in Image B is captured mid-leap, its body elongated in a natural motion path typical for such action. Given the filtered light and shadow pattern of the forest, the horse’s leap does not show any geometric distortions or visual incongruities that would disrupt its integration with the surroundings. There is minimal motion blur, emphasizing the capture of a still moment in the leap.",
