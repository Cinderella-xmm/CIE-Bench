      "question": "Does the 3D ballerina figure inside the snow globe maintain anatomically correct proportions and joint alignment, matching the original dancer's pose without exaggerated or broken limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina figure inside the snow globe maintains anatomically correct proportions and joint alignment, matching the original dancer's pose without any exaggerated or broken limbs. The figure displays the same elegant and balanced leap as seen in Image A. The leg extensions, arm placements, and overall body posture are consistent with the typical representation of a ballet dancer's leap, showcasing a natural and graceful depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the base of the snow globe display realistic bronze texture with subtle reflective highlights and clearly defined engraved French script, without pixelation or synthetic-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the snow globe in Image B appears to have a realistic bronze texture. The subtle reflective highlights help mimic the appearance of real metal, and the engraved French script is clearly defined, contributing to the authenticity of the design. There is no noticeable pixelation or synthetic-looking patterns, ensuring that the base looks convincingly like bronze material.",

      "question": "Are the snowflakes inside the globe evenly dispersed and varied in shape and size, appearing to float naturally without repeating patterns or clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowflakes inside the globe are dispersed evenly and vary in shape and size, which creates the impression of a natural snowfall effect. This variety in appearance avoids repetition and clumping, enhancing the realism and artistry of the design. The snowflakes float throughout the globe, giving it a dynamic and lively feel.",

      "question": "Are the Eiffel Tower and surrounding Parisian landmarks scaled down appropriately and geometrically intact, maintaining correct perspective and structural details without warping or flattening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Eiffel Tower and surrounding landmarks in Image B are scaled down appropriately and maintain correct perspective and structural details, which is essential for recreating a recognizable scene inside the snow globe. The geometric integrity of these landmarks is preserved, and they do not appear warped or flattened, which indicates a skilled adaptation of the real-world setting into the miniature format.",

      "question": "Does the glass dome of the snow globe exhibit natural refraction and subtle bending of internal elements, with smooth curvature and no jagged edges or abrupt transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome of the snow globe in Image B shows natural refraction and subtle bending of internal elements. The curvature of the dome is smooth, and there are no jagged edges or abrupt transitions. This smoothness and bending of light contribute to the realistic depiction of a glass dome, enhancing the quality of the edited image.",
