      "question": "Do the trench coats and fedoras on all characters have natural fabric draping and proper fit without visible distortion or clipping against limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters do not appear to be wearing trench coats and fedoras. The attire is more along the lines of typical anime clothing, which includes vests and shirts. There is no visible distortion or clipping as the clothing fits the characters in a way that matches typical anime art style. However, the original question appears to expect different attire that is not present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the grayscale foggy cityscape background smoothly blended with the characters, showing consistent atmospheric perspective and no sharp boundaries or lost architectural details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a grayscale format, and it is necessary to consider how the background might blend with the characters. The characters seem to pop out against the background, suggesting a clearer distinction rather than a smooth blending which might be expected were there atmospheric perspective involved. This leads to the conclusion that the blending is not entirely smooth as some separation is evident.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the central character’s hand holding the magnifying glass show five fingers with natural curvature and grip, and is the magnifying glass proportionally sized and positioned as if being used realistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character is not holding a magnifying glass; instead, the character is depicted holding a book. Hence, this imagery does not apply to the question, and there are no relevant aspects of finger curvature or use of a magnifying glass to evaluate.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the eyepatch on the central character’s face aligned with his facial structure and consistently shaded with the surrounding skin and lighting, without appearing detached or unnaturally bright/dark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyepatch on the central character aligns well with his facial structure, appearing integrated with the face. The shading and lighting around the eyepatch are consistent with the grayscale theme, avoiding giving the impression of being detached or having unnatural brightness or darkness compared to the distinctive style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the title “Whispers of Shadows” and subtitle “A Mysterious Journey” displayed in a serif font at the top, properly spaced, readable, and not overlapping any character or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'WHISPERS OF SHADOWS' is in a sans-serif font and is clearly displayed at the top. The subtitle 'A Mysterious Journey' is present, but the style does not feature a serif font, and there is an overlap of the font with some background features. This affects overall readability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the blood-red streaks along the book edges smoothly rendered with uniform color intensity and no visible artifacts such as jagged edges or noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blood-red streaks on the book cover's edges in Image B are observed to be smoothly rendered, with a consistent color intensity that does not present visible artifacts, jagged edges, or noticeable noise, contributing to a uniform visual appeal.",
