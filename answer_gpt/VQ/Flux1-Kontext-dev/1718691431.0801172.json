      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features of the fox mask (eyes, nose, mouth) aligned symmetrically and proportionally, without any stretched or deformed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the fox mask is presented in a stylized, illustrative form rather than a realistic rendering. The mask retains symmetry in the placement of its features, suggesting deliberate artistic alignment. The illustration style embraces traditional ornamentation, maintaining proportional design elements that reflect common artistic conventions for masks. Therefore, the design appears intentional and purposefully stylized, without signs of distortion or misalignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the kimono replaced with clean, geometric motifs that follow consistent lines and shapes, without blurred or fragmented edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kimono in the edited image shows floral patterns replaced by stylized and consistent motifs typical within illustrative art. These motifs consist of clear lines and shapes, presenting a graphic interpretation that adheres to consistent stylization. The transition to geometric motifs maintains clarity with no apparent blurring, reinforcing an artistic choice that avoids fragmentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the colors on the kimono and mask transition smoothly between deep reds, pale pinks, and metallic tones without visible color bleeding or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uses a palette that transitions between deep reds, pale pinks, and metallic tones in a consistent and controlled manner common to illustrative or graphic designs. These colors are laid out uniformly, with no apparent color bleeding or inconsistent shading, reflecting a deliberate stylistic approach to color management.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the kimono retain a natural drape and fold structure, with no unnatural flattening or stretching of fabric that would disrupt physical plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the illustration-styled edited image, the kimono appears more graphic than photographic, prioritizing bold design lines over realistic fabric physics. Despite the illustrative approach, the kimono is depicted with reasonable drapery indicative of traditional kimono folds, avoiding signs of flattening or stretching that would conflict with the intended aesthetic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the fox mask and kimono free from jagged edges, pixelation, or texture seams that suggest incomplete rendering or editing errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts the mask and kimono in a cleaned graphic style, free of jagged edges, pixelation, or seams. This suggests the illustration was deliberately crafted to maintain artistic integrity, avoiding rendering errors typical of unfinished digital edits.",
