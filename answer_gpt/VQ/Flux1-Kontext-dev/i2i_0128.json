      "question": "Do the blue-purple neon lights on the keyboard seamlessly blend with the surrounding environment, avoiding any unnatural glow or oversaturation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the blue-purple neon lights create an intense glowing effect on the keyboard, making the scene appear driven by a specific lighting filter. This kind of lighting can sometimes appear oversaturated or overpowering if not blended seamlessly with the surrounding elements. In Image B, while the neon lights are vivid, they don't dominate or clash with the scene. The transition between the lit and unlit areas is smooth, suggesting a relatively natural integration with the environment despite the dramatic lighting choice.",

      "question": "Are the glowing fingertips free of unnatural textures, keeping the hands' structure realistic and preserving the natural texture and curvature of the fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon lighting is prominently applied to the fingertips, casting a glow primarily in blue tones. Despite this, the structure of the fingers appears consistent with natural human anatomy, maintaining recognizable curves and texture. The neon glow starts at the nails and doesn't distort the fingers' shape, allowing for realistic form retention under strong lighting conditions.",

      "question": "Does the keyboard retain its original shape and functionality, with no visible distortion or breaking of keys despite the addition of neon lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the neon lighting adding a dramatic effect, the keyboard keys themselves remain intact and undistorted. They retain their physical shape, suggesting no impact on the keyboard's functionality or original design due to the lighting effects applied.",

      "question": "Have the details on the laptopâ€™s surface and key caps preserved their sharpness, with no blurring or pixelation caused by the added neon effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neon effects in Image B primarily affect the color and light dynamics but not the clarity or resolution of the image. The surface of the laptop and the key caps maintain their sharpness and detail, with no visible blurring or pixelation that would typically result from aggressive color alterations or low-quality edits.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the blue-purple neon lights on the keyboard interact correctly with the rest of the scene's lighting, creating believable reflections or shadows where appropriate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon lights provide an intense blue-purple glow along the keyboard, which interacts with the scene by casting shadows around the keys and contributing to a low-light ambiance. This effect appears to be consistent, as subtle shadows can be noted on the keys and surrounding areas, hinting at a logical and observable interaction with the environment despite the unique lighting depiction.",
