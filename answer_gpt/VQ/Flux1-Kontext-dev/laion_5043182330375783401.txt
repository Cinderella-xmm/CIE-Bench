    "Question": "Q1: Are the geometric shapes applied to the suit clearly defined, aligned with the contours of the body, and free from jagged or broken edges that disrupt the figure’s natural posture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the suit's contours are bold and precise, aligning well with the figure's body. The geometric shapes, although stylized, follow the suit's structure without causing any disruption to the natural posture. This can be inferred from the smooth and defined lines that create a coherent visual flow, maintaining the integrity of the figure’s posture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Does the chair retain a stable, grounded structure with symmetrical, flowing patterns that align with the figure’s seated position and do not appear to float or tilt unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a chair structure that, despite stylistic alterations, maintains a grounded appearance. The patterns are symmetrical and align well, ensuring visual stability. Observing the flow from the chair's base to the figure sitting on it suggests a well-considered design, avoiding any sense of floating or instability.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the sunset gradient in the background smooth and continuous, with no abrupt color shifts or haloing along the edges of the figure?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the gradient background transitions smoothly from red to orange, enveloping the figure uniformly. The process involves observing the color shifts and ensuring they blend seamlessly without abrupt changes. This observation confirms there is no halo effect or unsightly transitions at the edges of the figure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the metallic silver and blue areas of the suit show coherent highlights and reflections that follow a single light source and avoid repeating textures or unnatural glossiness?",
    "explanation": "The metallic areas on the suit in Image B exhibit highlights that suggest a consistent light source. These reflections align logically across the fabric, which are achieved through skillfully applied shading that harmonizes with the colors and textures, lending a naturalistic appearance rather than an exaggerated or repeated glossy effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the hand on the chair have five distinct fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and are the joints and knuckles proportionally accurate and not distorted by stylization?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the hand with five distinct fingers. The spacing and curvature are realistic, and the proportional representation of joints and knuckles appear accurate without distortion, even taking into account the stylization. This conclusion is drawn from the observation of the hand’s anatomy as it comfortably rests on the arm of the chair.",
    "answer": "Yes"
