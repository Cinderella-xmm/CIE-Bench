    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the spaceship retain a coherent circular shape with consistent proportions, and are the added circular motifs and meander patterns aligned symmetrically without warping or overlapping irregularly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spaceship maintains a coherent circular shape, ensuring that its proportions appear consistent and harmonious. The circular motifs and meander patterns on its surface are symmetrically aligned and integrated into the design without evident warping or irregular overlaps, resulting in a well-balanced visual composition. My world knowledge regarding symmetry and proportionality in design helps in affirming these observations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the painted patterns on the spaceshipâ€™s surface free from digital artifacts, such as jagged edges, unnatural brushstroke textures, or inconsistent color gradients that suggest poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painted patterns appear smooth without noticeable digital artifacts. The brushstrokes on the patterns exhibit consistent textures, and the color gradients transition smoothly without jagged edges or unnatural textures that would indicate faulty rendering. This analysis relies on knowledge of digital art quality and the importance of smooth gradients and textures.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the abstract wave forms in the landscape below continuous and smoothly curved, avoiding sharp breaks or abrupt transitions that disrupt the flow of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows abstract wave forms in the landscape that are continuous and smoothly curved. They flow naturally across the scene, avoiding sharp breaks or abrupt transitions. This continuous flow maintains harmony within the design, which is essential in artistic compositions. My understanding of artistic principles regarding smooth transitions in design supports this conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the colors in the transformed landscape consist exclusively of muted earth tones (e.g., browns, tans, dark reds) without any bright or out-of-place colors like neon greens or electric blues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly features muted earth tones such as browns, tans, and dark reds within its landscape. These colors are cohesive and consistent throughout the artwork, without any inclusion of bright or contrasting colors like neon greens or electric blues. This observation is supported by knowledge about color palettes commonly used in landscape art for maintaining thematic unity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the edited spaceship positioned at a consistent altitude above the abstract landscape, with proper perspective alignment relative to the curved railway tracks below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spaceship is consistently positioned above the abstract landscape, maintaining proper perspective alignment with the curving railway tracks. The perspective gives a coherent sense of spatial arrangement, ensuring that neither the foreground nor background is disproportionately rendered. My understanding of perspective in visual art contributes to assessing this alignment.",
