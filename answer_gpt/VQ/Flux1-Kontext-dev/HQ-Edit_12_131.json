      "question": "Are the moko tattoos on the warrior’s face, chest, arms, and back continuous and free from broken lines or pixelated textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moko tattoos in Image B are visually analyzed for continuity and texture quality. The tattoos appear smoothly rendered across the chest, arms, and other visible areas, showing no signs of broken lines or pixelation common in low-resolution images. The lines are sharp and well-defined, indicating high-quality rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the flax fibers of the piupiu skirt and leg wraps maintain natural variation in length, thickness, and shading without appearing overly smooth or synthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The piupiu skirt and leg wraps in Image B are examined for natural variation in fibers. The fibers show a realistic variation in length and thickness, with appropriate shading that suggests natural material. They do not appear overly smooth or synthetic, indicating attention to detail in digital rendering that mimics natural fibers.",

      "question": "Are the warrior’s limbs positioned naturally with correct joint alignment and muscle tension, avoiding exaggerated or impossible bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The posture and limb positioning of the warrior are analyzed in Image B. The limb positioning appears consistent with natural human anatomy, showing correct joint alignment and muscle tension. There are no visible signs of distortions or unrealistic bends that would indicate abnormal positioning.",

      "question": "Does the carved-wood title banner have realistic wood texture, proper shadowing, and edge integration with the background without appearing to float or clip unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title banner in Image B is evaluated for its wood texture, shadowing, and integration with the scene. It has a realistic wood-like texture with appropriate shadowing that suggests a natural lighting situation. The edges integrate smoothly with the background, and it does not appear to float or clip unnaturally, indicating careful digital design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stat bars in Image B are checked for visibility, spacing, and positioning. They are clearly visible, evenly spaced, and positioned without interfering with the warrior's figure or the background, indicating careful consideration of layout in design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frame edges in Image B are analyzed for their uniformity and reflection. They display uniform thickness and smooth curves, with reflections that are consistent with the scene's lighting direction, providing a realistic feel to the frame.",
