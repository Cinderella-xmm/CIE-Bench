      "question": "Does the character's crouched pose maintain natural limb proportions and joint alignment without exaggerated or distorted angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pose of the character appears to be natural and anatomically correct, with limbs proportionate to the body and joints aligned appropriately.

      "question": "Is the rooftop ledge positioned directly under the character’s feet with consistent shadow direction and material texture that matches the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooftop ledge is directly beneath the character’s feet, supporting her stance. The shadows cast by the character are consistent with the lighting in the image, originating from a spotlight source which seems reasonable given the urban night setting. The material texture of the ledge appears to be consistent with urban environments, mimicking concrete or masonry typical for rooftops.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers and spotlights are scaled to appear realistic within the urban context, giving depth and perspective to the scene. The placement of these elements aligns with the character's elevated viewpoint on the rooftop, and the direction of lighting is coherent, adding to the night-time ambiance without conflicting with the character's spotlight illumination.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the claws exhibit a metallic glint that follows the direction of the spotlight illumination without excessive or misplaced reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the claws do exhibit a metallic glint, which is consistent with their interaction with the spotlight. The reflections are not excessive; they are placed appropriately to suggest a polished metallic surface catching the light and aiding in emphasizing the character's formidable appearance.",

      "question": "Is the speech text clearly visible, properly aligned, and placed in a position that does not interfere with the character’s form or visual balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech text saying 'THE NIGHT AWAITS...' is clearly visible and well-aligned within the frame. It is placed strategically over the character's shoulder, ensuring that it does not obscure or interfere with the character's form or visual composition. It draws attention without disrupting the balance of the overall image.",
