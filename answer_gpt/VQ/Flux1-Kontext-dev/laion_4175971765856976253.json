    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the isometric packaging box have consistent edges, proper depth cues, and accurate alignment with the toy figures without visible warping or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging design in Image B presents an isometric view with clear lines and edges. The box maintains proper alignment with the figures inside, suggesting a well-constructed layout based on perspective consistency. The depth and structure appear well-rendered, producing a visually coherent box without any noticeable warping or alignment issues. Such a presentation indicates a well-executed depiction of physical packaging.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the chibi-style figures inside the box proportionally consistent with typical chibi design rules (e.g., large heads, short limbs) and do they retain identifiable features of the original car and robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figures in Image B are depicted with the hallmarks of chibi design, such as exaggeratedly large heads compared to their bodies. These proportions align with typical chibi design rules. The figures retain distinct features of the original car and robot, such as color palette and basic shapes, while embracing chibi aesthetics. This combination ensures the figures are both identifiable and consistent with chibi styling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the mini tool set, interchangeable helmets, and gear base clearly defined, properly scaled, and positioned without floating or clipping through other elements inside the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features additional components like interchangeable helmets which are clearly positioned in their respective slots. These elements are scaled appropriately relative to the main figures, ensuring they complement the overall design without appearing disproportionate. There is no indication of any floating or clipping through other elements, suggesting a well-rendered representation of how these parts would logically fit within the box.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the external surfaces of the car and robot exhibit consistent metallic textures with natural highlights and reflections, without visible artifacts like blotches or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car and robot both exhibit a sleek finish characterized by smooth, metallic surfaces that capture natural highlights and reflections accurately. The textures convey a polished and realistic appearance without any visible artifacts such as blotches or jagged edges. This indicates a high-quality rendering of the metallic surfaces, maintaining consistent textural representation throughout.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the reflections and lighting on the showcase surface consistent with the direction of light and the materials of the figures, without unnatural glare or shadow mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and reflections in Image B appear coherent and consistent with the presumed directionality of light sources, as seen in the highlights on the toys and the glossy box surface. There is no evidence of unnatural glare or shadow mismatches, suggesting the light sources are appropriately calculated relative to the materials of the figures and their environment, thereby creating a unified visual effect.",
