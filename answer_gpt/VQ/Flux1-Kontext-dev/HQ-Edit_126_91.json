      "question": "Does the transformed lid appear as a smooth, symmetrical compact mirror case with consistent glossy black finish and no visible geometric distortions or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lid of the piano does not show any transformation into a compact mirror; rather, it retains its appearance as a piano lid. It is smooth, symmetrical, and maintains a glossy finish, suggesting it was not edited to look like a compact mirror case. Therefore, the transformation as described does not apply to the piano lid in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the keyboard area replaced with a palette of eyeshadows that shows distinct color pans with natural shading and reflection, without blending artifacts or misaligned geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keyboard area of the piano still shows the traditional piano keys rather than a palette of eyeshadows. The keys are aligned and there are no visual indicators of color pans associated with eyeshadow, which would include distinct areas of color and different shading. Thus, there is no replacement of the keyboard with an eyeshadow palette.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all surfaces of the piano uniformly coated in a glossy black material that reflects light consistently and shows no areas of uneven texture or matte regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the piano with a uniform glossy black finish. The reflection of light is consistent across the piano's surfaces, and there are no visible areas that suggest uneven texture or transitions to matte regions. This consistency in texture and finish reflects high-quality image editing without any noticeable flaws.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the added logo and slogan positioned clearly on the pianoâ€™s body, with sharp, non-blurry typography and proper alignment to surrounding surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo and slogan on the piano are sharp and clearly positioned. The typography is crisp, and there is no blurring which implies high-resolution detail. The placement on the piano body looks intentional and aligned, suggesting careful editing to maintain clarity and proper orientation relative to the piano's surfaces.",

      "question": "Do the piano and its surroundings exhibit consistent lighting, shadow direction, and material interaction, with no floating objects or perspective distortion in the hallway setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano and its surroundings seem to be well-integrated regarding lighting and shadows. The lighting direction and shadows are consistent, enhancing realism. There are no apparent anomalies like floating objects or perspective distortions, indicating that the scene's composition and context remain coherent and visually plausible.",
