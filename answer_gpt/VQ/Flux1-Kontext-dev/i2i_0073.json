      "question": "Does the city skyline in the mirror maintain realistic lighting and contrast, matching the ambient light of the bathroom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the city skyline appears in the bathroom mirror. The bathroom is well-lit with a light above the mirror, and it shows a neutral color scheme. The skyline is depicted with a nighttime cityscape with bright lights contrasting against a dark background. The lighting and contrast of the nighttime cityscape do not match the ambient light of the bathroom, which appears to be more uniformly lit. This discrepancy suggests that the light and contrast of the city in the mirror do not align with the bathroom's ambient lighting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and details in the city skyline clear and sharp, without unnatural blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the city skyline is depicted with clear details, and individual buildings are identifiable, suggesting a sharpness in the image. The nighttime skyline lighting highlights different buildings, and there are no evident signs of pixelation or blurring that would indicate a loss of detail. Such clarity and detail suggest the textures in the skyline are clear and sharp.",

      "question": "Does the skyline fit perfectly within the mirror's frame without distorting the geometric shape or overflowing its borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The city skyline in Image B appears neatly contained within the bounds of the mirror, which is evident from the clean edges where the skyline meets the mirror frame. There is no visual indication of any distortion to the buildings' geometric shapes or any part of the image overflowing beyond the border of the mirror, suggesting a perfect fit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the city skyline in the mirror complement the bathroom's interior without clashing with elements like the marble countertop or fixtures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The city skyline presents a darker theme with a night sky and illuminated buildings, which contrasts with the bathroom's bright and neutral tones of marble and metallic fixtures. While this contrast creates a striking visual difference, it can be seen as a complement through the lens of art and design, where stark contrasts can be used for effect. Nevertheless, it inherently clashes with the lighter and more neutral theme of the bathroom, indicating that it doesn't completely harmonize with the rest of the bathroom's interior aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the original bathroom elements around the mirror (such as the light above and objects on the countertop) unaffected and retain their natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, besides the city skyline that appears in the mirror, the surrounding bathroom elements, including the light fixture above the mirror and objects on the countertop like the soap dispenser and grey vase, appear unchanged. They maintain their original position, color, and detail as seen in Image A. This indicates that these elements retain their natural appearance and are unaffected by the edited skyline within the mirror.",
