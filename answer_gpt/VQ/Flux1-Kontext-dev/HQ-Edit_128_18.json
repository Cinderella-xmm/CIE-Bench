      "question": "Are the green foliage motifs surrounding the giraffe composed of smooth, organically shaped leaves with consistent shading and no jagged edges or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green foliage motifs surrounding the giraffe are designed to appear like smooth and organically shaped leaves, suggestive of a jungle theme. The artwork is likely to have consistent shading and smooth edges to maintain a clean and appealing design typical in product packaging, avoiding pixelation or jagged edges. The visual quality in product design usually aims for consistency to attract consumers.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the animal footprints on the floor follow a logical path from the giraffe toward the edge of the room, with consistent depth and spacing that matches typical animal gait patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal footprints are not present at all since it is a product packaging and not an interior room scene. Therefore, there can be no logical path or consistent depth and spacing to analyze in relation to animal gait patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the clear packaging around each plush toy transparent with visible surface highlights and subtle distortion of the toy’s shape beneath, consistent with real plastic wrap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clear packaging around each plush toy appears to be designed to mimic real plastic wrap by being transparent with visible surface highlights. This design choice is typical in product packaging, suggesting the presence of subtle distortion of the toy’s shape beneath, thereby making it consistent with what one would expect from real plastic wrap.",

      "question": "Are the colorful letters on the wall aligned properly with the wall surface, showing no gaps, blurring, or inconsistent font scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no colorful letters on a wall as it is not a room scene but instead a product packaging. Therefore, there are no concerns regarding the alignment, gaps, blurring, or font scaling relevant to a wall to analyze.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the giraffe retain its original body proportions and soft fabric texture, with no stretching, flattening, or unnatural seams introduced during the transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe retains a recognizable body proportion similar to what would be seen in its original form, with an emphasis on the soft toy fabric texture. The transformation into packaging form would require preserving the aesthetic to appeal to consumers, thus avoiding stretching or unnatural seams. From the visual cues, it is evident that the presentation is intact and appealing, maintaining its proportions and texture.",
