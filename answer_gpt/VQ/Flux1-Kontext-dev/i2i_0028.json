        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person's face is blurred and therefore lacks discernible features or details. In illustration style adaptations, facial features would be expected to follow coherent shapes and shading typically associated with human faces. Due to the blur, it's impossible to ascertain structural coherence or natural shading and texture, failing to retain any identified characteristics.",
