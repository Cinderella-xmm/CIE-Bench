    "Question": "Q1: Does the suit jacket exhibit watercolor-style blue-black tones with smooth transitions and no visible digital artifacts such as jagged edges or unnatural blotches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the suit jacket appears in watercolor-style, which typically involves smooth transitions and blended colors. The tones are blue-black, and the visual look aims for a painted effect. The absence of jagged edges and unnatural blotches suggest the editing process was smooth, aligning with watercolor effects. Such a stylized effect typically avoids digital artifacts to maintain the artistic look.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the golden pinstripes aligned with the suit’s fabric grain and do they reflect light consistently with the surrounding material, avoiding floating or misaligned lines?",
    "explanation": "The golden pinstripes on the suit in Image B are expected to follow the fabric grain, an essential aspect in maintaining realism in a stylized image like this. Consistency in light reflection with the surrounding material ensures uniformity in the image. If the pinstripes were floating or misaligned, they would disrupt the visual harmony. The stylized effect aims to maintain alignment to avoid such inconsistencies.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the pattern on the tie uniformly distributed, maintaining consistent size and spacing across its surface without stretching or repeating errors?",
    "explanation": "The tie in Image B has a pattern that should appear evenly distributed, a typical expectation of quality in both photography and digital edits. Uniform size and spacing indicate good editing work, where the pattern does not suffer from stretching or repeating errors—a common issue if the image was poorly manipulated. The tie is presented as an integral part of the outfit, emphasizing attention to detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the leather-bound border feature realistic texture details such as stitching, grain, and embossed lettering without warping or clipping the subject’s features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the leather-bound border is designed to present realistic texture details, typical of high-quality bookbinding. This includes stitching, the grain of the leather, and embossed lettering. Such elements should appear without distortions like warping, which would reduce realism. The border must also not interfere or clip into the main subject, creating a clear boundary.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the background and surface of the image show a soft, uniform satin paper texture with subtle reflections, avoiding harsh glare or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "The background and surface in Image B are portrayed to have a soft satin paper texture, adding an elegant touch to the image. Subtle reflections on such a texture suggest an intermediate quality rather than a high gloss or matte finish. The aim is to avoid harsh glare or pixelation, which can detract from the intended visual softness and uniformity. This aligns with the overall stylized coverage of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
