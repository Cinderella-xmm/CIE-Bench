      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon locomotive retains the same basic structure as in Image A, featuring a clear outline with all components in proportion, such as the engine, wheels, and cabin. There are no signs of broken or distorted geometric shapes, which ensures structural coherence. The editing process has not altered the fundamental design cues of a typical train locomotive as seen from Image A to Image B.",
