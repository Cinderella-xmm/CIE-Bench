      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the feathers exhibit smooth, continuous gradients of fiery coloration without visible banding, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster's feathers are depicted with vibrant fiery colors that transition smoothly, resembling real flames. The gradient is continuous, suggesting the artist aimed for a seamless visual effect that draws from natural fire. There is no visible banding or pixelation, indicating high-quality rendering. This contrast with banding or abrupt shifts commonly found in lower quality images signals intentional design choices to enhance the visual appeal, confirming a smooth transition.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the rooster seamlessly transitions into smoke-like tendrils with a fluid motion that mimics the properties of fire and smoke. This visual effect is achieved with curved lines that lack any abrupt cutoffs or disjointed segments, indicating a smooth, intentional effect meant to enhance the bird's mythical and fiery appearance.",

      "question": "Are the molten gold accents seamlessly blended into the wing and crest surfaces, showing depth and reflection consistent with metallic material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The molten gold accents on the wings and crest of the rooster in Image B show a seamless integration into the creature's anatomy. The depth and reflective qualities are consistent with metallic materials, suggesting the use of lighting and shading to achieve a realistic metallic effect. The blend is smooth, avoiding harsh contrasts that would disrupt the illusion of molten gold.",

      "question": "Do the flame-like eyes maintain the original eye shape and size, with no distortion of the surrounding facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes resemble flames, but the overall eye shape and size appear consistent with what one would expect from a mythical or artistic depiction. There's no distortion in the facial features around the eyes, keeping the integrity of the rooster's face intact and ensuring that the focus remains on the fiery and mystical attributes without altering the fundamental anatomical structure.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the rune patterns involved in the talons are clear and aesthetically integrated into the design without being oversized or warped. This preserves the natural shape and appearance of the talons, as the patterns enhance the mystical theme without compromising anatomical realism.",
