    "Question": "Q4: Do the abstract bamboo shadows align with the existing light source and cast believable depth without appearing detached, inconsistent, or overlapping incorrectly with the figure or background?",
    "explanation": "In image B, the presence of bamboo does not directly exhibit shadows, typical of illustrative art where depth is suggested rather than dictated by realistic shadowing. The context in which bamboo is depicted assumes light interaction and depth in an abstract manner fitting the style. Despite the lack of shadows, the visual alignment and arrangement maintain consistency, making any implied depth align with illustrative expectations without incoherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"

The panel features watercolor-like elements, marrying with the surrounding environment without introducing harshness or abrupt transitions. Such positioning is coherence with the aesthetics drawn from imagery akin to art in traditional contexts, aligned with natural visual flow.",
