      "question": "Does the transition from the ceiling fan to the snow globe maintain structural coherence without any visible distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fan appears to be contained within a snow globe, which is seamlessly incorporated into the design without any visible distortions or unnatural transitions. The globe's transparent material and the warm glow inside ensure that the fan is clearly visible, with its structural features intact and unaffected by the transition. This indicates that the coherence between the transition from a ceiling fan to placement within a snow globe is well-maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the fan preserved within the snow globe's interior, avoiding any loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the fan encapsulated within a snow globe and retains the metallic texture and intricate details of the fan, like the grooves and the circular structure of its mount. The clarity of the blades and other mechanical parts inside the globe suggests that the fine details are effectively preserved without any loss or unusual textures.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the exterior setting with soft lighting and a warm background complement the snow globe scene naturally, enhancing the overall realism and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B is set against a warm backdrop with soft lighting that complements the scene. The light appears to be seamlessly integrated, reflecting softly off the globe's surface and enhancing the enchanting effect of the scene. The choice of lighting and background color contributes to the realism and aesthetic appeal of the snow globe setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the snow globe and its contents physically plausible, with no distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe and its contents exhibit plausible proportions. The globe itself is uniformly spherical, and the fan retains its proper shape and size within, with no evidence of distortion in its geometry. This indicates an adherence to physically plausible proportions and shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the light passing through the snow globe create delicate shimmering effects on nearby surfaces that appear authentic and do not disrupt the scene's overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The light emanating from the snow globe in Image B creates delicate, twinkling effects inside the globe itself, simulating stars or points of light as they pass through. These effects appear authentic and add to the enchanting feel of the globe, without interfering with the image's coherence or authenticity. This demonstrates the integration of lighting effects that enhance rather than disrupt the scene.",
