    "Question": "Q1: Are the guitar and microphone depicted in a chibi-style 3D design while maintaining their original shapes and proportions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar and microphone have a stylized appearance, typical of chibi or cartoonish designs. However, they maintain their original shape and proportions, with the microphone resembling a traditional stand and the guitar retaining its recognizable outline and components. The vibrant colors and simplified forms indicate a chibi-style design. Chibi objects generally shrink certain features and enlarge others but not to the extent of distorting the overall structure.",

    "Question": "Q4: Does the modified lighting create a warm, intimate ambiance without introducing unnatural highlights or shadows on the guitar, microphone, and other elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is warm, contributing to an inviting and pleasant ambiance. There are no glaring or unnatural shadows that disrupt the harmony of the scene, with all elements—the guitar, microphone, floral arch, and petals—illuminated consistent with the overall lighting pattern. This effect is achieved through soft shadows and even lighting gradients, typical of well-rendered 3D settings.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the guitar and microphone retain their structural consistency and visual credibility despite being transformed into chibi-style 3D designs?",
    "explanation": "Despite adopting a chibi-style design in Image B, the guitar and microphone maintain their structural integrity and visual recognition. Their forms are simplified but not altered to the point of losing their identity as musical instruments. The chibi aesthetic enhances the charm while preserving the necessary elements like the guitar's fretboard and the microphone's stand, ensuring the design remains credible.",
