    "Question": "Q1: Does the patterned textile on the character’s top display coherent geometric shapes, consistent color gradients, and natural fabric-like texture without visible distortions or repeating digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the pattern on the character's top features a mix of geometric shapes such as triangles and eyes, which are proportionally distributed and maintain a coherent form. The color gradients transition smoothly without any noticeable pixelation, suggesting a natural, fabric-like appearance. There are no visible distortions or repeating patterns indicative of digital artifacts. Combining this visual information with what is typically expected of high-quality fabric designs supports the conclusion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the tribal motifs on the gold earrings and necklaces clearly defined, proportionally accurate, and free from distorted edges or unrealistic surface reflections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold earrings and necklaces display smooth, clear definitions typical of detailed artistic representation, indicating they are proportionally accurate and not distorted. The reflections and color differences on the jewelry appear realistic and consistent with the appearance of metallic sheen, adhering to what one would expect from well-crafted jewelry in visual art.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the abstracted umbrellas in the background maintain plausible proportions and spatial relationships, without overlapping or floating inconsistently relative to the market stalls?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the umbrellas are accurately positioned above the market stalls, with each umbrella and pole having appropriate size and alignment. They do not appear to overlap or float awkwardly, preserving the sense of depth and spatial relationships expected in a market scene. By using world knowledge of how such scenes are typically depicted, these observations confirm the umbrellas' placement and proportion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the musical notes distributed evenly and positioned along plausible trajectories around the character’s head, without sharp breaks or abrupt cutoffs in their paths?",
    "explanation": "The musical notes in Image B are artistically placed around the character’s head, following natural, sweeping trajectories that suggest motion or flow of music. The distribution appears even, with no evident sharp breaks or sudden discontinuities that would disrupt the visual path. This design choice adheres to artistic representations of music, where notes are placed to suggest harmony and flow.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the character’s right hand show five fingers with correct proportions, natural curvature, and realistic skin texture, without any missing, duplicated, or misshapen digits?",
    "explanation": "The right hand in Image B displays five fingers that are correctly proportioned in relation to human anatomy. The curvature of the fingers is natural, following common hand positions often depicted in art. The skin texture appears consistent with the rest of the character's body, lacking any anomalies such as missing or duplicated digits or misshapen features. This aligns with the expected depiction of a realistic hand.",
    "answer": "Yes"
