    "Question": "Q1: Does the added poem text blend naturally with the image without causing any visible distortion to the background or bird?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text is added on the left side of the image where the background is predominantly blurred and less detailed. This position prevents distortion to the bird or branch, which are the focal points of the image. However, the text itself appears to interfere visually with the background since it does overlap a bit with the existing lighting effects or the ambiance, causing some disharmony between the original image elements and the added text.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the poem text appear in a position that does not obscure important elements like the bird or branch, ensuring structural consistency?",
    "explanation": "The poem text in Image B is placed at the bottom left corner of the image, where it does not cover the bird or the branch, which are significant elements of the image. This positioning keeps the focus on the bird undisturbed, maintaining structural consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the font and size of the added poem text appropriate, maintaining readability while not overpowering the natural elements of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the font used seems to be relatively large and bold, which might stand out prominently against the subtle and soft background. The readability is clear; however, the size and style overpower the delicate nature of the original image elements, creating a visual imbalance.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the added poem text exhibit a smooth texture that aligns with the lighting and shadow of the original image, avoiding unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The text added in Image B presents a stark contrast to the soft lighting and shadows in the original image. The texture of the text does not align well with the image's natural lighting effects, causing it to look more like an overlay rather than an integrated element. There are also some distortion artifacts with the text, making some words difficult to read.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the final composition, including the added poem text, retain a balanced and harmonious visual layout without disrupting the natural feel of the scene?",
    "explanation": "The final composition of Image B includes added text which leads to a disruption in the harmonious natural feel initially present in Image A. The strong presence of the text does not blend seamlessly with the scene's ambiance, causing an imbalance in the overall visual layout.",
    "answer": "No"
