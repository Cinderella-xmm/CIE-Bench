      "question": "Do the anthropomorphic cardinal and blue jay have proportionally correct limbs and body structures that maintain anatomical plausibility without visible deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anthropomorphic cardinal and blue jay are dressed in human-like Victorian garments, which implies a transformation from their typical avian anatomy to more human-like structures with functional limbs. The cardinal and blue jay retain bird-like heads, ensuring recognition, but their limbs are transformed to fit within the outfits. However, due to their natural anatomy, the transition might not be fully anatomically plausible as birds do not typically have human-like limbs or body shape. The cardinal's and blue jay's proportions may look correct in terms of their attire fitting well, but the underlying structure does not match the typical bird anatomy, leading to potentially visible deformations. This evaluation is based on analyzing the garment fit and considering common knowledge of bird anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Victorian garments worn by the cardinal and blue jay rendered with clear, consistent texture and stitching, free from pixelation, blurring, or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the Victorian garments worn by the cardinal and blue jay appear to be carefully rendered with detailed textures. Each garment has visible stitching details and consistent texture, indicative of high-quality rendering without signs of pixelation or blurring. This level of detailing suggests a focus on maintaining visual fidelity in the materials of the garments, consistent with Victorian fashion aesthetics. The textures appear smooth and intricate, pointing to material consistency.",

      "question": "Are the miniature stage and alcove elements positioned with proper depth and alignment, and do icicles and pine accents adhere to gravitational and spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the alcove and stage elements seem to be thoughtfully crafted to demonstrate depth and spatial logic. The use of shadow and light gives a sense of depth and dimension, with objects such as pine accents aligning logically spatially. Icicles and snow effects appear to adhere to gravity and are positioned naturally on the trees and branches in the alcove. The visual composition maintains balance, suggesting an understanding of depth perception and proper alignment within the scene.",

      "question": "Are all miniature seasonal elements (e.g., ornaments, snowflakes) properly scaled, cast realistic shadows, and aligned with the lighting direction of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seasonal elements in Image B, such as artificial snow, are scaled to fit the tableau well. Shadows are cast in a manner that aligns with the light sources, suggesting attention to lighting direction and realism. These details help to create an immersive scene where all elements are harmoniously integrated, enhancing overall narrative consistency and visual appeal.",

      "question": "Is the split-frame border clean and seamless, with no visible artifacts, distortion, or color bleeding at the boundary between the two scenes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a split-frame border between two scenes like Image A, so there is no direct division within the frame that would require analysis of its seamlessness or any potential artifacts. Rather, Image B consists of two distinct setups in their own alcoves. Thus, while the greeting card-style setup can arguably be considered akin to a split scene, it lacks a literal border where one might look for artifacts or color bleeding. Therefore, the understanding of this layout indicates a fully contained scene without intermediate boundaries or bleed issues.",
