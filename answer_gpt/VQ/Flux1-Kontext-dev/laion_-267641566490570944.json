    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the crystal horns on the dragon head proportionally sized relative to the mountain peak and do they exhibit natural refraction and transparency consistent with crystalline material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon has horns that visually appear as extensions from its head. To analyze their size, we compare them to the scale of the mountain, given their close proximity. The horns are massive and slightly exaggerated, typical of fantasy illustration, and do not exhibit clear crystal qualities like transparency or refraction. They appear solid and opaque rather than crystalline, reflecting artistic choice rather than natural materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ridge lines forming the dragon body show smooth, flowing transitions without abrupt angular bends or disproportionate thickness changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's body is designed with fantasy aesthetics in mind. The ridge lines across its scales are rendered to mimic a smooth, flowing shape, typical of dragon depictions. There are no visible abrupt bends, and the thickness transitions smoothly into different parts of the body, maintaining proportionality and fluid design typical in artistic creations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rocky scales and moss-covered spines distributed in a way that mimics natural erosion and plant growth patterns without repeating textures or uniform spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's scales and spines show an artistic texture that aims to represent an organic, natural look. The scales and spines are somewhat uniform, which can signify an artist's repetition rather than mimicking true natural growth or erosion patterns. There is a blend of textures attempting to mimic these patterns, but they may inherently have some repetition due to the illustrative style.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the dragon tail fade into the mist with a soft gradient, maintaining visibility of form through haze without sharp cutoffs or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's tail indeed appears to fade into the mist with a soft gradient as it blends with the cloud cover at the mountain base. The image maintains a consistent and continuous form, with the tail softly receding into the mist without sudden breaks, showcasing the artist's deliberate use of gradient transition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dragon features align with the sun's position in the sky and match the lighting on surrounding mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a fantasy dragon with shadows and highlights that visually correspond to the sunlit environment of the mountain scene. The sun is low in the sky, as seen by the long shadows on the mountains, and similarly, the dragon features are depicted with highlights and shadows that appear consistent with this lighting direction. This artistic choice helps integrate the dragon into the natural scene realistically.",
