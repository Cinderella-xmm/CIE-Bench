      "question": "Do the crystal facets on the fish's body follow the natural curves and scale patterns of the original wooden carving without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal fish maintains a visually consistent flow of facets that align with the expected natural curves and scale patterns characteristic of a fish's body. Observing the patterns, they are etched without any apparent geometric distortion, adhering closely to a realistic design philosophy. Now, when comparing with Image A, where the fish design is incised into wood, the same flow and design consistency follows from the head of the fish to the tail in Image B, supporting the conclusion. Given that absence of distortions aligns with the wooden version suggests a conscious effort to maintain the organic aesthetics in different materials.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glossy surfaces of the crystal fish uniformly reflective and free from abrupt texture changes or matte patches that break the illusion of fluidity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal version of the fish appears to have been crafted to emphasize a consistent gloss and reflective surface, as is typical for crystal sculptures. The reflections seem smooth and seamless across the entire body without any disruption. This sustains an illusion of fluidity uniformly across the sculpture, indicative of a high-quality crystalline material processed properly. My reasoning follows from understanding crystal craftsmanship where the play of light should be consistent, supporting clarity and continuity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the spiral shape of the fish preserved in the crystal version, with no stretching, compression, or misalignment of segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the fish in crystal maintains its spiral configuration, with each segment appearing proportionate, maintaining the natural artistic expression of a spiraled fish. When comparing it to the original wood carving from Image A, the spiral structure and relation of body parts like fins, tail, and head appear consistent in style and persuasion, evident without any obvious stretching or misalignment that would otherwise disrupt the continuity of the sculpture's appearance.",

      "question": "Does the mirrored pedestal beneath the crystal fish reflect the sculpture accurately, with no visible distortions or missing reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish sculpture rests on a pedestal with a mirrored surface that displays reflection. The reflection appears to be proportional and accurate to the sculpture above it, with a clarity that matches the dimensions and detail of the fish figure. Based on my understanding of physical reflections in mirrored surfaces, the key aspect is fidelity to the subject, which the pedestal exhibits without distortion or missing reflection sections.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details such as the gill lines, eye sockets, and fin textures clearly preserved in the crystal version without fading or smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the crystal version displayed in Image B, intricate details such as the gill lines, eye sockets, and fins are captured with precision. These details remain distinct and sharp, showcasing no signs of fading or smoothing synonymous with crystal artworks requiring delicate etching or mold excellence. Observing the fine detailing in Image A, these critical features are consistently carried over to the crystal form, maintaining the artistic integrity and detail-oriented craftsmanship historically expected of such material conversions.",
