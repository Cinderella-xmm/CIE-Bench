      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the explorer hat placed correctly on the sparrow’s head, matching its scale and shape without deforming the feathers or creating unnatural shadows or seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explorer hat is sitting snugly on the sparrow's head. The hat is proportionate to the sparrow's size, fitting naturally without any apparent deformities in the bird's feathers or shape. Visual cues such as the sparrow not showing distorted lines or uneven shadows around the hat suggest that it is integrated well into the image. Generally, hats placed correctly should match the contour of the head without displacing natural features, which is the case here.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the backpack appear attached to the sparrow’s back with proper alignment and proportion, showing no distortion of feathers or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack is appropriately affixed to the sparrow's body. It aligns well with the bird's back, keeping the natural curvature without altering the feather pattern unreasonably. The shading around the backpack gives a coherent appearance without any sharp or unnatural demarcations against the feathers, indicating a seamless integration.",

      "question": "Are the stylized map elements positioned where the original oak leaves were, maintaining similar shape and spatial relationship to the branch and bird, with no visible seams or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, Image A features oak leaves above the bird. In Image B, a stylized map is presented instead. While the composition has clearly changed, the map elements maintain the spatial relationship previously occupied by the leaves. The integration doesn’t show visible alignment issues or seams, ensuring the elements harmonize with the branch and bird's positioning.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sparrow’s feathers retain their original fluffiness and layered texture, with consistent warm earthy tones that enhance but do not distort natural feather patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the sparrow's feathers exhibit a fluffy and layered texture, akin to naturally observed bird feathering. The use of earthy tones continues from Image A, highlighting rather than distorting the bird's natural beauty and ensuring continuity in feather patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title text clearly visible at the top of the image, using a playful font with swirling elements that do not interfere with the bird or background, and free from distortion or blur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title text 'The Spow's Secret Adventure' is prominently displayed at the top, utilizing a playful font style. Swirling elements enhance its creative appearance without obstructing either the sparrow or the scenic background. The text is clear, without any signs of blur or distortion, fulfilling both aesthetic and functional roles effectively.",
