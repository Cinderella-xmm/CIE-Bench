    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the armor elements on the central figure's torso and arms follow natural human body contours without causing distorted shapes or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor on the central figure's torso and arms appears to be designed in a way that follows the human body's natural contours, maintaining proper proportions without any signs of distorted shapes or broken geometry. The visual cues of the armor shape and alignment with the figure's body suggest it has been well-integrated and adheres to the body's curves, as typically seen in well-crafted imagery or designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the ocean-themed armor on the rightmost figure’s jacket smooth and continuous without visible tiling or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textures on the rightmost figure's armor appear smooth and continuous, without the issues of tiling or unnatural blending. This is observed through the seamless appearance of the armor's surface and the natural transitions in texture, indicative of intentional and coherent design typical in high-quality illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the right hand of the rightmost figure have exactly five fingers with natural spacing and joint curvature, even with armor applied?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rightmost figure’s right hand is visually depicted with five fingers. The spacing between the fingers and the curvature at the joints appear natural and are consistent with typical human hand anatomy, even while wearing armor. The visual understanding suggests realistic configuration and adherence to human physiology standards.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky gradient from the horizon upward smooth and free of color banding or abrupt transitions between orange, blue, and purple hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky gradient in the edited image transitions smoothly from orange near the horizon to blue and purple hues further up. There are no abrupt transitions or color banding observed, indicating a well-blended gradient typical of quality digital art or carefully captured sunset imagery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the typography at the bottom of the image clearly legible, properly aligned, and textured with ocean-spray effects without repeating patterns or sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typography in the edited image is clear and legible, with proper alignment. The texture gives an impression of ocean-spray effects, and there are no repeating patterns or excessively sharp edges, appearing artistically integrated with the theme of the image. The clarity and design are consistent with professional depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the ocean creature motifs on the armor of the leftmost figure small, integrated, and positioned in a way that does not distort the armor’s form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ocean creature motifs on the leftmost figure's armor appear small and integrated into the design, without altering or distorting the form of the armor. The motifs maintain cohesion with the overall aesthetic, adding detail without compromising the intended shape of the armor, as commonly seen in thematic illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the shadows of the figures fall forward onto the rocks in alignment with the sun’s position behind them, and are the silhouettes sharp and unbroken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the shadows of the figures are designed to fall forward onto the rocks, consistent with the sun’s backlighting position. The silhouettes appear sharp and unbroken, reflecting the natural alignment of shadows with light source direction as understood in principles of photography and visual depiction.",
