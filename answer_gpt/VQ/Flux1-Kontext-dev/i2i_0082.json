      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the metallic texture of the badge appear natural without introducing any unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic texture of the badge in Image B shows a smooth and shiny surface, typical of metallic objects. There are no visible pixelation or unnatural artifacts present. The reflection on the metal ring and the frame is consistent with how light would interact with a metallic surface, indicating a natural appearance.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the circular frame of the clock/badge perfectly round, without any visible geometric distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular frame of the badge, including the clock face, is perfectly round with no visible geometric distortion or deformation. This appearance is consistent with how frames are expected to look, maintaining symmetry and proportionality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the hour, minute, and second hands retain their original proportions and alignment, avoiding any distortion or misplacement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hour, minute, and second hands are well aligned and maintain proper proportions relative to the clock's face. There are no signs of misplacement or distortion; the hands point appropriately to the time divisions, ensuring readability and functionality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any inconsistent shadows or reflections on the metallic badge that contradict its physical placement as a keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows shadows and reflections on the metallic badge that are consistent with its placement and expected interaction with light. The reflections follow the flow of the metallic ring and frame, aligning with logical light distribution, which avoids contradictions in physical placement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the border thickness and surface finish of the metallic badge consistent and detailed enough to maintain the image's overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The border of the metallic badge in Image B is uniform in thickness and has a smooth surface finish. This consistency contributes to the image's authenticity and natural appearance, as the metallic texture and border are detailed well enough to reflect realistic craftsmanship.",
