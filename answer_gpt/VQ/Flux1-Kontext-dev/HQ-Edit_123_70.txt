    "Question": "Q1: Are the spectacles positioned correctly over the bear’s eyes without deforming the surrounding fur or causing unnatural lens reflections?",
    "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, there are no spectacles on the bear's eyes, so the question about their positioning and effect on the fur and reflections is not applicable.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the bear’s facial expression show subtle aging features (like wrinkles) without distorting the nose, mouth, or jawline geometry?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict the bear with human-like aging features such as wrinkles. The bear maintains its natural expression without human-aging characteristics, so this is not applicable.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the speech bubble clearly connected to the bear’s mouth and does it not obscure or distort nearby fur or water details?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, no speech bubble is present in association with the bear. As a result, there is no impact on the surrounding fur or water details. This indicates a lack of such an edit.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the transformation chart fit naturally within the bear’s mouth without exceeding jaw limits or causing visible deformations in the mouth structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show a transformation chart within the bear's mouth, therefore no evaluation of fitting or deformation can be made.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the labeled stages in the transformation chart aligned with the river surface and do they cast appropriate shadows or depth cues consistent with the scene?",
    "explanation": "The transformation chart shown in Image B does not appear in the context of the bear's natural scene and is presented independently. Thus, it doesn't involve alignment with the river surface or related shadowing.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the fact box positioned in an open area of the image (e.g., near the riverbank) without covering important details like tree trunks or water flow?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, no additional fact box is placed within the bear and river scene, so no analysis of its positioning relative to important details is needed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the text in the speech bubble and fact box rendered with clean edges and no pixelation or aliasing artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although text is present, it appears as part of a comic-style layout with a blurred face within the context, rather than a speech bubble or fact box within the bear's setting. The text itself has clean edges with no visible pixelation or aliasing artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Do the blue hues in the transformation chart and the brown-green tones in the forest background match the original image’s color grading without noticeable shifts?",
    "explanation": "Image B consists of stylized comic elements not directly comparable to the original photographic-style Image A. Thus, no direct comparison of color grading to match the original can be appropriately assessed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q9: Are the bear’s fur strands and water splashes still visible and detailed around the added speech bubble and transformation chart?",
    "explanation": "Since Image B is comprised of a different edited perspective without direct overlay of speech bubbles or transformation charts within the scene, the bear's fur and water in the original scene's context aren't applicable for this check.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q10: Do both panels occupy their intended regions within the 16:9 frame without cutting off the bear’s legs or the tree line at the edges?",
    "explanation": "Image B divides into two comic panels, focusing on different elements than the original. Given this context, it's impractical to check framing concerns related to the bear or landscape continuity from Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}
