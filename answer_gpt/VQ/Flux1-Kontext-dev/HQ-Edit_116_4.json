      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the transformed lanterns now depicted as balloons with consistent spherical shapes, smooth surfaces, and realistic lighting effects that match their surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects above the scene appear as spherical forms resembling balloons rather than traditional lanterns, indicated by their consistent round shapes and smooth surfaces. They exhibit a lighting effect that matches the surrounding, similar to characteristic reflections found on balloons. This implies integration consistent with the scene's lighting and environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the exaggerated patterns on the kimono display continuous, flowing designs with consistent texture and color gradients that resemble real fabric without visible digital artifacts or breaks in pattern continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a kimono with exaggerated and cartoonish patterns, suggesting a vibrant design, but it lacks realistic texture and color gradients resembling real fabric. The simplified representation fits the cartoon style and presents no obvious digital artifacts, but its cartoonish nature inherently introduces breaks from realistic fabric design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the girlâ€™s face retain anatomically plausible proportions, including correctly shaped eyes, nose, and mouth, with no signs of stretching, misalignment, or incorrect number of fingers on her hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The girl in Image B is depicted in a cartoon style with simplified features, which affects anatomically plausible proportions for a realistic face. Her face and hands match cartoon proportions, but they do not aim for realistic anatomical accuracy, hence features like fingers might not match realistic expectations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the detachable message section at the bottom of the image aligned properly with the card layout, featuring clean borders and consistent shading that matches the overall lighting of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The detachable message section in Image B is cleanly integrated into the card layout, featuring clear borders and consistent shading that matches the cartoon lighting style. It appears well-aligned with the overall image, supporting its cohesive integration without any distortions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the title texts rendered in a bold, traditional-style font with clear strokes, proper spacing, and no visible aliasing or distortion that would suggest poor integration into the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title text in Image B is portrayed in a bold, simplified font style that fits the overall cartoon aesthetic. It is clear and evenly spaced, lacking visible aliasing or distortions, indicating that it is well-integrated into the image without technical issues.",
