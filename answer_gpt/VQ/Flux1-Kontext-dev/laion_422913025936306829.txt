    "Question": "Q1: Are the color blocks applied across the shirt’s surface uniform and sharply defined, with no visible smudging or blending between adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the color blocks across the shirt appear vibrant and sharply defined, distinguishing the different elements of the design. The colors used are bright and high-contrast, such as neon blue, orange, and pink, and there is no visible smudging or blending between adjacent areas. This indicates that the edited image utilizes a distinct color separation technique, which contrasts sharply with any potential blending seen in non-graphic designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the neon-colored patterns repeat consistently across the shirt, maintaining symmetry and alignment with the original layout?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the neon-colored patterns, although vibrant and eye-catching, do not repeat consistently across the shirt. Observing Image A, the design is more intricate and detailed, and Image B's patterns, while using similar elements, are exposed to transformations that affect symmetry and alignment. Therefore, the edited version lacks the uniform repetition and consistent alignment that is present in the original design.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the limbs and torso of the central figure proportionally accurate, with no exaggerated or broken joint lines that violate physical realism?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the central figure's limbs and torso maintain the artistic style of exaggerated proportions and joints common in design illustrations, which may not strictly adhere to physical realism but instead emphasize artistic expression. The proportions do not appear excessively distorted beyond typical artistic representations, notably maintaining a conventional depiction, hence being considered proportionally accurate for the intended design style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the fine details such as facial features, hair texture, and ornamental lines clearly visible and unbroken in the edited version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the detailing—such as facial features, hair texture, and ornamental lines—is stylized in bright neon colors. While these elements are distinct and unbroken, they may appear more abstract and less focused on realism compared to Image A. The vibrancy of the neon effect does make them clearly visible, even if stylized, thus satisfying the condition of clear visibility and continuity in artistic expression.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the central figure properly aligned within the circular frame, with no misalignment or distortion of the bordering geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is placed within a circular and geometric background pattern. While vibrant in color, there isn't a sense of misalignment or distortion compared to Image A. The edited image retains the core layout and arrangement of geometric shapes around the figure, ensuring that the design maintains its structural integrity without noticeable displacement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
