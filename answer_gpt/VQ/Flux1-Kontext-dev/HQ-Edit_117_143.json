      "question": "Does the dancer's silhouette retain natural body proportions and smooth contours without distorted limbs or misshapen joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's silhouette is observed with careful attention to the proportions of the body including the arms, legs, and torso. The limbs appear to be smooth and natural without any signs of distortion or unnatural angles. The posture of the dancer is graceful and consistent with the elegance typical of dance movements. This analysis confirms that the silhouette maintains natural body proportions and smooth contours.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ruffles of the red dress transformed into flame-like swirls with smooth gradients and consistent lighting, avoiding jagged edges or disjointed shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red dress exhibits flame-like swirls particularly towards the bottom where the dress flares out. The transformation into flames is smooth, with a natural gradient that transitions seamlessly from red to orange hues representing flames. The edges of the flames are softly contoured without jaggedness or disjointed shapes, suggesting a fluid motion typical of flames.",

      "question": "Is the golden crescent moon reflection on the ground aligned with the position of the moon in the sky and does it follow realistic light reflection patterns on the tiled surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection of the crescent moon is considered with respect to its placement directly below the moon in the sky. The reflection pattern adheres to realistic physics, reflecting a consistent light source angle on the tiled surface directly beneath it. The alignment and light behavior follows expected norms of light reflections, convincing in its portrayal.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the starry night sky border blend seamlessly with the main sky background without visible edges, repeated patterns, or unnatural star clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a border around the starry night sky. Upon inspection, the transition between the starry background and the border is smooth and seamless, with no jarring edges or abrupt changes in star patterns. The distribution of stars appears natural without clustering or repetition, maintaining a consistent celestial effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dancerâ€™s raised hand show five clearly defined fingers with natural joint angles and no missing or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's raised hand is closely examined. It reveals five fingers, each with natural curves and angles typical of human anatomy. The positions and angles reflect realistic joint movement indicative of an elegant dance gesture, with no signs of missing or additional digits.",
