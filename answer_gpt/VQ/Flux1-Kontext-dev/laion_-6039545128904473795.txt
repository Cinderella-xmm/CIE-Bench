    "Question": "Q2: Do the arms formed from rotor blades have consistent proportions and smooth joints that suggest functional rotation without visible warping or breakage?",
    "explanation": "The rotor blades in Image B are creatively transformed into arms for the robotic drone, maintaining consistent proportions. The joints appear smooth, suggesting they could potentially allow for rotation, aligning with the functional design typically found in mechanical objects. No warping or breakage is visible, maintaining a cohesive and well-integrated appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the spider-like legs connected at the original landing gear locations and do they display coherent joint structures without gaps or floating segments?",
    "explanation": "The spider-like legs in Image B seem to be innovatively placed where landing gear would typically appear on a drone. They exhibit coherent joint structures, looking robust and part of a unified design without gaps or floating segments, creating a believable mechanical extension of the drone.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the lighting on the drone consistent with the futuristic cityscape background, showing appropriate metallic reflections and no harsh transitions between the drone and environment?",
    "explanation": "Image B's lighting matches well with the nighttime cityscape background, presenting metallic reflections on the drone surface that seem consistent with the environment's illumination. There are no harsh transitions between the drone and the background, suggesting realistic lighting integration that enhances the cinematic and coherent visual depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
