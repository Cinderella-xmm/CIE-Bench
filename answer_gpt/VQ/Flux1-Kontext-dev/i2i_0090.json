      "question": "Do the edges and contours of the stapler maintain their smoothness without any jagged or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B (edited image), both views of the stapler display smooth edges and contours. The top and bottom surfaces are rounded and maintain continuous lines, which indicates no presence of jagged or unnatural breaks. This smoothness is consistent with well-crafted plastic or metal products, where the design emphasizes a sleek appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blue color and metallic finish of the stapler consistent across both the front and back views with no visible texture discrepancies or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue color of the stapler is uniform across both the front and back views. The metallic components, such as the staple mechanism and screws, also display a consistent finish without any texture discrepancies. This uniformity matches the expectation for manufactured items where color and texture are designed to be consistent.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the mechanical components such as screws and hinges depicted accurately and consistently between the two views, avoiding any illogical positioning or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical components like the screws and visible metallic hinges are positioned logically and consistently between both views. The screws are placed in realistic and functional locations, and their appearances align with typical design standards for staplers, avoiding distortion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the stapler match the lighting conditions in both views, ensuring a believable three-dimensional effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting conditions generate realistic shadows and highlights that conform with the stapler's shape and material. These visual effects contribute to a believable three-dimensional representation, as the reflections and shading vary appropriately according to the curves and angles of the stapler.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the layout of the stapler's side-by-side views clear and uncluttered, with no distracting or misplaced elements disrupting the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The side-by-side layout of Image B is clear and well-organized. Both views of the stapler are presented without overlapping or misalignment, making it easy to visually compare them without distraction. The arrangement focuses on providing a coherent view of different angles, ensuring the viewer's attention remains on the stapler itself.",
