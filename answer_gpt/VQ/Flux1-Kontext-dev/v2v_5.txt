    "Question": "Q1: Do the zebra's stripes on the chibi character appear consistent with the original pattern without unnatural distortions or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "When evaluating Image B, the zebra's stripes are clearly visible and maintain the classic zebra pattern of alternating black and white. This pattern mirrors natural zebra stripes seen commonly in real-world scenarios. The stripes do not show signs of blurring, distortion, or color mismatch that would indicate loss of detail or unnatural alteration. Image A also displays zebra stripes with a consistent pattern, showing no distortions, which matches the natural pattern seen in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the chibi zebra's interaction with the miniature cake appear natural and free from any obvious artifacts or distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is depicted as sniffing towards the cake. This interaction appears natural as it replicates a common behavior of animals showing curiosity towards objects. The positioning and proximity of the zebra to the cake do not exhibit any visual anomalies or artifacts like pixelation or mismatched shadows, which would suggest unnatural editing. Image A portrays a similar scene with the zebra and the cake in consistent proximity and interaction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the chibi zebra seated on the edge of the Instagram frame in a way that appears structurally coherent and visually credible?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the zebra is positioned within the frame centered alongside an Instagram-style interface, without being cut off or positioned awkwardly. The frame and the zebra's position appear structurally stable and visually consistent. There are no mismatched boundaries or cut-off portions of the zebra, which enhances the credibility of their placement within the frame. Image A doesn't include an Instagram frame, but it showcases the zebra in a stable manner consistent with the depiction in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the inclusion of the username 'ZebraLover' and social media icons blend seamlessly into the scene without disrupting the overall natural appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the addition of 'ZebraLover' and various social media icons on the Instagram-style frame is done without interfering with the visual quality of the main image. These elements appear to be placed within the frame in a way that resembles typical social media interfaces. They are subtly integrated such that they complement rather than detract from the primary focus on the zebra and the cake. Image A does not have these elements, but their addition in Image B is harmonious and relevant to the theme depicted.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the materials used for the chibi zebra and the cake natural in appearance, without any obvious unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the zebra and the cake exhibit textures that are visually believable. The zebra's fur appears realistic, consistent with the texture of real zebra fur, and the cake looks appropriately smooth and dense, similar to a real cake with edible zebra-pattern decor. There is no presence of overly smooth surfaces or rough edges that would suggest unnatural textures. Image A similarly presents the zebra and the cake with natural textures that are congruent with real-world appearances.",
    "answer": "Yes"
