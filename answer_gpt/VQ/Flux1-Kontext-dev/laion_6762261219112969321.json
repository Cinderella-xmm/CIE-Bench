    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the cloud textures on the seat, backrest, and armrests appear soft, layered, and continuous without flat or blocky regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds form the structure of a sofa with textures that visually represent soft, fluffy clouds. The clouds are composed of rounded edges and billowy forms which are characteristic of clouds. By visual observation, there are no apparent flat or blocky regions; the shapes are smooth and continuous which is consistent with natural cloud formations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the wooden frame and legs replaced with branching, flowing wind-like structures that follow natural fluid motion without sharp angles or rigid breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basis of the sofa consists of cloud-like material, suggesting ethereal and soft forms. However, there are no structures that specifically resemble wind-like branches; the entire composition adheres to the cloud form with none exhibiting traditional branching or fluid motion. By comparing to the wooden frame and legs in Image A, which are made from rigid materials, Image B does not have an equivalent wind-like substitute for these parts.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned on the upper cushions with smooth integration into the cloud texture, lacking jagged edges or unnatural color contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays eyes on the sofa, specifically where cushions are present. These eyes have a clean integration with the cloud texture because they do not show any abrupt edges or color clashes with the white cloud material. The black pupils and white sclera are typical eye features that integrate smoothly into the soft, fluffy white background.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the mist trail extend continuously from the back of the sofa with consistent texture and fading intensity, without sudden breaks or unnatural boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a light mist trail emerges from the sofa and exhibits a flowing, continuous form as it extends from the back. It maintains a consistent texture, resembling common mist, which gradually fades out without any breaks or sharp limits. This indicates a natural transition typical of mist in the atmosphere.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall structure of the sofa preserved with proper alignment between the seat, backrest, arms, and base, without visible gaps, overlaps, or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the sofa made from clouds maintains an alignment consistent with typical sofa structures: a seat, backrest, and arms are identifiable. The rounding of clouds creates distinct segments that align properly without visual gaps, overlaps, or distortions, appearing as a cohesive unit similar to a traditional sofa layout.",
