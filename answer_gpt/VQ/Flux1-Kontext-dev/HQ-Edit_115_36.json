    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the golden title banner positioned at the top of the image without overlapping or distorting the cat’s head or the window frame, and does it have a natural metallic sheen that matches the ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden title banner is located at the top of the image, above the cat's head and the window frame. There is no visible distortion or overlap with the cat’s head or the window. The banner has a shiny, metallic appearance that matches the ambient lighting in the scene, suggesting a consistent light source and fitting well with the surrounding elements. The analysis is based on typical placement and rendering of banners in digital imagery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the nameplate located at the bottom of the image without intersecting or deforming the cat’s tail or the wooden floor, and does it have clean edges and consistent material texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nameplate is at the bottom part of the image and is not intersecting or deforming the cat’s tail or the wooden floor. The nameplate maintains clean, sharp edges and has a consistent texture, fitting in with the overall smooth 3D style. This observation is based on the visual separation and neatness typical of nameplates in similar digital art.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the stat bars clearly visible and positioned without overlapping the cat’s fur or the window, and do they use a font and color scheme that match the overall polished, soft 3D art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stat bars are positioned on the right side, away from the cat's fur and the window frame. They are clearly visible, with a font and color scheme consistent with the polished, soft 3D art style of the image. This compatibility is deduced from the matching design elements and harmonious integration common in well-rendered digital art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the metallic trim form a complete, continuous border around the image without gaps, misaligned corners, or unnatural reflections that contradict the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic trim forms a complete and continuous border around the image without visible gaps or misaligned corners. The reflections on the trim are consistent with the ambient lighting in the scene, aligning with natural light physics in digital rendering. This evaluation considers the expected craftsmanship in enhanced digital images.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall image rendered in a consistent semi-realistic 3D style where the cat’s fur, window details, and added elements like the banner and stat bars all exhibit smooth textures and no pixelation, blurring, or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a consistent semi-realistic 3D style, with the cat’s fur, window details, and the added elements like the banner and stat bars all rendered smoothly. There is no pixelation, blurring, or geometric distortions, maintaining the quality and texture typical in high-quality 3D digital art. This consistency and smoothness are derived from observing the entire scene's coherence and attention to detail.",
