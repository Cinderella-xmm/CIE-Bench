      "question": "Do the textures of the bronze sculpture accurately represent the casual clothing and relaxed poses of the individuals without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures of the clothing are detailed and accurately convey the fabric types — a tank top and denim shorts for the woman and a long sleeve shirt and shorts for the man — which are typical of casual beachwear. The individuals' poses, the woman standing with a relaxed posture and the man sitting on the vehicle, are consistent with a casual beach scenario. There are no visible artifacts in Image B that would suggest an unnatural representation of clothing or posture.",

      "question": "Does the bronze sculpture of the white SUV maintain its original structure and proportions without any visible geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the SUV has well-defined shapes and contours typical of a real vehicle. The proportions appear symmetrical and consistent, aligning with standard SUV dimensions, suggesting there are no geometric distortions present in the sculpture.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the gentle waves and sandy beach depicted in the bronze diorama with natural undulations and without any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows waves gently lapping onto the beach with natural undulations. Sandy textures appear smooth and consistent with a real beach environment, disallowing any visual artifacts or unnatural textures that may detract from the scene's natural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the hands and facial expressions of the individuals in the bronze diorama retain natural shapes and details without any loss or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While faces are blurred for privacy, the hands in Image B are clearly defined and naturally positioned — the woman's hands are relaxed, and the man's hands are holding a camera in a plausible grip. No unnatural distortions or loss of detail in hand shapes can be noted, suggesting realism in the sculpture's depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the composition in Image B, the individuals are positioned with the woman beside the SUV and the man sitting on it, matching a typical beach exploration scenario. The placement and proportions are consistent with realistic interaction between humans and vehicle, accurately reflecting traditional compositional standards.",
