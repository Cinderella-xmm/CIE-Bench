    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all spherical and cubic elements converted into LEGO brick shapes with consistent rectangular prismatic geometry, preserving structural integrity and avoiding warped or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spherical and cubic elements appear to be composed of marble with rounded and irregular edges rather than being converted into uniform LEGO brick shapes. The elements show no evidence of consistent geometric transformation into LEGO's rectangular prisms. Therefore, they do not preserve the structural integrity of LEGO bricks and have not been shaped into LEGO-style elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the transformed LEGO bricks exhibit a uniform matte surface finish without specular highlights or reflections that contradict the intended LEGO material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects maintain a shiny, polished finish typical of marble rather than the uniform matte surface finish of LEGO bricks. The presence of specular highlights contradicts the typical appearance of LEGO material, which is generally more muted and non-reflective.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible, proportionally accurate interlocking features (e.g., studs or recesses) on the tops and sides of the LEGO bricks that match standard LEGO design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays marble-like spheres and cubes that do not include any interlocking features typical of LEGO bricks. There are no visible studs or recesses that would allow these objects to interlock in the way standard LEGO bricks do.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all LEGO bricks arranged in a stable, grounded formation on a wooden shelf surface, with no floating or suspended pieces that defy gravity or spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements are placed on a wooden shelf surface. However, some pieces appear to be floating above the surface, defying gravity and spatial logic typical of stable arrangements. This suggests that not all pieces are grounded.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly simplified into a clean, neutral tone without any residual textures, shadows, or depth cues that conflict with the minimalist intent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a wooden texture with visible grains, which introduces textures and depth that contradict a minimalist, neutral tone. The presence of shadows also adds depth cues, indicating that the background is not simplified.",
