      "question": "Do the golden horn-like spikes on the headstock align symmetrically with the neck and show no signs of clipping, distortion, or mismatched angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden horn-like spikes are features of the dragon's head. Given that this is a depiction of a dragon and not a guitar, the concept of a 'headstock,' 'neck,' or 'horn-like spikes aligned symmetrically' does not apply here. Therefore, the answer based on Image B would be related to the symmetry and proportions of the dragon's head features, which do appear symmetrical and aligned with realistic proportions concerning the dragon's anatomy.",

      "question": "Are the luminescent runes clearly visible along the fretboard without bleeding into the wood or appearing as separate floating overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the concept of 'luminescent runes' and 'fretboard' is not directly applicable as the image is a dragon illustration. The dragon's elements, such as scales and patterns on the wings, are clear and integrated into the design without floating overlays. This question, therefore, is inapplicable as it pertains to characteristics of a guitar which the dragon, represented in Image B, does not have.",

      "question": "Do the fiery tendrils originate from the bridge and terminate at the nut, following a continuous and uninterrupted path without gaps or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fiery tendrils originate from the dragon's mouth, indicating fire-breathing, typical of dragon depictions. They are continuous and well-integrated with the dragon's head, illustrating a natural occurrence of flames from the mouth. There are no gaps or floating segments in the fire emitted. Since the 'bridge' and 'nut' relate to guitar components, they do not apply here.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wing structures symmetrical on both sides of the body and covered in evenly spaced, realistic scale patterns without gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon's wing structures in Image B are symmetrical on both sides, designed with evenly spaced patterns and textures. The uniformity and artistic detail in the wing patterns represent well-defined and realistic illustration without noticeable gaps or distortions in alignment, adhering to typical fantasy dragon imagery.",

      "question": "Does the body maintain the original guitar's silhouette while showing consistent dragon-like textures such as scales or ridges, with no visible seams or loss of contour detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a dragon, not a guitar, so directly maintaining the original guitar's silhouette is not applicable here. The dragon illustration features consistent dragon-like textures such as detailed scales and anatomical ridges typical of its depiction, with no visible seams or loss of detail in contour, demonstrating a cohesive and well-rendered character design.",
