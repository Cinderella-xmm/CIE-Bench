    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transparent upper material appear smooth and uniform without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent opacity across the shoe's surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper material of the shoe appears smooth and uniform. The glow effect around the shoe and the overall texture visually suggests consistency without pixelation or jagged edges. This is indicative of high-quality graphical editing where the opacity is appropriately adjusted across the surface to simulate a futuristic, seamless look, often seen in CGI or conceptual artworks.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the neon blue glow around the Swoosh evenly distributed with smooth transitions and no abrupt color shifts or light leaks into neighboring surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon blue glow around the Swoosh appears to be evenly distributed, with smooth transitions that follow the contour of the logo. There are no abrupt color shifts or light leaks into areas that should be unlit, implying a refined use of digital lighting effects and a well-controlled graphical output.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the digital screen on the strap properly aligned with the strapâ€™s curvature, showing clear and stable animation content without pixelation or visual noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital screen on the strap is rendered with a high level of precision. The screen curves correctly in harmony with the strap's shape, maintaining visual and structural consistency. The animation content on the screen appears crisp and clear, free of pixelation or noise, indicative of quality CGI and post-production work.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the digital shoe box exhibit consistent geometry and metallic reflection patterns without warped edges or misaligned holographic layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital shoe box shows consistent geometry with edges and surfaces aligning perfectly to form a symmetrical box structure. The metallic reflections and the holographic layers are well integrated, suggesting that the rendering has been executed with precision, avoiding common anomalies such as warped boundaries or misalignment of holographic effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the shoe box evenly spaced and aligned with the surface contours, without repeating anomalies or misregistration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The geometric patterns on the digital shoe box in Image B are evenly spaced and aligned accurately with the box's contours. There are no visible anomalies or misregistration issues common in poorly rendered 3D graphics, suggesting meticulous graphic correction and enhancement to maintain visual harmony.",
