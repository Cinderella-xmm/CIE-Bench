      "question": "Are the pastel-colored areas of the dancer's leotard and tights smoothly blended without visible color artifacts or unnatural transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's leotard and tights have a pastel color scheme that appears smooth and evenly distributed. There are no visible color discontinuities or transitions that seem abrupt or unnatural. This suggests that the editing maintained the color integrity across the leotard and tights, avoiding any obvious artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the detachable sections around the dancer’s leg maintain consistent thickness and alignment with the leg’s natural curvature, avoiding floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the sticker sections around the dancer's leg are well-aligned with the curvature of the leg. The thickness of these sections remains consistent, and there are no detached or misaligned portions which might indicate a poorly executed cut-out effect. Therefore, the editing successfully maintained the alignment and consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the angular transformations applied to the dancer’s limbs physically plausible, with joints and limbs maintaining correct anatomical relationships and no exaggerated bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pose of the dancer, including limbs and joint orientation, looks natural and similar to classical ballet poses which are often extended and graceful. There are no anatomically implausible bends or exaggerated angles that would appear fictionally altered or impossible in ballet.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the dancer’s sticker figures cleanly integrated onto the journal surface, with shadows and lighting matching the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the stickers of the dancer integrate well with the journal's surface. The edges are crisp, and there are no apparent shadow mismatches or lighting discrepancies between the stickers and the journal surface. The shadows fall as expected, indicating a well-executed integration.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dancer’s hands retain five fingers each, with natural spacing and proportions, and no fused or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the dancer are visible and each retains five fingers. The fingers appear to be naturally spaced and proportionate relative to the hand, and there are no signs of fusion or extra digits. This indicates that the hand detailing was preserved accurately during editing.",
