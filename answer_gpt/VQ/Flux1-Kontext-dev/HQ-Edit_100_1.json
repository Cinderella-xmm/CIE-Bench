    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the tree in the edited image maintain natural branch proportions and trunk thickness relative to the surrounding elements, without appearing unnaturally shrunk or warped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the tree's branches and trunk appear visually consistent and balanced, without noticeable distortion or unrealistic shrinkage compared to the grass and flowers surrounding it. This consistency suggests an intention to maintain natural aesthetics within the framed scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the tree's bark and leaves consistent with natural materials, showing no signs of digital over-enhancement such as repeating patterns or unnatural gloss?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows textured surfaces for the trunk and leaves, reflecting variations resembling natural material properties. There are no visible signs of repeating patterns or digital gloss that would undermine the natural appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the flower patches beneath the tree uniformly distributed and blended into the existing meadow, without visible cloning artifacts, sharp edges, or color inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flower patches under the tree integrate smoothly with the meadow, presenting a soft transition and consistent color palette that matches adjacent areas. The distribution appears organic and without unintended artifacts such as visible cloning lines.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background behind the tree seamlessly blended, with no visible layering lines, color jumps, or flat regions that break the illusion of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background showcases a smooth transition and gradient without disruption by sharp divisions or misaligned layers, maintaining a consistent depth without unexpected flat regions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cloud figures positioned above the scene on thin, non-visible wires, appearing small and light enough to suggest suspension, without overlapping or intersecting with the tree or ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small cloud figures hang from wires, visible above the scene, suggesting a suspended position. They are sufficiently separated from the tree and ground, maintaining visual clarity and independence within the frame.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the wooden frame clearly visible around the scene with consistent material appearance, straight edges, and proper shadowing that indicates a three-dimensional box structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wooden frame with a consistent material texture and straight edges that effectively contour the scene. Proper shadowing is visible, reinforcing the visual impression of a three-dimensional box structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
