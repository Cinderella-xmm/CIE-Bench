    "Question": "Q1: Does the robot's body exhibit smooth, continuous chrome-like surfaces without visible texture breaks or inconsistent material transitions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot body is presented with polished, chrome-like surfaces that show consistent reflection and uniformity. These surfaces appear smooth without visible seams or abrupt transitions indicative of different materials. This suggests advanced manufacturing or design techniques, aligning with the aesthetic of a futuristic robot, and requires a perception of high-tech coherence in visual design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
