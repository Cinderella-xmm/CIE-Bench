    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the olive and dark green LEGO bricks covering the tank's body uniformly aligned and textured, without visible gaps, misaligned blocks, or distorted shapes that break the geometric structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank is covered with dark green LEGO bricks that appear consistently aligned. These bricks create a uniform texture across the entire tank, showing no gaps or misalignment that would disrupt the geometric structure commonly associated with LEGOs. By examining the surface closely, it is evident that the texture is consistently smooth and consistent, characteristics typical of well-aligned LEGO constructions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the colorful LEGO tiger pattern on the front hull maintain the correct proportions and facial features of the original tiger decal, without distortion or missing elements such as eyes, teeth, or stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO tiger pattern on the tank's front hull maintains the essential features seen in artistic renderings of tigers, including eyes, teeth, and stripes. The proportions and facial features are visually similar to common tiger representations. Comparing it to the more detailed tiger painting in Image A, while the LEGO version offers a more pixelated and block-centric representation, essential features such as eyes and teeth remain present, ensuring the tiger retains identification.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the LEGO treads exhibit consistent, detailed texture resembling real tank tracks, with no flattened sections or incorrect spacing between the individual tread segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO treads have a visual texture intended to mimic real tank tracks, with generally consistent spacing between each segment. These LEGO treads focus on maintaining the realistic appearance of tank tracks, without flattened areas. Despite the simplified LEGO construction, they maintain a detailed appearance that successfully interprets real-world tank tread designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO tank fully supported by a smooth, continuous wooden platform that matches the surrounding ground level, with no floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO tank appears to be set on a wooden platform, although directly examining the image suggests it might be positioned on a smooth surface rather than a wooden platform. There are no visible edges indicating misalignment or floating aspects; instead, it rests flatly with the surface. Ensuring a consistent platform is critical for visually supporting models such as the LEGO tank.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the green LEGO brick back panel blend seamlessly with the surrounding environment, showing no sharp edges, unnatural color shifts, or textural inconsistencies compared to the real foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO brick back panel creates an intentionally uniform background with a texture resembling classic LEGO block patterns, accompanied by sharp edges typical of LEGO pieces. Since it is composed of LEGO bricks, these characteristics inherently differ from natural foliage with varied texture and natural color gradations. The LEGO panel inevitably introduces distinct textural inconsistencies and color differentiation, reflected in visible geometric lines and a solid color setup.",
