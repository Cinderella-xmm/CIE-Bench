      "question": "Are there any visible seams or unnatural edges where the watch meets the new steampunk-style background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch appears to be seamlessly integrated with the steampunk-style background. The visual information shows no evident seams or unnatural edges around the watch. This indicates that the editing was done carefully to ensure the watch aligns with its new environment, maintaining a consistent appearance throughout the image.",

      "question": "Does the wristwatch retain its original proportions, geometric shapes, and fine details without distortion in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By analyzing Image B, the wristwatch maintains its proportions, geometric shapes, and fine details, similar to what is typically expected of a watch. There are no visible distortions or alterations that deviate from the expected appearance of a well-crafted watch.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the textures and finishes on the watch's metal band and face appear natural and detailed, matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures and finishes on the watch's metal band and face appear detailed and natural. The reflections and metallic texture are consistent with the appearance of a high-quality watch, although a direct comparison with Image A cannot be conducted without visually inspecting both. However, judging by the details and finish seen, it accurately resembles normal watch materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the wristwatch match the light sources in the new steampunk-style train station background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears warm, consistent with the steampunk-style indoor environment. The shadows cast by the watch align with this light source, leading to a coherent integration with its background. This consistency with the environment suggests that the lighting matches the context of the new setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the original lighting and shadows around the watch been preserved without introducing unrealistic contrasts or overly bright/dark areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadows in Image B seem well-balanced, without any unrealistic contrasts or visibly overly bright or dark areas. They have been integrated with careful attention, consistent with a naturalistic style of light emanating from the lamps and windows in the steampunk-style environment.",
