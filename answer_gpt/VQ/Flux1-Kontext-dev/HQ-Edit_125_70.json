      "question": "Is the logo on the hammer handle seamlessly integrated with no visible texture mismatch, jagged edges, or unnatural color contrast compared to the surrounding wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer handle features a visible logo on the metal part, not the wood. The logo is visually consistent with the surroundings, and there's no indication of texture mismatch, jagged edges, or unnatural contrast. The integration into the metal of the hammer seems appropriate and consistent with the surrounding material. Hence, the logo is seamlessly integrated with no noticeable issues.",

      "question": "Do the letters on the wood shavings follow the natural curvature and thickness of each shaving without appearing flattened, stretched, or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, inspection of the wood shavings reveals no lettering that interrupts the natural flow and texture of the shavings. Each shaving maintains its inherent curvature and appearance without any added letters that seem flattened or floating. The wood shavings in the image keep their natural look, consistent with realistic woodworking debris.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the rustic banner at the top align with the lighting and shadows of the scene, and does its texture appear consistent with natural aged wood or fabric rather than digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banner at the top of the pegboard subtly blends with the scene. Lighting visibly falls on it in alignment with the other objects, and its texture is consistent with the surrounding elements, suggesting it is crafted from wood. The shadows and lighting make it appear as if it is genuinely part of the scene, rather than an overly edited addition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the copper accents on the pegboard evenly lit and shaded, matching the surrounding grayscale tones without creating unrealistic reflections or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the copper accents on the pegboard are examined for lighting consistency. They match the lighting conditions visible throughout the scene without causing unexpected reflections or color shifts. The shading and reflections are in line with the ambient light, lending credibility to their presence in the environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the business card positioned with correct perspective and scale relative to the tools and workbench, and does it cast a subtle shadow consistent with the ambient light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the business card is situated to the right side of the workbench, positioned logically among the various tools. It maintains the correct perspective and scale appropriate to the nearby objects. A shadow is cast subtly beneath it, consistent with the scene's lighting, ensuring it appears naturally placed rather than artificially inserted.",
