    "Question": "Q1: Are the boundaries of the vintage travel case visible and seamlessly integrated into the scene without sudden shifts in perspective or lighting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vintage travel case forms the frame around the scene with the elephant. The boundaries of the case are clearly visible, as they create a box-like structure encapsulating the diorama. The lighting is consistent throughout the scene, and there are no sudden shifts in perspective or lighting, making the integration seamless. Compared to Image A, which depicts a natural habitat setting, Image B cleverly uses the case as a boundary that doesn't disrupt the scene's continuity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the textured resin grass show individual blades with natural variation in length and angle, and does it cast soft shadows consistent with the light source?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the resin grass in the travel case appears to have individual blades with slight variations. The variations in length and angle give a sense of realism to the diorama scene. Observing shadows cast by the grass, they appear soft and consistent with the lighting that seems to be above and slightly angled, matching the light source in the box setup.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the miniature acacia tree significantly smaller than the elephant and placed at a distance that creates a believable sense of scale within the diorama?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the perspective inside the travel case presents a believable miniature setting. The acacia tree is considerably smaller than the elephant, which gives a sense of depth and scale typical in dioramas where spatial relationships are exaggerated to create dimensions within a limited space.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Are the painted clouds located on the inner surface of the lid, showing no specular highlights or depth inconsistencies that would suggest they are floating?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds appear painted onto the inner surface of the lid, evidenced by the lack of specular highlights or shadows that would suggest three-dimensionality or floating. This painting technique is consistent with creating a flat backdrop and differs from Image A which has actual 3D scene elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the brass compass resting flat on the base with a clear reflection and shadow that matches the lighting direction and surface texture?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the brass compass is placed on the case's base. Its surface reflects light in a manner consistent with the lighting direction from above. There is an evident shadow cast downwards, matching the overall lighting texture of the scene, suggesting it rests flat.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the elephant retain natural skin texture, correct limb proportions, and intact tusk curvature without any visible deformation or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays the elephant with defined skin texture and accurate proportions reminiscent of its real-world appearance. The tusks maintain their natural curvature without deformation or digital artifacts, showing consistency with realistic sculpture and diorama standards.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do all objects in the diorama cast shadows in the same direction and with similar softness, consistent with a single light source from above?",
    "explanation": "The lighting setup in Image B causes each element, including the tree, elephant, and grass, to cast shadows that are directed downward with similar softness. This indicates that the scene has a unified lighting source from above. Such uniformity is crucial for preserving realism within the staged diorama.",
    "answer": "Yes"
