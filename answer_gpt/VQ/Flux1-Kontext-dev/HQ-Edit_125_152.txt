    "Question": "Q1: Are the sheet music patterns integrated into the wing’s orange sections without breaking the natural vein lines or causing visible texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although there are musical elements like notes, they are not intruding or integrated into the orange sections of the wings. Instead, the wings remain intact with natural vein lines and no visible music sheet overlays causing artifacts. The musical notes are floating around the butterfly but not disrupting its natural texture or pattern.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the antennae extend from the head in a smooth, continuous curve without unnatural kinks, breaks, or disproportionate length?",
    "explanation": "The antennae in Image B are depicted smoothly extending from the butterfly's head in a consistent, aesthetically pleasing curve. They maintain uniform shape without breaks or disproportionate length, consistent with how butterfly antennae would naturally extend.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the petal shapes of the newly added flowers formed like musical notes but still maintain natural curvature and thickness consistent with real petals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the added flowers and their petals have a clear, natural appearance, with regular floral shapes and configurations. None of the petals appear to intentionally mimic musical notes nor show unnatural shapes perhaps influenced by musical patterns, remaining consistent with real petal curvature and thickness.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the butterfly and surrounding flowers arranged in a balanced circular pattern where each element appears at a plausible distance and angle relative to the others?",
    "explanation": "The arrangement in Image B shows the butterfly and flowers in an organized, visually appealing layout that suggests balance. Although there isn’t an overtly circular pattern, the elements appear distributed evenly, maintaining plausible distances and angles with respect to one another. The overall composition creates a harmonious and balanced visual.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the title text rendered with smooth, continuous strokes and no visible aliasing or jagged edges along the letterforms?",
    "explanation": "The title text in Image B is presented with smooth strokes, clear visibility, and continuous form without displaying aliasing or jagged edges. The choice of font design appears deliberate, emphasizing a fluid and coherent style, maintaining clarity in rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
