    "Question": "Q1: Are the bark textures on the logs continuous and aligned with the original log shapes, showing no abrupt edges or inconsistent scaling?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bark textures appear to be continuous and well-aligned with the log shapes, as they smoothly follow the natural contours and patterns of the logs. There are no visible abrupt edges or breaks in the texture, which is consistent with a realistic depiction of logs and their bark pattern.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the glowing amber eyes fit precisely within the original window openings without distorting the surrounding log structure or spreading light beyond the intended area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing amber eyes are positioned within circular openings on the edited facade. These eyes fit neatly within these spaces and do not appear to distort the log structure around them. The light emanating from the eyes is contained within the intended area, maintaining the structural integrity of the window layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the leafy canopy extend upward from the roof ridge in a natural, gravity-consistent manner, with leaves overlapping logically and not appearing suspended or detached?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the leafy canopy stretches upward from the ridge of the roof naturally, demonstrating how foliage typically grows under gravitational influence. The leaves overlap and cascade downward in a plausible manner, avoiding any suspended or detached appearance, reinforcing a realistic canopy growth pattern.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the vines and moss growing along the logs and roofline in a way that follows natural climbing patterns, with no flat, disconnected patches or unnatural straight lines?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts vines and moss that adhere to realistic climbing and spreading patterns along the logs and roofline. They exhibit continuity in their placement and growth without flat, disconnected patches or unusual straight lines, which commonly occur in areas with dense vegetation growth.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the runes carved into the logs with consistent depth and alignment, following the roundness of the logs and not appearing as flat or misaligned symbols?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, runes, which are intricate designs or carvings, are not explicitly detailed or visible. Therefore, based on the visible elements and editing style, there aren't distinguishable or carved runes, making it difficult to ascertain their depth or alignment consistency.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the forest spirit faces positioned within the original garage door frames, with facial features properly scaled and energy trails flowing outward in a smooth, non-jagged manner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the forest spirit faces are positioned within the garage door frames. The facial features are proportionally scaled to fit the door dimensions, and the energy trails flowing outward appear smooth and continuous, avoiding any jagged or abrupt edges.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are all structural components (logs, roof, canopy, vines, faces) connected seamlessly without gaps, floating elements, or distorted geometry?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows all structural components—logs, roof, leafy canopy, vines, and spirit faces—integrated harmoniously without visible gaps, floating elements, or distorted geometry. Each component connects logically to the others, maintaining overall structural coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
