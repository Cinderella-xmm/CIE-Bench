      "question": "Are the brass gears and copper funnels added to the building's exterior consistent in material appearance, showing realistic metallic reflections and surface details without artificial or pixelated textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image of the observatory shows exterior elements that look like brass gears and copper funnels. From a visual analysis combined with world knowledge, metals such as brass and copper typically have a shiny, reflective quality that reveals surface details and a metallic luster. Through observation of Image B, the added elements appear to reflect light in a consistent manner, showcasing realistic metallic reflections. There are no visible signs of artificial or pixelated textures that detract from the realism of the materials. This indicates a successful rendering of metallic surface details.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the clock faces on the observatory dome maintain correct proportions and alignment with the spherical shape, with no visible warping or bending of clock numerals or hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image reveals several clock faces incorporated into the dome structure. Proper alignment on a spherical surface demands that clock numerals and hands remain uniformly spaced and proportioned to avoid distortion. Reviewing Image B, the clock faces appear correctly proportioned, maintaining appropriate alignment with the domeâ€™s curvature. There seems to be no warping or bending of numerals and hands, suggesting correct rendering without distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the steam emanating from the structure appear volumetric and translucent, rising naturally from vents without abrupt edges or unnatural clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited structured in Image B shows steam rising from vents. A realistic depiction of steam involves a soft, translucent appearance that gradually dissipates, forming irregular, natural shapes. Visually analyzing Image B, the steam seems to exhibit a volumetric, translucent quality, rising smoothly in natural formations from the vents without abrupt edges or artificial-looking clustering. This indicates proficient rendering of steam behavior.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ornamental metal details on the observatory dome continuous and properly scaled, with no gaps, overlapping errors, or jagged edges suggesting incomplete rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The observatory dome displays several ornamental metal details in Image B. These should appear continuous and correctly scaled to maintain design integrity. Upon analysis, the metal details seem consistently scaled with no visible gaps or overlapping errors that would suggest rendering issues. The edges are smoothly executed, which eliminates the presence of jagged or rough discrepancies that commonly hint at incomplete rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the reflection of the building in the water a symmetrical and undistorted mirror image of the edited structure, including all added steampunk elements such as gears, clock faces, and steam vents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluating the reflection of the structure in the water requires it to be an accurate mirror image of the edited structure, maintaining symmetry and clarity of all steampunk components in Image B. Analyzing the reflection, the building including the gears, clock faces, and steam vents are all represented symmetrically and undistorted in the water. This signifies that the reflection remains a faithful representation of the edited structure.",
