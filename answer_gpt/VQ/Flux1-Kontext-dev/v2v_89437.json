      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the checkmark pathway appear naturally tangled without breaking its geometric integrity or introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the checkmark pathway is overlapped by multiple red lines that create a tangled appearance. This addition introduces an unnatural artifact to the pathway which breaks its initial geometric integrity, evident by how the pathway appears chaotic and changes from its original clear checkmark shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the overlapping stamps on the 'We verify your Document' icon visually coherent and free from unnatural textures or excessive clutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, red lines overlap the 'We verify your Document' icon, adding clutter and disrupting the coherence. This results in unnatural textures that obscure the icon and make it visually incoherent, contrasting with its clear presentation in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the red tape motif blend naturally into the orange circular step markers without causing visual disruption or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red tape motif in Image B interferes with the orange circular step markers, causing visual disruption. The added motif competes with the markers and causes a cluttered appearance, resulting in a loss of detail when compared to the clear markers in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the icons and text within the orange circular step markers still legible and structurally consistent after the addition of the red tape motif?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red tape overlays the orange circular step markers, affecting the clarity of both the icons and text. Despite the addition, the icons and text remain legible but not as structurally consistent as in Image A due to the interference of the motif.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the infographic maintained its clarity and sharpness without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red additions in Image B have introduced unnatural textures and elements that obscure the clarity and sharpness present in Image A. These elements contribute to a loss of fine detail and introduce visual noise that impacts the overall perception of the infographic.",
