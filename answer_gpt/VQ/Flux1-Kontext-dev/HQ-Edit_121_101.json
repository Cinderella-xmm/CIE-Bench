      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the sleeves and collar clearly defined with clean, sharp edges consistent with a paper-cut style, and do they feature uniform metallic foil highlights without smudging or color bleed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the sleeves and collar appear to have a textured look typical of paper-cut or embroidered designs, suggesting attention to detail in their creation. The metallic elements seem consistent and integrated, without any visible smudging or color bleeding. In Image A, the patterns are less defined due to lack of texture effects. Given the presence of uniform sharpness and consistency in Image B without visible flaws, the answer is supported by a detailed observation of these features specific to the edited context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the enlarged bow positioned centrally and symmetrically on the jeogori, maintaining smooth fabric folds around it without unnatural creasing or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow on the jeogori maintains a central and symmetric position with the fabric appearing smooth around it. The folds do not show signs of exaggerated distortion. Comparing with Image A, where similar positioning is observed, Image B's bow represents a clean and tidy appearance enhanced by clear edits. The analysis is based on observing the position and fabric continuity around the bow, ensuring natural flow without disruptions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the roof lines and structural components of the background architecture maintain proper alignment and perspective, avoiding skewed angles or floating elements that suggest structural inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a background where the lines of the roof and architectural elements align well with no irregular or floating parts. The perspective is maintained, suggesting consistency and natural alignment. Comparing this with Image A, the same alignment is initially present, but the confirming factor lies in observing the edited context of Image B that ensures continuity and structural coherence within the frame.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the embossed leather-bound panel uniformly textured across its surface, with no visible seams or irregularities where the stamped elements meet the background, and does it provide a consistent depth impression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leather-bound panel exhibits consistent texture across its surface with no visible seams or irregularity. It gives an impression of an evenly embossed finish. This matches real-world expectations of finely crafted leather items, which often display such uniformity. Image A lacks this element entirely, thus the judgment relies solely on the perceived quality and uniform embossing visible in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the chain have exactly five fingers with natural joint curvature and skin texture, and does the chain follow a continuous, non-intersecting path without breaking or appearing detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand appears to have five natural-looking fingers, suggesting a realistic portrayal that includes normal joint curvature and skin texture. The chain follows a continuous path that doesn't seem to break or appear detached from the hand. The observation of Image A corroborates the positioning of the hand but primarily underscores the natural curves and non-intersecting chain path in Image B, ensuring the depiction remains anatomically correct and coherent.",
