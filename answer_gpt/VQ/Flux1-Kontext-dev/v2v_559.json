      "question": "Does the 3D chibi version of the person in the foreground maintain the structural integrity of the suit and cup without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D rendering style preserves the basic structure of the suit and cup, giving them a more stylized, cartoon-like appearance without irregular textures or distortions. The suit maintains a clean, smooth look, and the cup's shape is consistent with what would be expected in such a style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 3D chibi version of the person in the background retain the natural appearance of the suit and the warm glow of the lamp without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the person in the background is rendered in a 3D chibi style, maintaining a smooth and uniform appearance of the suit. The lamp retains its warm glow, similar to what would be expected in a stylized 3D scene without exhibiting any artifacts like jagged edges or pixelation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features and suit details of both chibi characters rendered with sufficient detail and texture to avoid looking unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D chibi rendition imbues both characters with a stylized aesthetic. The details and textures are simplified yet coherent, characteristic of this style. This approach ensures that their appearance aligns with chibi art conventions, avoiding an unnatural look by design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the hands of the chibi characters, especially the one holding the cup, appear proportionate and physically plausible without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands in the 3D chibi image appear stylized but proportionate when viewed in the context of the overall chibi design. The hand holding the cup does not show signs of distortion; instead, it exhibits the exaggerated, yet believable proportions typical of chibi style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the addition of the photo frame around the chibi-style 3D scene enhance the visual credibility and realism of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The photo frame provides a boundary that may enhance the aesthetic appeal by framing the chibi scene like a portrait or depiction in an art style. However, realism is not the goal of chibi art, so while it provides structure, it doesn't necessarily add to realism. The focus remains on stylization rather than trying to mimic photographic realism.",
