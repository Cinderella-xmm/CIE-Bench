      "question": "Does the 3D voxel model of the train maintain its original shape and proportions, avoiding any distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual appearance of the train maintains its streamlined, aerodynamic shape without visible distortion or broken geometry. The characteristic features, such as the rounded front and elongated body, are intact, suggesting a consistent portrayal of the train's design. Comparing Image A, the train in Image B has preserved its proportions well, indicating no distortion. Both exemplify a typical high-speed train design, highlighting symmetry and structural integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the train's surface, such as windows and lights, clear and free from unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts adequate detail on the train's surface, with windows and lights appearing clearly defined and appropriately textured. The elements maintain a realistic look, avoiding any unnatural textures that would detract from the authenticity in representation. Analyzing Image A, similar clarity and detailing exist, reinforcing the accurate portrayal of the trainâ€™s surface features in Image B.",

      "question": "Do the materials and colors of the 3D voxel model train match the style of the icons, ensuring a natural and consistent appearance with the rest of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train's white body with red stripes matches the clean and realistic color style of the scene. The colors are consistent with the sophisticated and modern look typical of high-speed trains. When compared to Image A, the colors and materials of the train in Image B are similarly harmonious with its environment, indicating a consistent match in style.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the 3D voxel model train and the real-world elements seamless, without introducing any visible artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows seamless integration of the train into the station environment, maintaining visual consistency. The transition between the train model and station elements, such as tracks and platform, is smooth with no visible artifacts or inconsistencies disrupting the scene. Comparing with Image A, both images depict the train naturally in its setting, suggesting intact integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement and orientation of the 3D voxel model train within the station platform appear natural and consistent with the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is positioned naturally on the tracks, maintaining correct orientation and alignment with the platform. It appears realistically as if ready for departure or arrival, consistent with the spatial arrangement of the environment seen in a typical train station. When compared to Image A, Image B continues to maintain natural placement and orientation, reaffirming its realistic integration into the scene.",
