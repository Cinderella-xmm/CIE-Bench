      "question": "Does the glass display case appear transparent and free of unnatural textures or distortions that would make it look artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display case in Image B shows clear reflections and light behavior consistent with glass objects. It does not exhibit any strange distortions or textures that would make it look artificial. This is inferred from the realistic representation of the light bouncing inside the display case, and the clear view of the museum environment through the glass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the light focused on the dogâ€™s face well-integrated with the environment, without introducing noticeable shadows or highlights that disrupt the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the dog's face is soft and consistent with the surrounding ambient lighting of a museum. There are no harsh shadows or excessive highlights that break the visual coherence of the exhibit setup. The integration between the dog's face and the museum lighting is natural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dog remain proportionally consistent within the new museum exhibit setup, avoiding any distortion or deformation in its physical structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog's proportions in Image B appear natural and realistic, consistent with its appearance in a regular setting. The lack of distortion or deformation suggests that the dog's image has been seamlessly integrated into the exhibit setup without altering its natural structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the informational label about the breed and story appear naturally placed, with no jagged edges or abrupt transitions that suggest poor integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The informational label in Image B is neatly placed below the dog's exhibit, with clear text and smooth edges. There is no evidence of abrupt transitions or jagged edges that would suggest it was poorly added to the scene. This reflects careful integration into the setup.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the dog, such as fur texture and facial expression, maintained with clarity and authenticity, without becoming overly smoothed or pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog's fur texture and facial expression in Image B are depicted with high detail and realism. The texture remains sharp, and the expression is clear, avoiding any signs of over-smoothing or pixelation. This suggests that the finer details have been preserved in the edited image.",
