      "question": "Are the handwritten notes and highlighted dates on the calendar pages clear and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the handwritten notes on the calendar pages are mostly clear, but there's some noticeable distortion around September 8th, where smudges or unclear text indicate alterations or visual disturbances. This is in contrast to Image A, where the details and text appear clear. The distortion in Image B suggests that the clarity of these elements has been compromised.",

      "question": "Do the textures of the paper and desk appear natural and consistent with the lighting and shadows in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paper texture looks natural, with consistent grain and structure, and the lighting across the calendars and desk is uniform, showing smooth shadows. Energy-efficient lighting typically results in smooth gradients of shadow without harsh distinct lines, which matches our common understanding of indoor lighting conditions. This appears consistent without visual inconsistency compared to Image A.",

      "question": "Are the calendar pages arranged neatly without any unnatural breaks or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the calendar pages in a visually coherent layout, without sudden jumps or logical misalignments among the pages. Papers appear scattered but follow a natural arrangement that aligns with the visual perspective commonly seen in such settings. Comparing with Image A, the arrangement remains similar and lacks any unusual overlaps or breaks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the text and grid lines on the calendar pages sharp and well-defined without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluating Image B, the text and grid lines on the calendar pages are generally sharp and clear, except around September 8th where there's visible blurring or distortion, suggesting that detail has been lost in this specific region. Comparing this to Image A, where the lines are more precise, indicates the loss of detail in Image B can affect the clarity significantly in particular areas.",

      "question": "Are the colors of the handwritten notes and highlights consistent and natural, without any unnatural color variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color of the handwritten notes and highlights appears natural and bright, similar to those generally used for emphasis or categorization in real-world settings. There are consistent tones like blue for 'Birthday,' red for 'Wedding,' and they are visually uniform compared with Image A, maintaining the naturalness without abrupt color variations.",
