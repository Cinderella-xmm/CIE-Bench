    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the embroidered patterns on the butterfly’s wings and body aligned with the original gemstone positions and do they display consistent thread density and color without visible breaks or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on evaluating the alignment and quality of embroidered patterns on the butterfly’s wings compared to gemstone positions. Despite the blurred face, the thread density appears consistent and colors are uniform with no visible misalignments or breaks, indicating high-quality embroidery that aligns well with the original gemstone positions seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the butterfly’s body and frame appear made of soft fabric with no visible metallic shine or rigid edges, and does it show natural fabric folds or drape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is depicted as having soft, fabric characteristics, with no visible metallic shine or rigid edges. The blurred appearance suggests natural fabric folds or drape, conveying a softer texture in contrast to the metallic look in Image A, which has a shiny, rigid appearance.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wing surfaces exhibit a uniform, matte, soft-textured appearance consistent with velvet, with no shiny spots or reflections resembling gemstones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a matte finish and soft texture on the wing surfaces, consistent with velvet. There are no shiny spots or reflections indicating gemstones as seen in Image A, suggesting a deliberate edit to replace glossy areas with a softer, fabric-like texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the fluffy trim along the wing edges evenly distributed, soft, and attached in a way that follows the wing’s natural curve without appearing detached or uneven?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fluffy trim along the wing edges can be seen as soft and evenly distributed. It appears attached naturally along the wing’s curve, with no signs of detachment or unevenness. Image A displays the wings without trim, indicating this feature is added in the edited version.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the butterfly’s wings symmetrically shaped, the body proportionate to the wings, and the antennae correctly positioned and curved, with no visible warping or scaling errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B is blurred, it can be detected that the butterfly maintains symmetry, the wings are proportional to the body, and the antennae seem correctly positioned and curved. Image A similarly shows these proper proportions and positioning, indicating no warping or scaling errors in either image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the butterfly resting on a smooth, uniformly pearl-white cushion with a natural shadow underneath, indicating proper contact and physical grounding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly rests on what can be deduced as a smooth, uniformly pearl-white surface, with a natural shadow underneath suggesting stable contact and grounding. This contrasts with Image A where the butterfly is on a green, textured surface, indicating a change to a more uniform cushion-like appearance in the edited image.",
