      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the road sections composed of clearly defined angular shapes that align logically with the perspective and curvature of the original road, without floating or misaligned fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road is depicted with angular shapes that appear to follow the perspective and curvature of a typical road. The visual cues, such as the lines on the road and its edges, maintain consistency with the winding path and do not present any floating or misaligned fragments. The analysis shows that despite stylization, the components align logically with the road's layout, reflecting real-world understanding of road structure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cloud formations consist of layered quadrilateral shapes that overlap in a way consistent with atmospheric depth, without abrupt edges or disconnected blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's cloud formations are composed of angular quadrilateral shapes that provide a stylized view of cloud layers. These shapes overlap in a manner that suggests depth in the sky, similar to real clouds that display depth and layering. There are no abrupt edges or disconnected blocks that would disrupt this perception, showing consistency with common sense understanding of atmospheric depth.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the telegraph poles rendered as angular or geometric structures that maintain vertical alignment and proportional relationships between the pole and crossbars, without visible warping or structural collapse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the telegraph poles are drawn as angular structures featuring vertical alignment and proportional relationships between the poles and crossbars. The clear geometric forms show no visual issues such as warping or collapse. This depiction corresponds with the world knowledge of how telegraph poles are structured, ensuring realistic portrayal in the stylized setting.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tree canopies represented as solid triangular or pyramid-like shapes that sit naturally on the ground and do not float above the terrain or intersect with the road guardrails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree canopies are portrayed as solid triangular shapes that clearly rest on the ground. These shapes do not give the impression of floating or intersecting with road guardrails. This organization of elements adheres to our understanding that trees are grounded, reinforcing logical spatial relations within the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors across the road surface, sky, and surrounding vegetation uniformly distributed within the specified muted palette, without isolated bright spots, color bleeding, or textural noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a composition where colors from the muted palette are applied uniformly across the road, sky, and vegetation. The visual analysis shows no isolated bright spots or instances of color bleeding and textural noise. The uniformity of colors supports the intended style, which resonates with the realistic approach of muted palettes used for artistic consistency.",
