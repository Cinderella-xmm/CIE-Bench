      "question": "If motion trajectory lines were added around the horse, would they appear naturally integrated with the environment without disrupting the image's authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is altered into a motion sequence of a running skater that gradually becomes a horse, indicating movement across different frames. Adding motion trajectory lines could enhance the perception of movement, syncing well with the natural beach setting, thus integrating effectively without disrupting authenticity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "If a skater was added near the house in the background, would the scale and perspective match the existing scene correctly, maintaining structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is presented across multiple frames, each depicting a dynamic motion. Placing a skater near the house would require considering the proportionate size relative to the house and surrounding objects. Given that the skater's position both in Image B and potentially near the house matches the existing perspective of distance, structural consistency is likely maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "If the skater's three motion phases were imposed over the sea and land, would the transitions between these phases look smooth without introducing artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phases of a person transforming into a horse demonstrate smooth transitioning in movement across the sandy terrain. Extending this concept over the sea and land could risk texture distortion or artifacts due to reflective water surfaces. However, given the execution in Image B, these transitions would likely remain smooth and consistent with natural surroundings, avoiding artifacts.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Would the details of the horse's fur texture and the surrounding grass remain visually coherent and undistorted after adding the skater's motion trajectory?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is transformed seamlessly with a dynamic motion, preserving details within the frames. Adding motion trajectories might overlay additional visual elements but would not inherently disturb the existing horse fur and grass texture. The natural setting and the intelligent integration of movement would retain coherence and avoid distortion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "If the skater's starting motion frames were placed in this scenic setting, would the composition maintain balance and coherence without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows the skater's motion frames across the landscape, ensuring each frame retains a balance with the scene's natural setting. Given the seamless progression of motion, maintaining placement within this scenic setting enables continued coherent composition and avoids a disjoint conflict with the background.",
