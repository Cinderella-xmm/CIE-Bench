      "question": "Does the addition of the text “Master Chef” and “Final Round” appear naturally integrated without disrupting the overall visual balance of the plate and spoon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text “Master Chef” and “Final Round” are in white and positioned on a black background, with 'Master Chef' at the top and 'Final Round' at the bottom surrounding the plate. The text's alignment balances the circular plate in the center, maintaining the focus on it while adding context. The font choice is bold, providing clear contrast against the background without detracting from the central spoon and plate. Hence, despite the added elements, the overall visual balance of the image remains centered on the plate and spoon.",

      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts or unnatural textures introduced in the image due to the text overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the text “Master Chef” and “Final Round” overlaid on a plain black background surrounding the central image of a plate with a spoon. The text appears sharp and integrated without any pixelation, distortion, or misalignment. There are no visible artifacts or unnatural textures disrupting the image quality, suggesting that the overlay process has preserved visual aesthetics successfully.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the text sizes for “Master Chef” and “Final Round” seem proportional and appropriate compared to the scale of the plate and spoon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the size of the text “Master Chef” and “Final Round” is large enough to be read clearly but does not overwhelm the central image of the plate and spoon. The top text “Master Chef” occupies a substantial part of the background while leaving adequate space for the plate and spoon to stand out. Similarly, “Final Round” is curved around the bottom, adjusting well to the circular orientation without crowding the main objects. The scale appears thoughtfully balanced, ensuring the texts are visible and complementary to the image focus.",

      "question": "Does the font style chosen for “Master Chef” and “Final Round” complement the simplicity of the white plate and silver spoon, maintaining visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the font style for “Master Chef” and “Final Round” is bold and clear, providing a modern look that matches the sleekness of the plate and spoon. The white color of the text against the black background contrasts with and complements the simple elegance of the silver spoon resting on a white plate. The choice of font and colors maintains visual cohesion and credibility by emphasizing minimalism and clarity.",

      "question": "Has the circular shape of the plate remained intact and undistorted despite the addition of the text elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a plate that remains perfectly round and central despite the text additions. The text “Master Chef” and “Final Round” are placed in such a way that they do not interfere with or warp the plate’s shape. By evaluating Image B independently and considering that the text is clearly positioned on the black background border, it is evident that the plate retains its original circular shape and is undistorted.",
