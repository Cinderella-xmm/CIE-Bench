      "question": "Does the outer box retain the rich mahogany color and wood grain texture that matches the original clock's frame, without unnatural shifts in tone or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outer box features a deep reddish-brown color consistent with mahogany wood. The texture is smooth, with visible wood grain patterns that resemble the ornate clock frame in Image A. Upon comparison, both items possess a similar rich tone and fine texture without any noticeable shift or inconsistency. This suggests that the box maintains the same level of craftsmanship and material appearance as the clock frame.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the modern watch positioned centrally within the box, with its face size and numeral style proportionally consistent with the original clock’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch is centrally placed within the box, appearing well-aligned and framed by the interior lining. The watch face includes Roman numerals and hands resembling those of the clock in Image A; however, the size of the watch face appears smaller relative to its containment than the original clock face. While the style is consistent, the proportions differ slightly since the clock's larger face dictated its design.",

      "question": "Does the interior lining appear as a continuous, seamless velvet surface with no visible artifacts, tears, or irregularities in texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a box with an interior lining that appears smooth and continuous, made from a fabric resembling velvet. There are no visible seams, tears, or texture irregularities present in its presentation. The material seems to cushion the watch comfortably, suggesting high-quality lining, and its seamless nature implies attentive finishing work, indicative of luxury products.",

      "question": "Is the engraved plaque positioned directly below the watch, flush with the base of the box, and does it display clear, non-distorted text or markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The engraved plaque in Image B is positioned directly below the watch inside the box. Visually, the plaque rests flush with the box’s base, complementing the overall design. The text and markings on the plaque appear sharp, legible, and well-placed, showing no signs of distortion or blurring. This precision indicates careful engraving likely intended to mirror the elegant presentation of the clock's features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the baroque decorative elements on the box fully detailed and three-dimensionally rendered, with consistent lighting and shadowing that match the original clock’s relief?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box displays a decorative motif; however, it is modest compared to the lavish baroque elements seen on the clock in Image A. The decorative element on the box is more a refined emblem than an intricate relief, lacking three-dimensional depth. Differences in design, including less complex shadowing and dimension, distinguish it from the richer, more detailed carvings on the clock.",
