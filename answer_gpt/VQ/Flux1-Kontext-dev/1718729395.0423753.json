    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the angel's facial skin retain smooth, consistent texture and natural coloration without artificial halos, pixelation, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to intentional pixelation, the facial area does not retain a smooth and consistent texture. The pixelation interrupts the natural skin texture, showcasing unnatural highlights and coloration. Therefore, the answer must be 'No'.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added ornate garments visually integrated with the figure’s body, showing realistic draping, fold depth, and material consistency without floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ornate garments in Image B align well with the typical visual traits of period garments, where we see appropriate draping, reasonable fold depth, and consistent material texture. This suggests careful integration of the garments with the figure's body, without any visual disruptions or disconnections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the wings appear as subtle, layered highlights that follow the natural curvature of the feathers without creating sharp, unnatural glares or breaking feather edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold accents on the wings in Image B seem to enhance the natural shape without disrupting the feathers' curvature. They are applied in a way that respects the feather structure, without causing sharp glares or breaking the feather edges, making them look integrated into the natural design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the angel’s figure and the new celestial background smooth, with consistent lighting direction and no abrupt edges or mismatched depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the angel and the background appears smooth. Lighting seems consistent and matches the figure’s illumination, with no apparent abrupt edges or depth mismatches, indicating a harmonious integration with the celestial background.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands show five fingers each with natural joint alignment, proper shadowing, and skin texture without swelling, extra digits, or unnatural contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands in Image B are depicted with five fingers each, showing natural joint alignment, realistic shadowing, and consistent skin texture. There are no visible issues like swelling, extra digits, or unnatural contours, which confirms the hands are realistically rendered.",
