    "Question": "Q1: Is the teapot proportionally scaled down while maintaining its original shape, surface details, and structural coherence?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot sits under a glass dome on a platform surrounded by smaller porcelain cups, indicating that it has a similar design theme. It retains a consistent shape, intricate surface details, and appears coherent in structure, similar to common practices where decorative tea sets are presented in proportional harmony without altering the original teapot design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the porcelain cups arranged around the base in a balanced, non-overlapping manner, and do they appear to be made of realistic ceramic material with appropriate reflections and shadows?",
    "explanation": "The porcelain cups in Image B are arranged around the base in a balanced manner, not overlapping each other. Their surface displays appropriate reflections and shadows, indicative of realistic ceramic material properties. The arrangement follows symmetry often seen in professional catering or display settings.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the glass dome show accurate light refraction and surface reflections, allowing clear visibility of the teapot and surrounding elements without visual distortion or artificial glare?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B reflects and refracts light accurately, evident from the smooth, clear surface. It allows clear visibility of the teapot and surrounding elements without causing visual distortion or artificial glare, which aligns with the characteristics of well-rendered glass display cases in images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
