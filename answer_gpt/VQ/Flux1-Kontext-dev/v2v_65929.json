      "question": "Do the sugar-coated machines retain their original geometric shapes and proportions without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the machines have been given a sugar-coated appearance, which includes vibrant colors and textures resembling candy. The shapes and the overall structure of the machines appear to remain consistent with what would be expected of industrial equipment, maintaining their geometric integrity and serving the same functional layout. This suggests that the original geometric shapes and proportions have not been distorted in the editing process.",

      "question": "Does the texture and color of the gingerbread walls look natural and free from unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The walls in Image B are designed to mimic a gingerbread-like appearance with a warm, brownish tone and possible decorative details that evoke icing or candy. However, without unusual artifacts such as excessive pixelation or unrealistic shadows, these textures and colors need to appear seamlessly integrated into the environment for a natural look. From the available cues, the texture does seem to mimic gingerbread surfaces plausibly given the context.",

      "question": "Is the river of flowing chocolate smooth and visually plausible without disrupting the scene's structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The river of chocolate in Image B appears to flow smoothly across the floor without evident pixelation or structural inconsistencies that could disrupt the coherence of the scene. Its placement and flow suggest careful integration into the industrial space, extending through the machinery in a realistic manner without visual disruption.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the lollipops and candy canes on the ceiling trusses integrated naturally without introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of lollipops and candy canes involves replacing or complementing the ceiling structure elements with exaggerated candy forms that should feel part of the space without jarring textures or lighting issues. Since there are no signs of these being overly artificial or contrasting drastically with the scene's lighting, they seem integrated convincingly.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the giant sweets produced by the machinery appear proportionate and realistic within the candy factory setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the machines seem to present a playful candy-themed transformation. For this theme, produced sweets should look adequately scaled to match the scale of industrial machinery. Since the machinery itself remains reasonably sized and consistent with industrial expectations, any oversized sweets produced should look equally proportionate within this transformed setting.",
