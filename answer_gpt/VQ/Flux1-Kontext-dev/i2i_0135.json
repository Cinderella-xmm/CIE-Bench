      "question": "Does the right-side skier maintain a natural texture and appearance without visible artifacts where he appears to slide out of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the skier on the right side demonstrates clear and consistent texture across his clothing and equipment. The image does not show any distracting artifacts typically associated with poor editing, such as jagged edges or color mismatches. World knowledge of proper image editing techniques suggests that skilled adjustment preserves natural appearance without introducing anomalies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the right-side skier's body and equipment preserved, avoiding any distortion or unnatural bending in the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric shapes of the skier's body, ski poles, and skis appear consistent and undistorted. Typically, poor editing can cause visible bending or misshaping of these elements, which is not the case here. The preservation of shape integrity is consistent with well-executed editing where proportions remain logical and true to real-world physics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shadow cast by the right-side skier remain consistent with the light source and appear naturally elongated or altered appropriately due to the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadow of the skier on the right is consistent with the direction of sunlight, as evidenced by the shadow being elongated in the appropriate direction relative to the sun in the image. Knowledge of light behavior under natural conditions corroborates that shadows cast in such conditions should be similarly elongated, confirming naturalness without alteration.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the snow texture around the right-side skier smooth and uninterrupted, without showing signs of unnatural blending or disruption from the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the snow texture surrounding the skier in Image B, there is no evidence of unusual blending or disruption. The snow maintains a consistent and smooth texture indicative of skillful editing, retaining naturalness found in undisturbed snow after the skier passes through.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the details on the right-side skier's clothing, ski poles, and skis remain sharp and clear, without any blurring or loss of detail due to the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sharp and clear details of the skier’s gear in Image B suggest careful editing. Common knowledge regarding image detail preservation indicates that high-quality images retain details such as textures and markings on clothing and equipment, which is evident in the skiers’ clothing and gear displaying crisp details without noticeable blurring.",
