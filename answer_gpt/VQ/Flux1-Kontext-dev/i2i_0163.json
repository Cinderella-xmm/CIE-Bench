      "question": "Does the outdoor camping scene seamlessly integrate with the toasters, maintaining consistent lighting and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters are placed outdoors on a folding table, set in a park-like environment. The sunlight creates clear highlights and shadows consistent with the sunny outdoor setting. The lighting on the toasters and toast are aligned with the direction from which the sunlight appears to be coming (from the top right), creating a harmonious integration between the objects and their environment. Thus, the integration is visually coherent and consistent, reflecting an understanding of natural outdoor lighting conditions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the toasters placed naturally on the folding table without any visible distortion in the table's texture or structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters are shown on a folding table that appears stable and well-constructed. The table's texture and surface look consistent and undistorted, supporting the toasters well without any obvious imbalance or deformation in the surface or legs of the table. This suggests a natural placement of the toasters on the table, reflecting realistic physical interactions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the sunlight effects on the toast create realistic highlights and shadows on both the toast and surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunlight illuminates the toast, creating realistic highlights along the edges and top. Shadows are cast onto the toasters and table, which align with the outdoor lighting direction, adding depth and a realistic touch to the scene. This is consistent with how sunlight typically affects objects outdoors, demonstrating an understanding of light behavior in a natural environment.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the outdoor camping background and the foreground elements smooth, without any noticeable artifacts or missing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the background park setting and the foreground toasters is seamless, with no visible artifacts or rough edges around the objects. The background trees and grass blend naturally with the scene, maintaining visual coherence without disrupting the foreground elements, ensuring a unified composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the proportions and shapes of the toasters remained intact and physically plausible in the new outdoor camping scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters are presented with proportions and shapes consistent with the dimensions of typical toaster models. They retain their structure without distortion and fit naturally onto the table as expected in a physical outdoor setting. This demonstrates a plausible representation that respects real-world geometry and object sizes.",
