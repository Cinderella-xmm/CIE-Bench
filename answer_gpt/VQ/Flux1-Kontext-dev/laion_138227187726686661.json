      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the quilt display uniform square blocks with visible grid lines and a matte finish consistent with LEGO bricks, without any fabric-like folds or stitching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt features a pattern of square blocks that appear smooth and regular but they do not have the rigid, consistent structure typical of LEGO bricks. The motifs on the quilt have fabric characteristics such as stitching and folds, which suggest a textile material rather than a hard, uniform surface. LEGO bricks would not have lively patterns representing sports balls or stars; they would be more consistent in size and color. Therefore, the quilt's look is not consistent with LEGO bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the round sports elements (e.g., football, soccer ball) represented as circular LEGO tiles with consistent size and alignment within the square grid, without stretching or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sports elements, while circular, appear to be printed onto a quilt and resemble typical fabric motifs rather than flat, two-dimensional LEGO tiles. These elements show no evidence of consistent size or rigid alignment, and are instead proportionately incorporated into the design suggesting a textile rather than a LEGO assembly, which typically features very geometric and consistent shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the pillow replaced by a cube composed of stacked LEGO bricks with equal dimensions on all sides, right angles, and no visible gaps or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pillows maintain their rectangular shape and fabric appearance, and the bright and colorful structure resembling LEGO blocks is placed on the bed, however, the pillows are not replaced by a cube. The LEGO-like structure seen does not replace the pillows but seems to be an additional element placed on the bed. Thus, the description of a pillow replaced by a LEGO cube does not hold true.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bed base a flat, white, seamless surface with no visible wood grain, shadows, or depth cues, resembling a standard LEGO baseplate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bed base beneath the quilt is a flat, white surface with no visible wood grain or distinctive shadow patterns, which could suggest a more seamless look similar to that of a LEGO baseplate. Although it is difficult to completely ascertain the absence of all depth cues from a photograph alone, the description suits the appearance viewed in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire background a smooth, uniform white surface with no visible walls, furniture, or windows, and are there no shadows or lighting gradients indicating a physical space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is indeed a smooth, white surface with no visible signs of walls, furniture, ledges, windows, or any other elements that would suggest a physical space defined by objects or intricate shadows. It offers a minimalist look that aligns with this description of a uniform background.",
