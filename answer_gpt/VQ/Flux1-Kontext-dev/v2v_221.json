      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi cow retains the black-and-white coat patterns typical of a Holstein cow.

      "question": "Does the positioning of the cow leaning against the vintage television with its hooves on the screen look natural and structurally consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow is leaning against the television with its hooves placed on the screen, which appears to be a playful and deliberate pose. The positioning seems natural for a cartoonish style, with the hooves resting securely and showing no signs of improper balance or tension. Comparing to Image A where the cow stands beside the TV, the lean in Image B matches the whimsical nature of the edit, making the pose seem consistently designed for the chibi style.",

      "question": "Does the chibi cow's facial expression convey a mischievous grin naturally without appearing distorted or unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow's facial expression includes the raised ears and a subtle mouth shape that indicates a grin. The expression combines typical features of cartoonish designs, using exaggerated elements to convey emotion while maintaining anatomical correctness. There's no distortion or unnatural aspect to the grin; rather, it aligns with a playful and light-hearted aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the grassy field and bright sky with 3D clouds integrate seamlessly with the cow and TV, avoiding any obvious artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass, sky, and clouds create a consistent and unified background scene matching the cartoon environment style. The elements, such as grass blades and clouds, are uniformly rendered without visible seams or artifacts disrupting the aesthetic harmony. This integration appears cohesive, and when compared to Image A, the chibi style enhances rather than detracts from the overall seamless look.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B brings together the chibi cow, the vintage TV, and the bucolic scene, all portrayed in an imaginative manner that evokes a sense of whimsy. The cartoony style is consistent throughout, supporting the whimsical theme without any conflicting elements of realism that might undermine visual credibility. The playful ambience is successfully achieved by the cohesive illustration of all components.",
