      "question": "Do the zebras maintain their signature striped coats with no unnatural texture or loss of detail in the chibi-style 3D recreation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features zebra stripes that are clear and well-defined, maintaining the animals' natural pattern. Their texture appears smooth and consistent, indicating a successful recreation of the striped coats without distortion or loss of detail. This assessment is based on recognizing the typical appearance of zebra stripes and noting their presence and clarity in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the lush green field and fencing preserved in a photorealistic manner without any visible distortion or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green field and fence are visually consistent with photorealistic elements. The grass appears naturally green and unaltered, and the fence structure is intact without any visible distortions or artifacts. The coherence of the field and fencing suggests realistic preservation. This deduction comes from considering typical rural settings and comparing them to the edited image's visuals.",

      "question": "Do the zebras retain their realistic grazing stances without any distortion or deformation in the chibi-style 3D recreation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The zebras in Image B are depicted in natural grazing stances, similar to realistic positioning. Their limbs and body posture align with typical depictions of grazing animals in nature. This observation is based on world knowledge about zebra behavior and posture when grazing, indicating no distortion or deformation has been applied in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the ornate decorative photo frame integrate seamlessly with the scene without disrupting the visual coherence or introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the photo frame as a separate entity encasing the image without interfering with the interior scene of zebras and landscape. The frame's ornate design is consistent with typical art framing and does not introduce artifacts within the grassland or zebras' area, thereby preserving the visual coherence of the entire image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition between the chibi-style 3D zebras and the photorealistic background smooth and believable without any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The zebras in Image B, though recreated in 3D style, blend well with the photorealistic background without visible discrepancies or artifacts at the interface between zebras and grassland. This smooth transition suggests that both elements are harmoniously integrated, enhancing the scene's credibility. This assessment involves analyzing the consistency between varied styles and ensuring visual harmony between foreground and background.",
