      "question": "Are the floral and scroll motifs on the back of the dress clearly defined with smooth edges and no visible pixelation or broken lines after the paper-cut effect is applied?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the floral and scroll motifs on the back of the dress, which are visually enhanced by the paper-cut effect. Observing these motifs, their edges are smooth, and the lines are continuous without any visible pixelation or disruption. This indicates a high quality of editing where the paper-cut effect was applied meticulously, maintaining the integrity and definition of the motifs.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the blue gradient overlay on the dress transition smoothly without creating abrupt color boundaries or altering the underlying texture of the fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the blue gradient overlay on the dress appears to transition smoothly. Given world knowledge on gradient applications, abrupt color boundaries typically manifest as sharp lines or stark differences within color transitions. The overlay in the image maintains a seamless blend without such boundaries, preserving the fabric's texture underneath.",

      "question": "Is the silver tone of the hair accessory uniform and reflective in a way that matches the lighting direction and does not show unnatural highlights or dark patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silver tone of the hair accessory in the edited image is consistent with a uniform appearance. By evaluating the lighting, which seems to come from the top and left side, the reflection on the accessory aligns with this direction, without unnatural highlights or dark patches. This reflects realistic editing in photographic context.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bamboo patterns in the third postcard align correctly with the background bamboo stalks and maintain consistent spacing and perspective without overlapping or floating anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When examining the edited image, the bamboo patterns in the third postcard align well with the surrounding bamboo stalks in the background. The perspective is consistent, and there are no signs of overlapping or alignment issues that would suggest floating anomalies. This contributes to a cohesive visual representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the silk-bound book have a consistent material texture, proper thickness, and clean edges that match the appearance of a real physical object without stretching or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the silk-bound book displays a realistic material texture, maintaining proper thickness and clean edges similar to a tangible book. There are no signs of stretching or warping, which would render a visual inconsistency with the appearance of a physical book.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the three postcards positioned within the book layout with equal margins and no partial cropping or overlap that would disrupt the visual presentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image positions the postcards within the book layout such that margins appear balanced and there is no partial cropping or overlapping observable. The visual presentation flows well, with clean separation between elements, ensuring the layout is visually appealing.",
