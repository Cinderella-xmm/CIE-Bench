    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brass and copper textures on the headdress and face uniformly smooth and reflective, without visible noise, patchy areas, or abrupt transitions between adjacent segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headdress and sections of the sculpture exhibit a consistent texture, consistent with high-quality metal finishing. The reflectiveness is uniform across the surfaces with no visible inconsistency or abrupt transition, suggesting that the integration of mechanical components did not disturb the overall texture of the metal.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the vertical and horizontal stripes of the nemes headdress retain their original alignment and spacing, with no bending, stretching, or misalignment caused by the addition of mechanical parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes on the nemes headdress maintain a uniform alignment and consistent spacing. The addition of mechanical parts did not affect the original structure of the stripes, indicating precision in placing these additions without disturbing the existing pattern.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the mechanical wings symmetrically placed on either side of the head or shoulders, with clean edges, defined joints, and emerald accents that do not appear floating or disconnected from the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any mechanical wings; instead, it features vertical exhaust elements on both sides. These elements exhibit clear edges and defined joints that remain structurally coherent with the rest of the collar, with emerald accents well-integrated into the design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the clockwork designs on the collar clearly defined and evenly spaced, with steam exhaust pipes attached at plausible locations and angles, and no overlapping or clipping with surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clockwork designs, located on the collar, appear clearly defined and evenly spaced. The steam exhaust components are positioned logically, extending outward at coherent angles, ensuring there is no overlapping or clipping with other details in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the vapor emerging from the steam exhaust pipes translucent and softly diffused, with no sharp edges, pixelation, or unnatural clustering that suggests digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vapor issuing from the steam exhaust pipes is rendered with a soft, translucent quality. This effect is achieved without sharp edges, pixelation, or clustering, suggesting careful attention to realistic depiction of steam and avoidance of digital artifacting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the eyes, nose, and mouth proportionally aligned and anatomically correct, with no warping, elongation, or asymmetry caused by the integration of gears or other mechanical elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This question cannot be addressed due to the blurred face area in Image B, which conceals critical facial features like eyes, nose, and mouth, therefore preventing an accurate assessment of proportional alignment or anatomical correctness of these features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
