      "question": "Does the glass bottle form retain the original car’s side profile and curvature without visible warping or disproportionate scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the region of interest is the side profile and curvature of the car, which appears to remain consistent with its original shape. The edited image does not exhibit any visible warping or disproportionate scaling that would alter the vehicle's natural lines. The key features such as the front hood, doors, and curves seem to maintain their integrity. Hence, the edited image retains the proper side profile and curvature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the faceted glass stoppers aligned with the original headlight positions and do they show consistent lighting and reflection patterns with the surrounding glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there are headlight replacements with glass features that should be examined. These elements appear to not show a seamless alignment nor consistent lighting patterns, suggesting they were not handled precisely in the editing, remaining distinct from the original headlight positions.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gear-shaped lid positioned centrally on the roof and securely connected to the glass body without visible seams or floating edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable addition of a gear-shaped object on the roof of the car. It appears slightly off-central, and there are visible indicators such as shadows or outlines suggesting that it might not be securely connected to the glass body, indicating potential floating edges or imperfect blending.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the embossed Datsun emblem clearly visible on the front of the glass bottle and does it maintain proper depth and clarity without surface distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the location where the Datsun emblem would be situated, specifically on the front of the hood, features a different emblem entirely — a Mercedes logo — suggesting the original emblem is not visible. The new emblem, even if present, would be inconsistent with the embossed Datsun emblem's depth and clarity, leading to potential surface distortion.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the glass body display natural reflections and highlights across its surface without abrupt transitions or artificial sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B's surface quality, there are distinctive reflections indicative of a well-rendered glass-like reflective surface. The consistency and blending of reflections and highlights indicate that the glass body features natural reflections, avoiding any unnatural transitions or excessive sheen.",
