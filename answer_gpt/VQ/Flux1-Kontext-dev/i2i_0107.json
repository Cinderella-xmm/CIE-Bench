      "question": "Does the chibi version preserve distinct facial features like hair texture and glasses in a way that remains visually consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi version is a miniature representation, focusing on the essential features of the character, such as clothing and accessories, without too much detail in other areas. The hair texture appears simplified and more stylized compared to Image A. Glasses, which are not visible in the chibi version, are typically presented as smaller or absent in such representations to match the exaggerated and simplified chibi style. Based on this analysis, the chibi retains key elements but in a simplified form, lacking the finer texture details seen in the original.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scarf and the wand being held in the hand rendered with natural textures that match the other elements in the chibi figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarf and wand are rendered in a cartoonish style typical of chibi designs. The scarf follows the stylistic proportions of the exaggerated character, and while the textures are simplified, they are consistent with the overall style of the chibi figure. The wand is also rendered simply without intricate textures, suggesting that it complements the chibi aesthetic and matches the overall design of the figure. Therefore, these elements are consistent with the chibi figure's style, lacking realistic textures but maintaining visual coherence with the rest of the chibi.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand holding the wand proportionate with the rest of the chibi figure's body, and does it look anatomically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure's proportions are exaggerated as typical for chibi designs, where anatomy is not meant to reflect realistic human proportions. The hand holding the wand is oversized relative to a realistic human hand but fitting within the chibi aesthetic of overly large body parts for expressiveness and charm. The figure's overall anatomical plausibility aligns with the chibi style that lacks realistic proportions but is consistent with the exaggerated aesthetic.",

      "question": "Does the chibi character blend naturally into the wooden background without any visible artifacts or unnatural shadows that disrupt the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is positioned atop a wooden background with a clear separation between the figure and the background. The lighting and shadow effects are consistent, with no visible artifacts or unnatural shadows that would disrupt the scene. The chibi is cleanly integrated with the background, maintaining a natural interaction with its surroundings without any disruptive elements.",

      "question": "Are the scarf and tie designed with coherent shapes that do not introduce any broken or distorted geometries, preserving the chibi aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarf and tie maintain coherent shapes suitable for the chibi design aesthetic. They do not display broken or distorted geometries and fit well within the chibi proportions. The scarf and tie are simplified but consistent with the chibi character's exaggerated and stylized appearance, preserving the geometric shapes without disruption. Hence, these elements are designed to align with the unified chibi style.",
