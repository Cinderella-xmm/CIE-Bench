    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the individual bead segments aligned in a smooth, continuous curve that mimics the natural curvature of a serpent's body without abrupt angular breaks or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads are aligned in a smooth, continuous spiral, suggesting a design inspired by a serpent or other coiling object. Each bead seems to fit precisely with its neighbor, forming a coherent line without visible angular breaks or misalignment. This smooth alignment gives the appearance of a fluid, snake-like movement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blue circular elements positioned at the head end of the serpent in a symmetrical, forward-facing arrangement typical of animal eyes, and do they appear integrated into the surface rather than floating or disconnected?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are blue circular elements present on the beads; however, they are distributed uniformly along the entire length of the bead coil, rather than concentrated at what could be considered the head of a serpent. These elements do not form a forward-facing, symmetrical arrangement typical of eyes. They are, however, integrated into the surface of the beads.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the black tribal markings follow the natural flow of the serpent’s body segments and avoid sharp, unnatural edges or uniform repetition that suggests digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black markings on the beads are consistent and organic, following the curvature of each bead segment. There is variability in the patterning that avoids looking mechanical or artificially repetitive. The markings appear hand-painted or naturally formed, enhancing the overall fluid design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tail extend naturally from the rear of the serpent, tapering smoothly and ending in small, loosely connected bead-like tips that appear to hang or sway without breaking the continuity of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the serpent is represented as strings or cords with bead-like tips, extending naturally from the body. The tips appear to sway freely, adding a dynamic element to the design and enhancing the continuity of the structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the surface texture of the serpent’s body uniformly matte or slightly glossy like the original beads, without introducing areas of unnatural shine, roughness, or inconsistent material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface texture of the beads is uniformly smooth and slightly glossy, consistent with a ceramic or polished surface. There are no sections that show unnatural shine or uneven texture that would disrupt the uniformity of the design.",
