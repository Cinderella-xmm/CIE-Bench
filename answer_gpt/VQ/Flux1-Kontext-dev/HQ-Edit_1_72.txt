    "Question": "Q1: Are the gold embellishments on the Dashiki naturally integrated into the fabric, showing realistic reflective properties and no floating or pixelated edges?",
    "explanation": "The gold embellishments on the Dashiki are analyzed by observing the texture, integration into the fabric, and their interaction with light, which involves checking for realistic reflective properties and examining for any visual inconsistencies such as pixelation or floating appearance. The embellishments appear smoothly integrated and reflect light naturally without any visible digital artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the beads and symbols on the shoulders align correctly with the shoulder anatomy and exhibit natural material textures without distortion or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "The beads and symbols are inspected for accurate alignment with the underlying shoulder structure, as well as for the texture consistency that would indicate physical realism. The beads are well placed and follow the natural shoulder contour without distortion, maintaining a realistic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the Acacia trees in the background proportionally accurate and structurally coherent, with natural branching patterns and no visible geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "The Acacia trees are evaluated for realism based on their size, branching patterns, and structural coherence. These elements are consistent with what is expected of natural Acacia trees, showing no signs of geometric distortion or unusual proportionality, confirming their realistic depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the wild grass in the foreground and midground display natural variation in height, color, and orientation, avoiding repetitive or tiled patterns?",
    "explanation": "The grass is assessed for natural variability, looking for differences in height, color, and orientation to ensure realism. There is visible variation in these aspects, displaying randomness typical of natural grass, and no detection of repetitive or artificially tiled patterns.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the hands show five fingers each, with natural joint alignment, skin texture, and shading that matches the rest of the figure?",
    "explanation": "The hands must be checked for anatomical accuracy, ensuring each hand has five fingers with joints properly aligned and skin texture harmonizing with the overall depiction of the figure. The hands present appropriate finger count, alignment, and texture consistent with the rest of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
