    "Question": "Q1: Does the golden butterfly appear naturally lit and integrated into the scene without disrupting the existing light sources?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the golden butterfly is brightly colored and prominently displayed on the mirror. The existing light source around the mirror provides a soft, warm glow. The butterfly doesn't cast shadows onto the surrounding surfaces, suggesting it is not interacting with the light in a realistic manner. This indicates that the butterfly does not appear naturally lit or integrated into the scene.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the material and texture of the golden butterfly consistent with the surrounding surfaces, avoiding any visible unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the golden butterfly on the mirror appears very vivid and smooth without any visible texture similar to the surrounding materials like the matte tiles or reflective surfaces. Its starkly different texture suggests it is an overlay or digital addition, making it inconsistent with the current surrounding surfaces.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the shape of the golden butterfly structurally coherent and free from distortion, maintaining proper geometry as it appears above the mirror?",
    "explanation": "Observing the butterfly in Image B, the wings are symmetrically shaped with clear and distinct patterns, maintaining realistic proportions and geometry. There are no visible distortions affecting its overall structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the position of the golden butterfly above the mirror contribute positively to the overall composition without creating visual discontinuity?",
    "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B is centered prominently on the mirror, which can draw focus as a primary element. However, because it does not have consistent lighting and texture with the rest of the image, it creates a visual discontinuity, as it sits atop the mirror's reflective surface instead of appearing as a reflection or part of the surrounding environment.",
    "answer": "No"
}

```json
{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the fine details of the golden butterfly been preserved, ensuring clarity and sharpness in comparison to the rest of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's patterns and edges are sharp and clear, showing defined lines and colors, which align with the clarity and sharpness seen in the rest of the image. The fine details have been preserved to maintain consistency with the image's resolution.",
    "answer": "Yes"
