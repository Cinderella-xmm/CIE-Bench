      "question": "Does the leather texture across the backpack's main body appear uniformly consistent in grain, color, and thickness without unnatural seams or patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack's leather texture appears evenly consistent in grain and color across the main body. There are no visible seams or patches that deviate from this texture. The design presents a smooth and homogeneous appearance with the same texture throughout, suggesting an attention to detail for a uniformly finished product.",

      "question": "Are the buckle surfaces altered to display a brass-like finish with subtle tarnishing and realistic light reflection, without deformed shapes or mismatched highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buckles exhibit a brass-like appearance, characterized by a gold-tone finish with subtle tarnishing. The light reflection on the buckles appears realistic and consistent with the metal texture. They maintain their original shape and do not show any deformation or mismatched highlights, signifying accurate rendering of metallic properties.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no travel patches visible on the side pockets adjacent to the stitching. Consequently, there are no alignment issues, warping, or floating appearances along the contours or stitching of the pockets detected in the edited image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The compass graphic in Image B is located near the base of the backpack and is depicted with fine, consistent lines that form a circular pattern. The lines are clear, and the graphic does not distort the surrounding leather texture, indicating a precise and delicate rendering within the image.",
