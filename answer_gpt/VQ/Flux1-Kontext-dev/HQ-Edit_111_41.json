      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the seat cushion's surfaces composed of clearly defined, uniformly sized LEGO brick layers with smooth gradients between them, maintaining a consistent black color without texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seat cushion appears to be composed of smooth, black material typical of modern office chairs and not of LEGO brick layers. The surface does not exhibit the typical characteristics of LEGO bricks, such as distinct edges or pegs, nor does it appear to consist of multiple layers or gradients. Instead, it maintains a smooth, uniform appearance associated with traditional upholstery, indicating that the seat is not constructed from LEGO bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the backrest consist of evenly spaced, horizontally aligned LEGO brick layers that follow the original contour without gaps, misalignments, or irregular spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backrest is made of leather or a similar smooth material, with horizontal strips that give a segmented appearance but do not resemble LEGO brick layers. The strips are evenly spaced and aligned, which is typical for office chairs designed for ergonomic support. There are no visual cues to suggest that the backrest is composed of LEGO bricks, as it lacks the defining features such as pegs and interlocking design of LEGO bricks.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the armrests rendered as simple hinged LEGO pieces with clean edges and uniform silver finish, preserving their original curvature and connection points without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armrests appear to be constructed from a smooth, metallic material, with a simple curved design that does not exhibit the distinct characteristics of LEGO pieces, such as interlocking mechanisms or hinges. The finish is uniform silver, and the overall shape maintains the chair's original design, suggesting that the armrests are not made of LEGO components.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all five wheels made of translucent gray material with visible internal structure resembling LEGO wheel design, and do they maintain consistent size and placement under the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels of the chair are typical office chair casters, solid in appearance and not translucent. They do not possess any visible internal structures or design elements that resemble LEGO wheels, which typically feature internal mechanisms for interlocking with other LEGO pieces. The wheels are consistently sized and placed under the base, but they do not exhibit the defined characteristics of LEGO design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the chair positioned on a flat, uninterrupted white tabletop surface that contrasts with the original floor, with no visible shadows or depth inconsistencies suggesting misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair is indeed placed on a flat white surface, likely intended to be a tabletop. The background is a plain white color providing a clear contrast to the black chair, typical of studio product photography to emphasize the product itself. There are no visible shadows or depth inconsistencies that suggest the chair is misaligned or improperly placed on an uneven surface.",
