      "question": "Does the holographic projection screen emerge naturally from the phone without disrupting the visual flow of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic projection appears to emerge smoothly from the phone. The design of the projection is visually aligned with the device, creating a seamless transition indicative of a convincing interface in a digital context. This suggests that the projection is integrated well into the image without visual disruption. The smooth flow from the phone to the projection supports this as a natural extension.",

      "question": "Are there any noticeable artifacts or unnatural colors where the holographic screen connects with the phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the colors and design where the holographic screen connects to the phone appear consistent and without noticeable artifacts. The blending is quite seamless; the digital blue hues follow naturally into the device, which indicates a deliberate and careful integration. The absence of contrasting or unnatural colors at the intersection implies a clean editing process.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the dimensions of the holographic projection screen match the scale of the surrounding objects in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dimensions of the holographic screen seem proportionate relative to the surrounding objects. The screen extends from the phone in a natural, proportionate manner, which does not overpower or appear diminutive compared to the body and the phone. This scale consistency helps maintain the visual balance and suggests that the dimensions match well with the rest of the image's elements.",

      "question": "Has the overall texture and detail of the sandwich been preserved despite the addition of the holographic screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This question seems to relate more to Image A, where the sandwich is present, whereas the holographic screen addition in Image B does not involve a sandwich. Since Image B does not contain a sandwich, it is correct to conclude that the sandwich's detail and texture have not been discussed or altered in relation to the holographic projection.",

      "question": "Does the background remain consistent and undistorted by the addition of the holographic projection screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B, where the holographic projection is edited, appears consistent and maintains integrity without any noted distortion from the addition. The darker setting augments the holographic elements while staying true to the digital theme, ensuring the background remains unaffected by the introduction of the digital screen.",
