      "question": "Do the 3D printed display model and display plaque appear naturally integrated into the image, without disrupting the sceneâ€™s overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D printed display model is well-integrated into the scene. The lighting on the model matches that of the environment, contributing to a natural look. The shadows and reflections are consistent with the light source, supporting the overall authenticity. No noticeable editing artifacts disrupt the scene's authenticity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the texture of the 3D printed model resemble matte PLA plastic realistically, without showing any unnatural surface irregularities or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model's vase and flowers exhibit a consistent matte texture that one would expect from a 3D printed object using PLA plastic. The surface appears smooth, and there are no visible artifacts or irregularities that would suggest an unnatural finish. The material convincingly matches the expected texture of 3D printed PLA plastic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the display plaque at the base positioned correctly, maintaining structural consistency and contributing to the visual credibility of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display plaque is positioned squarely beneath the vase, appearing structurally sound and coherent with the model's base. The alignment and perspective are correct, and it contributes to the image's visual credibility, as no distortions are apparent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Does the transition between the original elements and the new tech expo booth background appear seamless, avoiding any obvious artifacts or unnatural segmentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition between the model and the tech expo booth background is seamless. The background is blurred correctly according to depth of field principles, with no obvious segmentation or artifacts that would indicate poor editing. This suggests a coherent integration into the background.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the 3D printed model and the display plaque realistic and consistent with what one would expect in a real-world scenario, avoiding any noticeable distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions of the model and the display plaque appear realistic; the size of the vase and flowers in relation to the display plaque and surrounding environment is consistent with what is expected in reality. There are no noticeable distortions or disproportionate elements.",
