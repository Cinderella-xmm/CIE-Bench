      "question": "Are the stripes on the zebra sharp and distinct without any unnatural pixelation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are clearly defined and there is no evidence of pixelation or blurring. The clarity of the stripes indicates a high-quality image where the details of the zebra's markings are well preserved. This impression is confirmed by the absence of jagged edges or blurry transitions between the black and white areas of the stripes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the zebra's fur textures appear natural without any visible artificial streaks or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, the zebra's fur looks natural and consistent with the typical appearance of a zebra in the wild, without any artificial enhancements or distortions. The fur texture is detailed enough to convey a sense of realism, with no signs of artificial streaks or added patterns that would indicate digital manipulation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the zebra's body consistent and free from any geometric distortions like warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions of the zebra's body in Image B appear natural, reflecting the expected anatomy of a zebra. The limbs, body size, and head all align with common knowledge of zebra proportions. There are no signs of warping or stretching that might suggest digital distortion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the relative position between the zebra and the background grassland remain unchanged and natural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra stands naturally against the grassland background. There is a consistent perspective between the zebra and the field, indicating that the zebra wasn't moved or the background altered in relation to it. This natural alignment suggests no change from its original depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the grass blades and the zebra's hooves detailed and free from any loss of sharpness or introduction of noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the grass blades and the zebra's hooves are clearly defined and maintain sharpness. The details are sufficient to discern individual grass blades and the contours of the hooves without noticeable noise or loss of detail that would suggest degradation of image quality.",
