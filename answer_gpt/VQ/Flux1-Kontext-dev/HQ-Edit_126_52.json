      "question": "Are the crystal shards aligned with the cactus ribs and uniformly distributed without gaps or overlapping clusters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus is adorned with crystal shards protruding from its surface. By analyzing their arrangement, it is clear that the crystals are consistently positioned at the tops of the cactus ribs, suggesting an understanding of symmetry and design. The crystals are not clustered erratically nor do they overlap, indicating that they are placed with uniformity and intentional spacing. This leads to the conclusion that the shards are indeed aligned with the cactus ribs and distributed evenly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the luminous glyphs follow the rib lines of the cactus and emit a soft glow without causing overexposure or halo effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus contains luminous glyphs or symbols that are inset within the ribs. The visual appearance suggests these glyphs do not create overwhelming brightness that would otherwise obscure the surface details or cause halo effects around them. The consistent and controlled illumination indicates the luminescence is soft and subdued. Such a depiction aligns with the awareness that delicate illumination should complement rather than overshadow the cactus's natural texture.",

      "question": "Is the sandstone pedestal fully grounded on the wooden surface with natural texture and no floating or clipped edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus pot is set on a rugged, natural terrain rather than a wooden surface, contrasting with the setup in Image A. While Image B lacks a wooden texture, the pot appears solidly placed on the ground, indicating gravitational propriety without visual discrepancies such as floating or clipped edges. The cactus and its pot exhibit stability within their contextual environment.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the amber eyes embedded within the cactus ribs at symmetrical positions and do they show internal illumination without distorting the surrounding tissue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases amber-like features affixed onto the cactus. These are symmetrically placed along the ribs, contributing to a balanced appearance. They exhibit a glowing quality that enhances, rather than disrupts, the cactus's structural form, which suggests an awareness of material compatibility. The illumination does not warp or compromise the cactus's surface integrity, thus affirming their design accomplishment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the vine tendrils curve naturally around the pedestal and connect smoothly to the base without floating or rigid positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, vine tendrils are evident around the base of the cactus pot. They exhibit a naturalistic curve and rest organically upon the pedestal. The tendrilsâ€™ movement and shapes emulate real plant behavior, indicative of an understanding of organic growth patterns. The vines connect seamlessly to the pot's base, confirming a smooth, grounded positioning without signs of unnatural rigidity or suspension.",
