      "question": "Does the tall glass on the right display consistent pixelated and circuit-like textures across its surface without visible cracks, jagged edges, or inconsistent rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall glass exhibits a distinct blue hue with circuit-like patterns that appear evenly distributed across its surface. The patterns maintain uniformity and don't present any visible cracks or jagged edges. The texture and rendering are consistent with the futuristic, digital theme applied throughout the image, avoiding any inconsistencies or visible distortions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the outlines of the Sydney Opera House composed of continuous, evenly spaced neon lines that maintain the correct number and shape of the shell structures without misalignment or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines of the Sydney Opera House are depicted using neon lines. These lines are continuous and evenly spaced, accurately tracing the iconic shell structures of the opera house. The shape and number of the shells are preserved, ensuring there are no misalignment or missing sections, which is consistent with a correctly rendered architectural neon effect.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wave patterns in the water consist of uniform, repeating geometric shapes that align horizontally and vertically without overlapping irregularly or creating gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wave patterns in the water are transformed into a series of geometric shapes that appear to be electronically inspired. These shapes repeat uniformly, maintaining horizontal and vertical alignment across the water surface. There are no irregular overlaps or gaps observed, which aligns with a coherent geometric pattern.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the beverage in the shorter glass show a consistent holographic effect with subtle layering and refraction, without distorting the shape of the ice cubes or causing unnatural transparency gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beverage in the shorter glass presents a digital holographic look with glowing accents. The ice cubes inside retain their shape without distortions. The layering and refraction effects are subtle and align with the overall futuristic design of the image, without introducing unnatural transparency gradients.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the two glasses aligned with the direction of the sunset lighting, and do they match the apparent position of the sun in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting has been edited to convey a digital theme, with the surroundings reflecting a neon ambiance rather than an actual sunset scenario. The shadows in the digital theme do not realistically align with a natural sunset lighting direction and do not match the direction or position of the sun depicted, as such neon effects don't align with natural light physics.",
