      "question": "Does the chibi character maintain proper structural consistency, with the head being slightly oversized yet naturally proportioned to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is represented with a horse's body for a head, which is conceptually unusual and defies typical chibi proportions where the head is generally oversized yet proportionate in a cartoonish style. The horse body as a head does not align with the expected proportions of a chibi character, resulting in structural inconsistency.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
