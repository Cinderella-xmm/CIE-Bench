      "question": "Does the crack on the Axe container appear natural and maintain the structural integrity of the container without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a container of Axe Putty with a portion visually altered to suggest a crack with energy bursting out. The crack is stylized and does not appear natural as it disrupts the symmetrical, rounded design of the container and introduces jagged edges and an energy burst effect which are not typical of a real-world crack maintaining structural integrity. Common knowledge of containers suggests cracks often lead to structural weakness rather than energetic bursts, so the altered crack does not appear natural.",

      "question": "Does the miniature nebula inside the container blend naturally with the interior of the container and maintain visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited depiction of a nebula with cosmic elements such as glowing stars and energy inside the container is an artistic representation and does not conform to real-world expectations of what should be inside a product container. Nebulas are large celestial phenomena and their inclusion inside a small container does not blend naturally with the interior, as the interior is supposed to have a homogeneous product. Real-world knowledge tells us product containers are meant to store product contents, not celestial phenomena.",

      "question": "Are the cosmic dust and gases within the nebula detailed and textured, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cosmic dust and gases in the altered nebula appear detailed and are visually well-rendered with smooth transitions of colors and glowing effects. The depiction lacks obvious pixelation and maintains a high level of detail, similar to polished digital artwork or images of space phenomena that visually portray cosmic textures without noticeable artifacts.",

      "question": "Does the size and shape of the nebula fit naturally within the container's opening, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nebula depicted inside the container is much larger and extends visually beyond the boundaries you would expect from the container's opening, suggesting an explosive effect rather than a natural fit. Common sense tells us that object contents usually stay within their physical boundaries unless manipulated, thus the explosive form of the nebula does not naturally fit the container's opening, impacting structural consistency and credibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fiery red and energetic pink hues in the nebula consistent with the label design and contribute to the overall natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label design in Image B uses rich red and pink hues which align with the colors found in the edited nebula. This chromatic harmony offers visual coherence between the label and the nebula emanating from the container, ensuring the colors fit within the containerâ€™s design theme. While these hues are consistent, this consistency contributes to artistic appeal rather than a natural appearance due to the impossible nature of the nebula.",
