      "question": "Does the marble texture beneath the teapot exhibit natural veining and color variation without abrupt edges or artificial patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the marble texture on the box has a natural flowing pattern of veining, typically found in real marble, and does not show signs of abrupt or artificial edges. The faint gray lines mimic the random paths that naturally occur in marble, indicative of quality design. The pattern and texture appear widely distributed and subtle, expected of marble designs. Thus, based on common knowledge of marble's appearance, the texture seems authentic and natural.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the transparent label positioned on the teapotâ€™s body with uniform opacity and no visible pixelation or ghosting around the text edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no transparent label evident on the teapot. The teapot appears as a smooth porcelain model with consistent detailing and no overlayed labels. Given the high-resolution and clarity of the image, any label should be apparent. Since no label is visible, this suggests that either a label was not intended to be there or it blends seamlessly into the background, which is improbable, leading to the conclusion that the assumption of a label's presence is incorrect.",

      "question": "Does the gold monogram on the lid align with the surrounding engravings in terms of depth, shadow, and metallic finish, without appearing raised or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a gold monogram on the teapot lid; the lid maintains a uniform porcelain appearance with consistent engraving patterns around it. There is a notable absence of a metallic sheen or shadow variance that a gold monogram would create. If a monogram were on the lid, it would likely be designed to blend with the teapot's other embellishments, ensuring uniform depth and texture, which is not observed in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the box positioned adjacent to the teapot with correct perspective and scale, and does it feature consistent engraving patterns and material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box is positioned next to the teapot, showcasing a compatible perspective and scale relative to the teapot. The patterns on the box are in harmony with the teapot's detailing, displaying similar ornamental engravings. Their material appearance is consistent, suggesting that they belong to the same product line. The lighting matches between the box and the teapot, supporting a seamless blend within the scene. These aspects ensure that the two objects are rendered in correct perspective and alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the teapot and box consistent with the light source direction and do they match the ambient lighting of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows observed in Image B, both from the teapot and the box, are consistent with the apparent light source direction, which seems to be coming from the upper left side of the scene. The soft shadowing mirrors realistic ambient lighting, aligning well with the light and shadow contrast expected in such a setup. These shadows also align with the high-end product style and carefully arranged presentation, confirming coherence between light source, object position, and shadow placement.",
