    "Question": "Q1: Do the skeletal wing-like extensions emerge naturally from the rock arch's edges without gaps, floating sections, or unnatural angles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skeletal wing-like extensions appear to originate from the rock arch’s edges. Upon close analysis, the extensions seem to float and do not seamlessly blend with the rock formation. There are noticeable gaps and the angles at which extensions meet the rock surface may seem unnatural due to their digitally inserted nature. Thus, the extensions do not naturally emerge as they might in a naturally formed structure.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the crystalline growths along the arch’s curve textured and colored to blend with the surrounding rock, avoiding excessive gloss or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, any crystalline growths or similar elements such as the glowing creature do not attempt to blend in with the rock as natural crystals might. Instead, the addition appears more stylized and distinct with a mystical blue glow, which contrasts sharply with the earthy tones of the rock. The highlights from the glow are strong and create a clear distinction rather than a natural blend.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the glowing veins across the surface follow natural mineral-like patterns and have soft, continuous light emission without jagged edges or blocky artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The glowing veins on the creature seen in Image B are reminiscent of energy patterns rather than natural mineral veins. These tend to emit light smoothly and continuously, without visible jagged edges or blocky artifacts. The design is more magical and smooth in appearance, adhering to a more stylistic than naturalistic depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the runic symbols on the inner surface of the arch carved into the rock with consistent depth and shadow, matching the texture of natural erosion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, no runic symbols appear directly on the rock surface of the arch. The glowing entity itself carries any detailing like symbols or patterns. Therefore, there are no runic symbols observed that are carved into the rock, hence making a direct comparison for depth and shadow consistency unnecessary.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the radiant orb emit light that matches the ambient lighting direction and creates realistic soft shadows and reflections on adjacent rock surfaces?",
    "explanation": "The radiant orb in Image B appears to emit light, though its effect on the surroundings is limited. The light from the orb does not seamlessly merge with the ambient lighting to create realistic soft shadows or reflections on the adjacent rock surfaces. This suggests that the emission is stylized and isolated, maintaining the magical appearance rather than integrating naturally with environmental light.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the ground textures, cracks, and soil near the base of the arch preserved and not obscured or distorted by the added elements?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the creature's presence doesn’t obscure the ground textures, cracks, and soil near the base of the arch. The overall realism of the ground surface remains consistent, and visible features like cracks and soil texture are preserved as seen in the original image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
