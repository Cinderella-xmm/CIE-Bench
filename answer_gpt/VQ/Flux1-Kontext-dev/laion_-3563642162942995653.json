    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the crystal facets on the truck's cabin and body uniformly shaped and aligned with the original panel lines, without visible breaks or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a crystal truck with facets that appear to be smoothly aligned with the original panel lines of the truck's cabin and body. There are no visible breaks or misaligned edges, suggesting that the crystal facets are uniformly shaped and maintain the truck's design integrity. By observing the clean and orderly appearance of these lines, it is reasonable to conclude that they are consistent with the original structure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the transparent quartz wheels maintain the same size, spacing, and axle alignment as the original muddy wheels, with no floating or misplaced components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the image, the quartz wheels of the crystal truck appear to have the same size and shape as the original muddy wheels. The spacing between the wheels and their alignment on the axle seems consistent with the original design. There are no signs of floating or misplaced components, suggesting that the dimensions and positioning are accurately maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the quartz wheels internally detailed with natural-looking crystal lattice structures that follow the shape of the original hubs and rims, without jagged or inconsistent lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the quartz wheels in the image, they seem to lack detailed internal crystal lattice structures that mimic the shape of the original hubs and rims. Instead, they appear smooth and uniform without intricate detailing inside, which implies that they do not exhibit the natural-looking crystal lattice structures as described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white marble platform flat, continuous, and properly supporting the entire underside of the crystal truck, with no visible gaps or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts the truck resting on a white marble platform, which visually appears flat and continuous. There are no visible gaps or floating sections, and the truck's underside is entirely supported by the marble platform, showing proper alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the crystal surfaces display subtle color refraction and reflections consistent with emerald and jade materials, without unnatural glowing patches or excessive chromatic aberration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal surfaces in the image reflect light subtly and uniformly, giving off a green hue consistent with emerald or jade materials. There is no evidence of unnatural glowing patches or excessive chromatic aberration, which indicates that the reflections and refractions appear natural and typical for these materials.",
