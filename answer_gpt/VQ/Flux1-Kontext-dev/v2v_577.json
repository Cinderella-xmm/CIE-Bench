      "question": "Does the LEGO-style minifigure maintain the subject's calm and professional demeanor without any unnatural distortions in its facial features or posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO-style minifigure is depicted sitting with a laptop on a desk, reflecting a calm and professional demeanor. The minifigure's posture is upright, similar to the position a person would take when seriously engaged in work. Given the LEGO-style, which often simplifies facial features and expressions, it still successfully maintains the subject's original demeanor as outlined in the theme, without any unnatural distortions in posture or expression. The minifigure is consistent with typical LEGO representation, which prioritizes simplicity and recognizability.",

      "question": "Are the textures and details of the LEGO-style cat consistent with the LEGO theme and free from unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is designed in a LEGO style, characterized by smooth and minimalistic features that align with the typical look of LEGO figures. The curves and shapes are simple, with distinguishing features like the pointed ears and round eyes, which are typical of LEGO figures. There are no unusual textures or artifacts that deviate from the expected LEGO aesthetic. The cat's appearance is consistent with the playful and iconic LEGO style.",

      "question": "Does the transparent glass cube maintain structural consistency and visual credibility, without any broken geometric shapes or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent glass cube encasing the scene is clear and neatly rendered. Its edges and corners are straight and sharp as expected from a glass cube, with no signs of warping, bending, or broken geometric shapes. The light interaction with the glass, such as reflections or refractions, does not introduce any inconsistencies. As a result, the glass cube maintains visual credibility and adheres to expected geometric consistency.",

      "question": "Do the compact desk and laptop retain their proportions and physical rationality, avoiding any distortion or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the compact desk and laptop are modeled in a LEGO style with an emphasis on block-like simplicity. Despite the simplification, the proportions of both elements respect their real-world counterparts. The desk supports the laptop properly, and the laptop's closed state is appropriately represented without any distortion or exaggerated shapes. The structure maintains logical proportions and remains consistent with real-world physical characteristics while still fitting within the LEGO theme.",

      "question": "Does the lighting and gradient background enhance the color scheme and maintain overall authenticity, without introducing any unnatural artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is soft and natural, which complements the LEGO-style design, enhancing the overall appearance of the objects without overshadowing them or creating harsh contrasts. The gradient background smoothly transitions, providing depth without distracting from the main subject. No unnatural artifacts or inconsistencies appear in the lighting or background that would suggest a loss of authenticity. The overall impression is cohesive and visually harmonious.",
