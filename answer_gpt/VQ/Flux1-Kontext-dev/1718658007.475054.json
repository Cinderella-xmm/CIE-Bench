    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the pastel colors applied to the octopus uniformly distributed without abrupt color shifts or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus is depicted with a smooth and even coloration, characteristic of a pastel color palette that is typically soft and has subtle transitions. The edges appear clean without pixelation, suggesting a well-executed and uniform distribution of color.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the brush outlines around the octopus follow the natural curves of its body and tentacles without overlapping or breaking at joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The octopus in Image B is illustrated with outlines that seamlessly trace the contours of its body and tentacles. The lines hug the natural curves without any visible overlaps or breaks, indicating careful attention to the fluid shape of the octopus.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waves near the shore smooth and consistent in shape, showing natural foam patterns without jagged or broken textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waves are depicted with a smooth, flowing consistency along the shore and exhibit typical foam patterns found in cartoon illustrations. The shapes are rounded and fluid, avoiding jagged or broken textures, indicating a coherent artistic style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text positioned above the horizon line without intersecting clouds or causing visible distortion in the background sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is strategically placed above the horizon line, ensuring clear visibility without intersecting with any clouds. This placement maintains the integrity of the text and prevents any distortion or awkward overlap with the sky, allowing for a clean and unobstructed view.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the octopus and surrounding terrain align with the direction of the sunset light source and maintain depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not emphasize realistic shadow detailing; it focuses on a more cartoonish and simplified style, which often omits complex lighting and shadow interactions. Instead, it uses flat colors without highlighting the directionality associated with shadows cast by a sunset. Therefore, the analysis of shadows and alignment with the light source is not applicable in this context.",
