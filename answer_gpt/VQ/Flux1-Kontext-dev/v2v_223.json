      "question": "Does the lacework on the dress retain its intricate details without appearing distorted or overly simplified in the 3D cartoon style?",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lacework on the dress is part of a 3D cartoon style representation.
