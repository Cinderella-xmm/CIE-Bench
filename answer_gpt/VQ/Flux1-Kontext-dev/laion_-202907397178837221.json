      "question": "Do the pixel-patterned facades on the skyscrapers align precisely with the original building outlines, showing no distorted edges or misaligned blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers feature pixel-patterned facades resembling digital aesthetics, typically presented in clean and precise geometric shapes. Observing the skyline, the facades are uniformly applied, following the building outlines without apparent distortions or misalignment of blocks. Thus, visually, everything seems to maintain the integrity of the original buildings' shapes without disruptions. Comparing these observations with Image A, the skyscrapers are clearly defined without any irregularities, supporting the conclusion that the pixel-patterns are correctly aligned.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the angular digital circuits forming the trees connected logically from base to tip, with no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, trees are depicted with angular digital circuits, reflecting an electronic style. The circuits appear connected uniformly from the base to the tip, with continuous lines creating the whole structure without visible gaps or floating segments. This logical connectivity ensures the digital depiction remains coherent. Comparing with Image A, which portrays typical lush trees, the design choice maintains connectivity too, reinforcing the accurate representation.",

      "question": "Do the neon lights along the bridge run continuously along the rail tracks and side panels without gaps or incorrect bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B suggests neon light enhancements along the bridge. Observing the bridge, the neon lights seem to follow the rail tracks and side panels in a continuous manner, enhancing without interruptions or odd bends that could disrupt the visual flow. In contrast, Image A displays a straightforward wooden bridge. The comparison clarifies the neon lights adhere accurately to the bridge structure.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all skyscrapers in the skyline uniformly converted to pixel-patterned luminous towers, with no partial or missing conversions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyline's skyscrapers are uniformly converted to pixel-patterned luminous towers, featuring a consistent digital aesthetic. There is no noticeable omission or partial conversion among the towers. Compared to Image A, where the skyline presents standard building surfaces, the conversion in Image B appears complete and cohesive, with every building participating in the design theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the window grids on the buildings, the individual beams of the bridge, and the foliage of non-digital trees still clearly visible and undistorted after editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital editing approach modifies textures and elements to fit a luminous and pixelated theme. The window grids appear subtly integrated within the pixel-patterns. Bridge beams maintain structural presence, although visually altered by neon designs, and non-digital trees do not seem prominent, as the enhancement focuses on digital aesthetics. Image A, with all elements clearly depicted, provides more visibility to grids, beams, and foliage. Consequently, due to digital shifts, some natural clarity and detail are lost post-editing.",
