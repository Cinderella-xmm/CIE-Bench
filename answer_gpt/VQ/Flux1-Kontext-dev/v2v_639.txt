    "Question": "Q1: Are the LEGO minifigures of the person and giraffe free from unnatural textures and maintain their structural coherence?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO minifigures are designed to emulate the look of a toy or miniature model. These figures are expected to have a smooth, plasticky surface typical of LEGO bricks. Based on the visual cues, both figures appear consistent with typical LEGO aesthetics, without any unusual textures that would deviate from their expected material. Their structure and form seem coherent, maintaining the recognizable blocky and simplified design associated with LEGO figures.",
