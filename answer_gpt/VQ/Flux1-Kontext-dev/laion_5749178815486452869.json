      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the green field appear to float above the starry background with clean, continuous edges and no visible distortions or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green field is part of a floating island, distinct from the starry background. The edges of the island are clean and continuous, with a clear separation and consistency in geometry, which supports the idea of floatation. The perspective and positioning create an effective illusion of the field floating above the background without distortions or broken geometry.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the yellow and red flowers vividly colored but free from unnatural texture artifacts or color fringing around their petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers on the floating island are brightly colored with smooth textures. They have defined shapes, and the petals appear clear without color fringing or texture artifacts, maintaining a vivid and natural appearance. The artistic style emphasizes clarity and smoothness in detailing the flowers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the apple-shaped object in the sky significantly larger than the tree and properly lit with consistent shading and texture, resembling a real fruit rather than a flat graphic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple atop the structure is a large, well-rendered object with shading and texture that mimics the real appearance of a fruit. The lighting captures the curvature and gloss of the apple, distinguishing it from a flat shape, and it is notably larger than the tree, providing a surrealistic yet realistic representation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the insect figures (bee and butterfly) stylized but still identifiable, with smooth contours and no anatomical deformities or fragmented parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, insects like ants and a bug are featured. These creatures are depicted with clear stylized details that allow easy identification. The contours are smooth, and the figures have well-defined shapes without any anatomical deformities or fragmentation, contributing to the surreal yet coherent theme of the artwork.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the tree replaced by a hollow, angular geometric form with clean lines and internal voids, matching the surreal style without appearing fragmented or physically impossible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary structure beneath the apple presents a hollow, angular form resembling a building, probably representing an artistic element that integrates well with the surreal theme. The structure has clean lines and internal voids that reinforce the surreal style without fragmentation or improbability, maintaining a coherent portrayal within the scene.",
