      "question": "Are the proportions of both characters consistent and free from distortion in their respective views within the combined illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters appear in various interactions across different panels, maintaining consistency in proportions. The height, body structure, and positioning relative to each other and the furniture are visually harmonious, with no visible distortions or inconsistent proportions. Given the consistent scaling and dimensions seen in both the male and female characters, their proportions appear consistent and free from distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the textures of the office elements such as chairs, plants, and desks appear natural and retain fine details without obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a workplace setting with chairs, desks, and plants, all appearing well-defined and natural. The textures of these elements, like the sleek surface of the chairs, the realistic rendering of the plant leaves, and the simple yet realistic desk design, appear devoid of any pixelation or artifacts that would impede the quality. This suggests that the textures retain fine detail and appear natural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the computer screens realistic with sharp images, and does the interaction between the characters and screens appear natural without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the computer screens display images that are clearly discernible with proper outlines, contributing to realism. The characters’ hand positions and eye directions imply natural interaction with the screens, avoiding artifacts like misalignment or overlay issues. As such, the screens appear realistic with sharp images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the characters align correctly with their environment, maintaining a plausible spatial relationship and avoiding any broken geometric shapes or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial arrangement between the characters and their office environment shows consistent geometrical relationships. Elements such as the desk and chairs maintain proportionality and spatial alignment, and the characters are correctly positioned in relation to these elements. There is no evident breakage or misalignment in geometry, ensuring a realistic spatial relationship.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting, including the hanging lamp’s shadow and the light on the characters, maintain consistency and contribute to the natural appearance of the scene without unnatural contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is depicted with reflection and shading consistent across the panels. The lamp casts light that aligns with the shadowing on elements like walls and the character's surfaces, ensuring a uniform illumination. There is no stark or unnatural contrast between the light and shadowed areas, lending to a natural visual continuity.",
