      "question": "Do the transformed chalets maintain consistent roof slopes and chimney placements without geometric distortion or floating components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chalets are transformed with an icy appearance. The visual cues indicate that the roof slopes maintain their original angles, and the chimneys are still in their expected positions. There is no evidence of geometric distortion, and the placement of components appears cohesive. Using world knowledge, consistency in the structure typically reflects stability and craftsmanship in transformation processes, which appears to have been maintained here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glowing ice surface continuous across the slope and around the chalets without jagged edges, unnatural reflections, or inconsistent brightness patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the slope is covered with a glowing ice surface. The surface appears smooth and continuous without irregular edges or sharp interruptions. The glow maintains uniformity in brightness and lacks any bright or dark patches that would signal inconsistent glow intensity. Normally, artistic glowing surfaces aim for smooth transitions to create a harmonious visual effect, which is present here.",

      "question": "Do the ice-enhanced pine trees retain recognizable tree silhouettes with evenly distributed icicles and no fused or missing branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows pine trees enhanced with ice. The silhouettes of the trees are clearly recognizable as pine trees. The icicles appear to be distributed evenly across the branches, and there are no visible missing or fused branches which would distort the natural appearance of the trees. This transformation often strives to enhance natural formations while preserving their original structure for aesthetic appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the auroras positioned above the mountain range without overlapping the sun or creating unnatural light halos or disconnected streaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, auroras are present in the sky. They are positioned well above the mountain range, and no sun is visible to overlap or create light halos. The auroral streaks are continuous and fluid, fitting naturally into the nocturnal sky scene without showing signs of disconnection or artificial brightness transitions, which aligns with auroras' behavior in polar regions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the snowflake patterns on the chalet walls uniform in scale and orientation, and do they align naturally with the building's architecture without repeating or distorting at edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chalets display snowflake patterns on their walls. These patterns appear uniform in size and evenly spread across the walls. There is no visible distortion or repetition at the edges, which suggests careful application aligned with the buildingâ€™s structural lines. Snowflake decorations often aim for consistent and harmonious integration with architecture, as seen here.",
