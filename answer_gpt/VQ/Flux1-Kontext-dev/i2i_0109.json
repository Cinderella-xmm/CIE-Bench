      "question": "Does the plastic figurine maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the character's body, avoiding distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportion of the plastic figurine is noticeably different from a real human body, likely due to it being a stylized representation of a character. While the body seems distorted compared to a natural human, the exaggerated proportions are typical of figurines that emphasize certain character features like muscularity. The figurine does not have any evident broken geometric shapes or unnatural distortions typical of poorly designed objects.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added lighting effects around the plastic figurine seamlessly integrated with its surface and the surrounding desk, avoiding unnatural highlights or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a figurine holding a hammer that emits a glowing blue light. The lighting effects are consistent with the visual theme of the character and blend well with the body and the surrounding desk's background. There are no glaring mismatches in the lighting or obvious unnatural highlights or shadows that disrupt the visual coherence.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the hands of the plastic figurine holding the hammer retain natural textures and shapes, with no more than five fingers and no signs of ergonomic distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the hammer looks proportionate to the rest of the figure. The hand appears to be gripping the hammer securely, with all visible fingers intact and similar to natural human shape. There is no additional distortion or more than five fingers, which maintains ergonometric consistency for a figurine.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the plastic figurine retained a structurally sound head and face consistent with the character's identity, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a figurine where the head and face appear consistent in texture with the rest of the figurine's body. The soft blur face reflected does not affect the assessment since the structural integrity and character thematic style are maintained, based on the visual cues for what is present. Hence, the overall head and face area maintain an acceptable appearance for a figurine.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the armor and cape of the plastic figurine appear cohesive with the rest of the figurine, avoiding any unnatural textures or materials that disrupt the visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor and cape of the figurine are well-integrated with the design and are consistent with the rest of the figurine. They show coherence in texture and appearance, matching the intended fictional character attire without presenting any materials or textures that seem out of place or disruptive.",
