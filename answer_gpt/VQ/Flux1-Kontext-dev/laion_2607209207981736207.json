    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the metallic texture applied to the scanner's body exhibit consistent highlights and reflections that align with the light source direction, avoiding patchy or overly shiny areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scanner has been shown on a glossy, futuristic package design with a metallic-like effect around the central console area. The highlights and reflections are consistent with a light source coming from the top and slightly left of the image, creating a balanced glow without excessive shininess or patchiness. This alignment with the light source helps maintain uniformity and realism in the reflection patterns, indicating a well-applied metallic texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the holographic display integrated into the front panel with translucent edges and layered visual depth, maintaining alignment with the scanner’s shape and not appearing as a simple 2D overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a futuristic package where a sort of holographic representation exists around the central display area. The holographic display has a depth perception and translucent quality, ensuring that it conforms to the scanner’s original shape and geometry. This multi-layered effect gives it a dimensional appearance rather than a flat, 2D overlay, indicating a thoughtful integration into the panel’s design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the grid lines evenly spaced and aligned with the orientation of the device, forming continuous patterns without jagged edges or interruptions that suggest digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of grid lines or digital patterns around the scanner device can be observed. These lines are consistently aligned across the surface of the package illustration. The even spacing and smooth continuation of these patterns indicate a clean graphical application without visible digital artifacts or jagged edges, signifying good design execution.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tech-themed icons and branding clearly legible, properly scaled, and positioned in non-intrusive areas such as the lower corners or sides, without overlapping critical components like the control panel or paper path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, tech-style fonts and graphics including the word 'SCANNER' and possibly branding details have been positioned towards the top and side regions of the package. They are scaled appropriately to ensure legibility and are placed outside of the operational areas such as the control panel or paper path. This layout consideration helps prevent interference with functional components, maintaining clarity and aesthetic balance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the transformed packaging retain the same overall dimensions and spatial relationships between components (e.g., paper feed slot, control panel area) as the original scanner, preventing distortion or misalignment of key parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing Image B to Image A, the packaging design in Image B retains the structural integrity and spatial arrangements present in the original scanner. The key elements like the paper feed slot and control panel area appear to maintain their proportional distances and positioning, preventing any perceptible distortion or misalignment. This suggests that despite the design transformation, the original dimensions and relationships between the scanner’s components are preserved.",
