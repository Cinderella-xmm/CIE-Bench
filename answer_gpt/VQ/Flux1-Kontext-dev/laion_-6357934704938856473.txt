    "Question": "Q4: Does the cityscape background extend behind the robot without clipping through its limbs or body, and does it match the lighting direction and scale of the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cityscape background is appropriately positioned behind the robot without clipping into its limbs or body. The lighting direction of the background is consistent with the lighting of the robot, creating a cohesive visual scene. The scale of the background fits seamlessly, enhancing the depth and context without overshadowing the robot's presence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the robot’s limbs, weapons, and armor pieces correctly aligned and positioned without overlapping or floating elements that violate spatial logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's limbs, weapons, and armor pieces are accurately aligned and positioned, maintaining a cohesive spatial arrangement. There are no elements that appear overlapped inappropriately or floating without clear structural support, indicating a robust application of spatial logic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
