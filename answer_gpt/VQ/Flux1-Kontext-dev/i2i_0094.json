      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the metallic textures added to the camera body natural, maintaining the camera's structural coherence without visible artifacts or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera body features a steampunk metallic texture with a distinctively colored frame. The metal integration appears to be deliberate and does not disrupt the cameraâ€™s structure. It retains its coherence, with details like buttons and shapes preserved despite the texture change. This suggests a well-executed transition to an artistic style without losing structural integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lens maintain its original proportions and geometric shape, with metallic textures that appear authentic and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the lens maintaining its circular shape and consistent proportions, similar to Image A, while adopting metallic textures. The lens continues to look authentic, suggesting the metal texture overlay did not distort its geometric form.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tripod legs and head display metallic textures that are consistent with their original structure, avoiding damage to geometry or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tripod's legs and head are visually consistent with their original structure in Image A. The metallic textures are added in a way that respects the original form and proportions, avoiding any deviation or unnatural alteration.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the Nikon logo and other text labels naturally integrated into the metallic design, remaining legible and consistent with the steampunk style without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Nikon logo and text on Image B's camera are integrated within the metallic texture design, still legible, and following the theme. The steampunk styling complements the logo's appearance without making it seem out of context, maintaining visual coherence.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting, shadowing, and reflection on the camera and tripod consistent and realistic within the steampunk illustration style, contributing to the image's natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadowing in Image B are consistent with a steampunk atmosphere. The use of warm tones and shadows complements the metallic textures, making the illustration appear unified and realistic within the stylized context. The reflections are subtle yet appropriate to the metallic surface, contributing to the overall coherence.",
