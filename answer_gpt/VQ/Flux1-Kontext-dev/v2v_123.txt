    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges of the chibi-style 3D models seamlessly integrated with the photorealistic background without visible artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the chibi-style 3D models have a distinct cartoonish vibe that contrasts with the photorealistic background. While the characters are vibrant and smooth, there is a noticeable discrepancy between their stylized nature and the more detailed environment, which makes them appear somewhat separate from the background. This visual difference can create an effect where the integration doesn't appear seamless, as there are noticeable edges around the characters against the more realistic background.",
