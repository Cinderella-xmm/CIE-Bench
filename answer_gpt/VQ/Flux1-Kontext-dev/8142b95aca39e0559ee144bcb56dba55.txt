    "Question": "Q1: Are all six dolls proportionally scaled with consistent body structure, showing no distorted limbs, oversized heads, or irregular shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each doll is a representation of a figure wearing traditional attire and positioned on a desk. The scaling appears consistent across all dolls, with none showing oversized heads or distorted limbs. The shapes of the dolls are regular and proportional, indicating a uniform scaling process. By analyzing the evenness in proportions and symmetry in each doll, we can confidently say the scaling is consistent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do all six dolls clearly display the original figureâ€™s beard, headwear, and distinctive robe patterns in a simplified but consistent manner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figures appear with beards, headwear, and robe patterns that are simplified but maintain consistency across all dolls. The beards and headwear are distinct for each doll, with patterns on the robes mirrored faithfully from the original design, implying a systematic replication. By observing the decor motifs and such consistent detailing, these elements appear clear and consistent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the dark-wood desk textured realistically with visible grain, proper shadows, and correct scale relative to the dolls, and is it fully grounded beneath them without floating or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the desk appears to be a dark-wood table, with visible grain and shadows that add to its realism. The scale of the desk fits the dolls' size, and the alignment of the dolls on the desk is such that they do not appear to be floating or misaligned. The shadows and reflections on the desk corroborate their grounded nature.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the robes on the dolls exhibit smooth, curved folds consistent with a breeze, without jagged lines, unnatural stretching, or broken textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robes on all dolls display smooth curves and folds. These folds appear natural and reflective of how fabric would behave in a gentle breeze, without any jagged lines, distortions, or breaks in texture. This conclusion is drawn from the fluidity and natural appearance of the robe folds.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do all dolls have hands with exactly five fingers, properly shaped and spaced, without extra digits or deformed joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each doll's hands are examined to contain exactly five fingers that are spaced evenly and appropriately. There are no extra digits or abnormalities such as deformed joints visible, indicating that the hands are rendered in a typical human representation form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are the orange and blue colors consistently applied across all six dolls without color bleeding, mismatched tones, or unexpected gradients?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of orange and blue are consistently applied across all the effigies' garments. Observing the color application, there is no evidence of color bleeding or shifts in tone. The gradients appear smooth and intentional, which maintains the integrity and homogeneity of the dolls' appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
