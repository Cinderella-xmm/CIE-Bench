      "question": "Does the translucent green LEGO brick construction of the bottle’s body maintain a consistent cylindrical form without visible warping or misalignment between bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the bottle is constructed using what appears to be translucent green LEGO bricks, forming a cylindrical shape. The bricks are stacked in a way that maintains a consistent shape throughout the body without visible warping or misalignment. The cylinder appears smooth, suggesting that the LEGO assembly is done meticulously to avoid any distortions or irregularity in shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all brand text elements (e.g., \"BACARDÍ\", \"MOJITO\") and logos clearly identifiable and properly aligned on the LEGO label, without distorted letterforms or missing characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand text elements and logos such as \"BACARDÍ\" and \"MOJITO\" are clearly identifiable and maintain proper alignment as expected on a bottle label. The letterforms appear unaffected by the LEGO brick background, without missing characters or any noticeable distortion, which implies careful application of the label onto the LEGO surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the blue LEGO cap accurately shaped as a cylinder with consistent height and diameter matching the original bottle’s neck, and does it feature a smooth, rounded top without angular breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap is recreated using blue LEGO elements. It successfully forms a cylindrical shape that sits atop the bottle, matching the diameter of the bottle's neck similar to the original image. The top of the cap is shown to be smooth, maintaining the cylindrical integrity without any visible angular breaks or inconsistencies in height or diameter.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white shelf beneath the LEGO bottle flat, horizontally aligned, and free from irregular edges or floating segments that suggest poor integration with the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white shelf beneath the LEGO bottle appears flat and horizontally aligned, supporting the bottle consistently. There are no irregular edges or floating segments visible, which suggests it is well-integrated within the scene, providing a stable base for the depicted bottle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the smaller text elements such as \"natural mint flavor\" and \"Simply pour over ice\" fully visible and correctly spaced on the LEGO label, without overlapping or broken lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smaller text elements on the label, including \"natural mint flavor\" and \"Simply pour over ice,\" are fully visible and maintain correct spacing. The text does not overlap with itself or any other elements, and each letter is clear and intact, indicating proper handling of fine text detailing on the LEGO label.",
