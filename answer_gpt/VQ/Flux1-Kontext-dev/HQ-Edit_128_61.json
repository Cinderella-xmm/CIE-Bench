      "question": "Does the transformed tagine retain its original conical shape and base proportions, with no visible warping or deformation in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tagine retains its classic conical shape and pleasing base proportions, elements well-recognized in traditional cookware. The structural integrity appears maintained, as there are no signs of warping or distortion visible. When we compare with Image A, the shape and proportions remain consistent, thus confirming no deformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arabesque patterns and gem-like details on the tagine's surface evenly rendered with consistent texture, lighting response, and material properties, without any visible seams or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tagine is adorned with arabesque patterns and gem-like details. These elements are translated with symmetrical rendering and a smooth, consistent texture. The lighting response on these intricate details is uniform, without seams or sharp, unnatural highlights. This careful rendering indicates attention to detail and proper lighting application, maintaining realism in surface design and material portrayal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the smoke emerging from the tagine smooth, translucent, and flowing naturally, with a clearly defined but soft-edged genie silhouette that does not exhibit jagged lines or digital distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smoke in Image B appears smooth and translucent with a flowing, natural emergence from the tagine. Its genie-like silhouette is softly defined, suggesting a careful attention to fluidity and form. There are no visible jagged lines or digital distortions, indicating a seamless blend and a natural depiction in the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the metallic threads and jewel-like elements on the fabric appear embedded within the textile weave, with realistic reflection and shadowing that matches the surrounding material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not prominently feature metallic threads or jewel-like elements embedded in the textile Weave. Instead, the fabric is of vivid color and geometric pattern, suggesting a woven design rather than additional threaded details. There is lighting and shadowing consistent with the texture and material properties of the given textile, though without additional embellishments.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the tagine and the smoke consistent with the light source direction, and do they properly interact with the fabric and surrounding environment without floating or misplaced areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast by the tagine and the emanating smoke align well with the presumed light source, indicating a top-left direction. These shadows integrate smoothly with the fabric, adhering naturally to the environment without signs of floating or misplacement. This interaction underlines coherent light-source logic and spatial accuracy in the composition.",
