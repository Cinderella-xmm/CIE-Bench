        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the headwear is visually consistent with traditional Byzantine monastic cowls, exhibiting realistic folds, texture, and appropriate shaping. There are no visible seams, unnatural folds, or geometric distortions that would indicate artificial manipulation. The visual realism and coherence of the folds and texture in the headwear indicate a natural depiction.",
