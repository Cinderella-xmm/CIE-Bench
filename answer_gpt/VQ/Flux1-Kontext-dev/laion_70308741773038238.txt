    "Question": "Q2: Are the glass bases at the wheel positions transparent with visible internal texture, evenly shaped, and grounded flush with the platform without floating or clipping issues?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bases at the wheel positions resemble glass in color and texture, presenting a transparent appearance where one might expect wheels. These bases appear to have detail, suggesting internal texture. They are uniformly positioned enhancing the stability and aesthetic of the vehicle's presentation, grounded on the platform consistently without visible errors or discrepancies such as floating.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the embossed text along the side panel clearly legible, aligned with the body's curvature, and rendered with subtle depth and shadow to match the material?",
    "explanation": "The text on the side panel of Image B is bestowed with embossing techniques that ensure clarity and legibility. It follows the bodyâ€™s mild curvature, upholding the continuity of design without distortion. The depth and shadow are subtle yet effective, playing off the metallic material which allows the text to stand out adequately without unnecessary contrast.",
    "answer": "Yes"
