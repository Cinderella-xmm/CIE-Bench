      "question": "Does the mouse's fur texture appear smooth and maintain the natural look expected in a Pixar-style animation without unnatural or overly simplified patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur texture of the mouse is rendered smoothly, consistent with the style typically seen in Pixar animations. This style often simplifies details while still maintaining a believably natural appearance. The fur is glossy and plump, avoiding any overly simplified or flat patterns that would detract from its Pixar-like aesthetic. Pixar animations are known for their balance between realism and stylization, often creating textures that simplify complexity without losing authenticity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mouse's ears, eyes, and whiskers proportionally correct and not distorted relative to its body size in the Pixar animation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the mouse with exaggerated features typical of Pixar animation style, such as oversized eyes that convey expressiveness, rounded ears that complement a cute aesthetic, and long whiskers that add detail without seeming awkwardly proportioned. The proportions match the stylized look often favored in animations to enhance the appeal and character of tiny creatures, achieving the balance without distortion.",

      "question": "Do the soft shadows under the mouse and surrounding crumbs appear naturally integrated into the scene without any harsh or misplaced artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows under the mouse and surrounding crumbs are rendered with a soft gradient, seamlessly integrated into the floor. They contribute to the overall three-dimensional feel without any harsh lines or artifacts that would disrupt the scene's cohesion. Pixar animations often employ such integrated shadows to maintain a smooth, natural look, supporting character and object placement within the animated environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the floor's texture retain sufficient detail and pattern authenticity in the Pixar animation style, avoiding unnatural smoothing or artificial patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a floor texture that is consistent with the Pixar animation style, maintaining detail and pattern authenticity. While simplified in comparison to real-life textures, it preserves enough detail to avoid unnatural smoothing or artificial patterns, contributing to a believable setting that aligns with the stylized yet realistic environments typical of Pixar films.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crumbs' sizes and shapes consistent and believable within the context of the image, without displaying any unnatural irregularities or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows crumbs that vary slightly in size and shape in a manner that is believable within the context of the scene. The irregularity is subtle and intentional, reflecting real-world randomness of scattered crumbs, which is well captured in animated scenes that aim to marry stylization with realism. This approach avoids distortions that would appear unnatural within the context depicted.",
