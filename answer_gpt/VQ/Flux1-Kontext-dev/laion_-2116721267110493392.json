      "question": "Do the cartoon versions of the two boys have proportionally correct head shapes and facial features that align with typical human anatomy, without exaggerated or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon versions of the boys are drawn with typical stylized features common in animated characters. Their head shapes and facial features are exaggerated for aesthetic appeal, such as larger eyes and rounder heads. This is a characteristic style often seen in cartoons to make characters more engaging and expressive, which does not strictly adhere to realistic human anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cyan and lemon yellow furniture elements rendered with consistent material textures and lighting that match the surrounding environment, avoiding glossy or flat-painted artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses bold and colorful cartoon styling where the furniture, colored in cyan and lemon yellow, has a consistency in texture, where they appear flat due to the nature of animation art, often lacking nuanced lighting effects seen in realistic imagery. This style is intentional within the animated context, not indicative of artifacts.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floating books and elements are part of the animated style which doesn’t adhere to realistic physics or spatial depth—they do not cast shadows or respect real-world depth due to their whimsical, illustrative nature aimed at playful and imaginative storytelling.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robots and gadgets in Image B are drawn consistently in scale relative to the cartoon characters and feature smooth, uniform surfaces without visible digital artifacts. The cartoon art style allows for artistic liberties in scale and distance, capturing a playful environment free from notable rendering issues.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title text in Image B, ‘A Classroom Adventure’, is prominently positioned at the top of the image with bright, bold letters that are easily readable.
