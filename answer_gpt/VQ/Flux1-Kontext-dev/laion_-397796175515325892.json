        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a church's spire and rooflines, which are visibly clear and maintain structural integrity. The edited image presents a smooth and continuous design without any jagged breaks or warped segments. This observation suggests careful editing to retain clean architectural lines.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both halves of the church’s façade appear symmetrical with consistent window positions and wall contours. Regarding common architectural knowledge, churches often have symmetrical designs for aesthetic harmony, which is preserved in this edited version.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the spire and church body in a well-balanced proportion. The spire does not seem excessively stretched vertically and matches the church's structural harmony, reflecting standard architectural proportionality.",
