      "question": "Does the transformed teapot maintain a uniform cylindrical shape with smooth, continuous surfaces and no visible geometric distortions or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is replaced by a cylindrical container, which typically is expected to have smooth and uniform surfaces without distortions. The visual cues show that the cylindrical shape is consistent and symmetrical, with no visible irregularities or distortions. The logic in determining cylinder uniformity involves assessing the symmetry and lack of surface variation typical of cylindrical objects.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the golden foil floral patterns clearly embossed with consistent depth, proper lighting interaction, and no signs of blurred edges or artificial textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the cylindrical container appear sharp and embossed. The lighting interaction is appropriate, highlighting the features of the foil patterns without blurring or texture anomalies. Determining this involves assessing the clarity, lighting, and texture of the embossing, ensuring it simulates realistic foil characteristic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the redesigned cups stacked in a stable, physically plausible manner with matching rim sizes and lids that fit securely without gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a tea set, where cups are positioned separately rather than stacked, featuring lids fitting properly without visible misalignment. The analysis involves ensuring the lids' snug fit on the cups without gaps or forced placement. This is verified through visual observation of their alignment and orientation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Japanese calligraphy positioned at the top of the packaging with natural brushstroke variation and clear legibility, without clipping or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calligraphy on the cylindrical container is positioned centrally with variations in stroke weight typical of natural brushwork. The legibility is clear, and there are no distortions or clipping evident. Evaluating calligraphy requires checking for natural variation, readability, and any signs of digital artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bamboo motif along the side have consistent node spacing, natural grain texture, and smooth edges without repeating or distorted segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bamboo motif in Image B is presented alongside the container with consistent spacing of the nodes and an organic texture consistent with bamboo. The edges appear smooth without repetition or distortion, which involves examining the coherence of the motif design and edge clarity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the surface beneath the tea set completely flat, uniformly white, and free from any unintended shadows, textures, or reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the tea set is white and flat. There are no observable textures or shadows interfering with the uniformity of the surface. This involves checking for flatness and uniformity in color and absence of shadows or reflections typically found in reflective or textured surfaces.",
