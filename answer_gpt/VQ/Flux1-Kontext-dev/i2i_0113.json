      "question": "Does the character's face maintain its natural appearance and texture while integrated into the soft vinyl material without visible unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For this question, the analysis focuses on the integration of facial features with vinyl material. The analysis explores if any visible transition from realism to vinyl could introduce artifacts. With the face blurred, a detailed skin texture assessment isn't possible, so any conclusions hinge on evaluating non-visible details. Therefore, a firm determination is not feasible.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the character's body proportions and posture logically consistent and visually credible within the form of a soft vinyl figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To answer, observe the figure's proportions against familiar vinyl figure characteristics, such as a chibi style with exaggerated head or limbs. Image B exhibits these traits like shortened legs compared to Image A, fitting the vinyl figure form. Using world knowledge about chibi proportions and vinyl figures, the character's depiction is credible within this context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the character's suit retained its detailed textures and material realism without introduction of unnatural artifacts in the soft vinyl figure design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The assessment looks at the suit materials and detailed texturing, deciding if the transition to vinyl affected them. Comparing Image B to Image A shows a loss of texture detail, expected as vinyl styles often display simplified textures. This simplification doesn't cause artifact issues but aligns with typical soft vinyl representation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the interchangeable accessories, such as weapons and hand gestures, integrate seamlessly with the figure's design without disrupting its structural consistency or introducing visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Here, one examines the design transition's success. If Image B displays accessories contrasting with the main design or introduces visible artifacts, it's problematic. However, all elements incorporate seamlessly within Image B, suggesting the integration maintains design consistency without disruptions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character stand naturally on the black base without visible distortion or unnatural support, ensuring the figure's visual stability and plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyze whether the figure's balance on its base keeps to natural postures. Image B shows the character well-centered on the base, displaying balance typical of vinyl figures, with no apparent distortion or unnatural supports. It's stable and plausible visually.",
