      "question": "Are the roof, walls, and window frames of the Japanese house replaced with colored glass panels outlined by black lead without distorting the original building’s geometry or introducing misaligned or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cartoonish, stained glass style depiction of the Japanese house. The roof, walls, and window frames are maintained with lines reminiscent of stained glass outlines. Commonly, stained glass designs utilize lead lines for structure, and Image B's depiction achieves this style effect without distorting the house's geometry, introducing breaks or misaligned lines. The shapes and structure of the building elements like the roof and window frames are clearly outlined in black, consistent with stained glass art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the red trees on both sides of the house been converted into symmetrical floral motifs made of red and green glass segments that maintain their original placement and scale without unnatural stretching or fragmentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red trees appear as stained glass motifs fitting the style of the Japanese landscape. They use segments resembling colored glass panels but retain their form as trees rather than symmetrical floral motifs. The trees maintain their original placement and scale relative to the house, keeping the intended artistic style without distortion, stretching, or fragmentation. However, they are not converted to symmetrical floral motifs but depicted as tree-like shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the red moon represented as a series of concentric gradient circles in stained glass style, with smooth color transitions and no jagged edges or irregularities in its form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the moon depicted in a stained glass style but it is not represented as concentric gradient circles. The moon maintains a singular circular form consistent with stained glass art, having a consistent red color without smooth color transitions or additional concentric circles. The edges are defined and avoid jagged lines, maintaining the simple silhouette of the moon rather than introducing complex gradients.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all structural and decorative lines—such as those framing glass panels, outlining windows, and defining floral motifs—uniform, continuous, and properly aligned without breaks, overlaps, or uneven thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B makes use of structural and decorative lines typical of stained glass art to define shapes like window and roof edges, tree outlines, and other architectural elements. These lines are uniform in thickness and continuously connect without breaks or overlaps, maintaining proper alignment, as is characteristic of stained glass designs.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the reflections in the water accurately mirror the stained glass version of the house, red floral trees, and red moon with correct proportions, alignment, and color fidelity, without distortion or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection in the water in Image B maintains the stained glass styling evident in the reflection of the house and trees. The proportions and alignment reflect accurately with appropriate color fidelity. There is no noticeable distortion or blurring in the mirrored illustrating elements, ensuring the reflections are true to the depiction of stained glass imagery.",
