      "question": "Is the surface of the unicornâ€™s body uniformly smooth and reflective, resembling a glazed ceramic finish without patches of residual fur texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn's surface is analyzed to appear uniformly smooth and reflective; it looks like a glazed ceramic finish typical of porcelain sculptures. There is an absence of any fur texture that was present in the representation of a natural creature. This smoothness and uniform reflective quality are characteristic of materials like ceramics or polished plastics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mane and tail composed of thin, curved porcelain-like structures that follow the natural flow of the original hair and are securely attached to the head and base of the tail without floating or breaking apart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mane and tail in Image B are described as being made of thin, curved structures that mimic the flow of human or animal hair, but appear to be crafted from something akin to porcelain. These structures are solid and attached to the unicorn's body, rather than free-floating or separated, indicating a transformation from natural hair to a solid material while maintaining the hair's flow and attachment points.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the horn form a continuous, symmetrical spiral shape made of reflective metallic material, originating from the same position as the original horn and maintaining proportional size relative to the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horn maintains its position and proportion relative to the unicorn's head, signifying continuity with the original design. The horn is crafted to form a symmetrical spiral, characteristic of traditional unicorn depictions. It is described as being made from reflective metallic material, providing a visual contrast to its ceramic body and ensuring coherence in material properties consistent with traditional sculpture aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the unicorn positioned on a flat, subtly textured stone base that contrasts with the original forest floor, with no visible remnants of trees, dirt, or foliage in the immediate surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn stands on a clean, flat base that resembles stone or similar material rather than the natural elements found in a forest environment. There are no traces of trees, dirt, or foliage near its surroundings, strongly indicating a shift from a natural setting to an art gallery climate, focusing on the sculpture itself without environmental details.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting on the sculpture soft and directional, casting subtle highlights on the glazed surface and porcelain curls, consistent with indoor gallery illumination rather than outdoor moonlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the unicorn with lighting characteristics that are typically found indoors, such as a gallery or showroom context, where soft, directional lighting creates subtle highlights and shadows on the sculpture. This contrasts with the directional and more diffuse nature of moonlight which was present in the original scene. The highlights on the smooth and clearly defined surfaces like the body and hair indicate controlled lighting more consistent with indoor presentations.",
