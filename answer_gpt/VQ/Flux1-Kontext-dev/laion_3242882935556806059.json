    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the petal shapes preserved with jagged crystal facets that follow the natural curvature of the original lily petals, without visible warping or geometric breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petals maintain their natural shape and flow, reflecting an intricate design that mirrors the original lily petals seen in natural conditions. The subtle jagged facets incorporated into the design align well with the inherent curvature of lilies, showcasing an absence of any distortion or geometric incongruities. This conclusion is derived from observing the consistency and symmetry in the petal shapes which are typical for lilies.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glass rods extend naturally from the vase upward, matching the number and spacing of the original stems, without appearing disconnected or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass rods visible in Image B show an arrangement that corresponds to a natural extension of the stems visible within the vase. This arrangement, while visually abstract, suggests careful alignment to maintain aesthetic coherence, which is also indicative in the consistent spacing seen in floral arrangements. This suggests an alignment with standard botanical displays without disconnection or misalignment, as proven by world knowledge on floral symmetry and vase presentation.",

      "question": "Is the black marble surface beneath the vase smooth, uniformly dark, and reflective, with shadows and highlights consistent with the light source and object placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black marble surface beneath the vase appears to be well-polished with a reflective texture, typical of polished marble materials. It exhibits consistent shadows and light reflections indicative of a singular light source operation upon shiny surfaces. The distribution of highlights and shadows suggests a uniform texture, taking cues from physics principles of light reflection and absorption on polished surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the crystal petals exhibit subtle variations in amber hue and transparency, with internal light refractions and depth cues that suggest volume and translucency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal petals in Image B display variations in their amber hue, marked by transparent qualities allowing light refraction and reflection, suggesting translucent properties. These visual cues suggest depth, creating an impression of volume, which aligns with understanding of optics and crystalline structures in naturally occurring materials. These characteristics are indicative of depth in translucent gemstones, demonstrating layers and opacity variation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glass rods enter the water at angles consistent with refraction, showing slight bending at the waterline, and remain submerged without floating or disappearing mid-length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the glass rods properly entering the water with angles hinting at natural light refraction, a visual cue that aligns with the physics principle of refraction seen in glass-water interaction. The bending is subtle but indicates continuity through physical observation, where the rods appear well-submerged, showing no indication of floating or disappearance, principles consistent with transparent material interaction in fluid dynamics.",
