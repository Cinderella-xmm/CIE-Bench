    "Question": "Q1: Does the entire surface of the LEGO statue display uniform brick textures with no visible patches of residual wood grain or inconsistent material transitions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is constructed entirely from LEGO bricks, which inherently possess a uniform texture and appearance. The typical LEGO configuration implies consistent material composition without elements like wood grain. Observing Image B, the surface is indeed uniformly covered with LEGO bricks, showing no signs of residual wood grain or material inconsistency. Thus, the statue displays a uniform LEGO brick texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the detailed carvings on the headdress, chest plate, and belt represented by small, precisely placed LEGO bricks that preserve the original patterns without loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue replicates detailed elements like the headdress, chest plate, and belt using LEGO bricks. LEGO bricks usually have a fixed size and geometry that may limit highly intricate details. The visual cues show an attempt to mimic patterns through brick assembly; however, the precision may not be as high as the finely detailed carvings present in the original due to the nature of LEGO construction. Therefore, despite efforts to replicate patterns, the level of detail is likely reduced compared to traditional carvings.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the arms, legs, and torso of the LEGO statue maintain natural human proportions with correctly scaled joints and limbs?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a LEGO statue, which typically follows the design of LEGO figures known for stylized proportions, not entirely matching human anatomy. The arms, legs, and torso resemble the toy-like proportions characteristic of LEGO, deviating from a realistic human form. Hence, these parts do not maintain natural human proportions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do both hands of the LEGO statue have five distinct fingers with natural finger positioning and no signs of merging or deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO statue has hands fashioned in the typical style of LEGO figures, which often feature simplified shapes without detailed finger articulation. The hands lack separate fingers and thus, do not exhibit five distinct fingers with natural positioning. This characteristic aligns with standard LEGO design rather than realistic hand anatomy.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO statue centered on a flat white pedestal with realistic shadows and reflections that align with the lighting direction in the gallery?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the LEGO statue on a white pedestal within a gallery setting. The lighting produces shadows and highlights on the statue and pedestal, consistent with realistic light behavior. The shadows and reflections seem to align properly based on the apparent lighting conditions in the image. The statue also appears centered on the pedestal visually, indicating a coherent setup.",
    "answer": "Yes"
