      "question": "Do the chibi sheep maintain their original interaction pose by the railing in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi sheep are seen interacting near a railing structure in a humorous and stylized environment. This setup is effectively capturing the essence of the original Image A, where animals are similarly situated by a fence. The chibi characters, although stylized and simplified, maintain the thematic essence of animals gathering near a boundary. This indicates that their interaction pose, albeit now stylized, continues to be grounded in the original intent, showing similar posturing and relational proximity as in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the winter accessories (scarves, earmuffs, gloves) added to the chibi sheep free from unnatural textures and retain fine details similar to the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, showcasing a cartoonish rendition of the sheep, includes additional winter accessories like scarves, earmuffs, and gloves. In a cartoon style, these elements complement the simplified shapes and styles, integrating seamlessly without introducing inconsistencies or clashing textures. The design is coherent with the overall cartoon theme, utilizing color uniformity and clean lines, thus ensuring that these accessories enhance the characters without stepping outside of the adopted style.",

      "question": "Do the proportions and poses of the chibi sheep appear physically plausible and coherent with the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi style generally exaggerates or alters proportions for stylistic purposes. In Image B, although proportions are not realistic, they remain consistent and coherent within the chibi aesthetic standard. The placement and relative proportions of the sheep in the edited image create a harmonic scene. Their poses appear natural for the intended exaggerated style, conveying a whimsical interaction suitable for a cartoonish representation of a winter scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the flat, cartoonish style conversion of the sheep maintain a sense of realism without introducing obvious unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B adopts a cartoon style, it adheres to its artistic premises faithfully. The chibi sheep are devoid of stray marks, incongruous shadows, or unintentional distortions, ensuring the image remains clean and purposefully styled. The characters, though simplified, manage to translate the real-world appearance to a cartoon format effectively, avoiding discordant visual elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the edited image, including the chibi sheep and their accessories, preserve visual credibility and structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a structured composition, with characters positioned near a fence resembling a cohesive scene. The addition of accessories does not hinder the structural integrity but enriches the context, reinforcing a winter theme. The image's layout is balanced, and the relationships between elements (such as sheep, accessories, and backgrounds) suggest a thoughtful arrangement embodying consistency in style and design.",
