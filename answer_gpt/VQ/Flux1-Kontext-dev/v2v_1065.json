      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D figure maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the skateboarder's mid-action pose without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboarder within the snow globe retains the correct proportions and mid-action pose seen in Image A. Despite being encapsulated in the snow globe, the details of the figure do not suggest any distortion or alteration of the skateboarder's posture. A chibi-style often exaggerates proportions like the head, but here, the proportions are consistent with a realistic depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tiny palm trees and ramps inside the snow globe naturally integrated into the scene without introducing unnatural textures or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees and ramps inside the snow globe look consistent with the background scene from Image A. The objects do not display any unnatural textures or broken shapes, indicating that they have been integrated smoothly to maintain a coherent scene, mirroring the outdoor setting inside the snow globe.",

      "question": "Do the character's clothing and skateboard retain their fine details and natural textures inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the clothing and skateboard of the figure within the snow globe maintain the textures and details visible in Image A. The fabric and surface of the skateboard appear natural, without any indication of loss of detail due to scaling or texture conversion. This ensures that the representation inside the snow globe remains true to the original appearance.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe resting on the table near the window appear structurally consistent and visually credible with realistic light scattering effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a snow globe that is structurally consistent, with a clear and smooth surface. The light scattering effects, such as reflections and shadows cast by the sunlight entering through the window, contribute realistically to the overall appearance of the globe. This adds to the believability and visual correctness of the snow globe in its environment.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the snow falling inside the snow globe look natural and enhance the lively atmosphere without appearing artificial or out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of snow falling within the snow globe appears natural, contributing to a dynamic and lively atmosphere. The snowflakes do not seem overly artificial or misaligned with the scene, effectively enhancing the magical quality expected in a snow globe. The size and distribution of snowflakes are coherent, adding to the immersive experience.",
