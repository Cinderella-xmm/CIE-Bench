    "Question": "Q4: Is the positioning and trajectory of the frisbee in mid-air consistent with realistic motion, avoiding any apparent physical inaccuracies?",
    "explanation": "The frisbee in Image B is positioned above the space between the two characters, appearing to be in mid-arc as one might expect when being tossed between players. Its trajectory is believable given the hand positions of both individuals, maintaining the illusion of motion without introducing any odd angles or unrealistic positioning.",
