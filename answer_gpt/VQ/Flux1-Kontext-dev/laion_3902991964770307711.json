      "question": "Do the top portions of the candelabra now appear as transparent, tapered glass caps with realistic light behavior and smooth contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top portions of the candelabra have been replaced with transparent, tapered glass caps. These caps have a realistic light behavior, casting reflections and refractions typical of glass materials, which suggests transparency. The contours are smooth, indicative of a well-executed design with realistic materials, showcasing understanding of how glass interacts with light.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arms and central shaft replaced with smooth, uninterrupted gold-finish tubing that reflects light consistently and lacks visible seams or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms and central shaft are depicted as smooth and gold-finished. They have a consistent reflection and appearance that simulates high-quality gold tubing without visible seams or interruptions. This consistency indicates a well-maintained reflective surface without any structural breaks, showing an understanding of how polished metal surfaces appear.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the brand logo embossed on the base such that it blends naturally with the surrounding texture and does not introduce irregular depth or lighting anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand logo on the base appears to be embossed, integrating seamlessly with the texture around it. There are no visible irregularities in depth or lighting that would otherwise indicate artificial addition or design flaws. This natural blending shows an understanding of embossing techniques where light and shadow typically complement the design without anomalies.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floral-engraved patterns evenly distributed, following the contours of the candelabra without flattening, repeating unnaturally, or appearing as surface overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral-engraved patterns in Image B follow the contours of the candelabra seamlessly. They are evenly distributed and exhibit a consistent engraving depth, which follows the curvature naturally, without appearing as flat or artificially overlaid designs. This shows competence in creating engravings that adhere to the object's three-dimensional form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the script font label on the central tube follow the curvature of the tube naturally, without warping, stretching, or overlapping with other surface details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The script font label in Image B is positioned on the central tube of the candelabra and follows its curvature naturally. There is no noticeable warping or stretching of the text, and it doesn't overlap with other surface details. This ensures the text maintains readability and aesthetic appeal, indicating a good understanding of typography on curved surfaces.",
