    "Question": "Q1: Are the gold-finished surfaces of both cheetah figures smooth, reflective, and free of unnatural textures or patches that suggest digital artifacting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetah figures are coated with a gold finish that appears smooth and reflective. The surfaces exhibit a realistic metallic shine, and there are no visible patches or irregularities indicating digital artifacts. This suggests a high-quality rendering of the gold finish on the cheetah figures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the two golden cheetah-bottle figures symmetrically aligned with the central glass façade, and do they cast consistent shadows that match the lighting direction and surface reflection?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the cheetah figures symmetrically aligned with the glass façade, exhibiting uniform positioning on either side. The lighting direction and the surface reflection are coherent, with shadows cast consistently, enhancing the realism and spatial coherence in the alignment and overall presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
