      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the elderly man’s robe evenly distributed, continuous across folds and seams, and free from jagged edges or texture repetition artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The geometric patterns on the man's robe in Image B appear to be stylized as part of a digital artwork, making it challenging to assess real-world continuity or flaws. Nonetheless, the patterns are symmetrically placed and seem uniform across the robe, suggesting intentional design choice typical in digital art. There are no visible jagged edges or repetition issues, which indicates an even distribution.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the ornate wooden staff maintain a natural wood appearance with coherent grain direction, proper thickness, and no floating or detached decorative elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornate staff has a stylized, bright design, consistent with the digital artwork theme. The staff's decorative elements are intricately detailed and affixed to the top, indicating a coherent design, albeit not strictly natural. The thickness aligns with the artistic style presented.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors of the spice piles in the background visibly intensified but still physically plausible, without color bleed, haloing, or loss of individual grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spice piles are depicted with vibrant colors typical of digital enhancement and stylization. These intensifications are sharper than real-world representations and seem slightly exaggerated than plausible, causing slight color bleed. However, they retain individual distinction without losing texture detail typical in stylized illustrations.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the decorative border motif clearly defined, properly aligned with the image’s edge, and positioned without intersecting or distorting any existing elements such as people, stalls, or ground tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decorative border in Image B is meticulously applied, encasing the image composition cleanly. It does not interfere with the primary elements inside the frame. The border's alignment with the image's edge is precise, reflecting standard practices in digital illustrations to avoid distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the wooden box held by the man show consistent wood grain, proper shadowing under ambient light, and natural flower arrangement without distorted petals or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden box in Image B is artistically stylized, with flower arrangement depicted vibrantly as colored blocks which do not imply natural shifts. The wood grain is continuous in the illustration context, but real-world texture assessment might vary due to stylized form. Shadows are consistent within the digital artwork framework.",
