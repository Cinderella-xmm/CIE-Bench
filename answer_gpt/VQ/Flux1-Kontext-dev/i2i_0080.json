      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the dog's fur consistent and natural across both the left side and back views in the combined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the left side and back views of the dog show a consistent cartoon style with smooth and uniform fur texture. The illustrations maintain a similar technique and color palette, ensuring that the fur appears consistent and natural between the two perspectives. The shading and highlights are cohesively applied across both views, which aligns with world knowledge of a cartoon style rather than a hyper-realistic fur texture.",

      "question": "Does the dog maintain appropriate proportions between its front and back views without noticeable distortion or deformation in the combined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog from both the left side and back views shows consistent and natural proportions. The size of the head, body, and limbs align well, and there are no noticeable distortions or deformities when comparing the dog's front and back views. The dog's neck and body width remain roughly constant, suggesting appropriate cartoon anatomy knowledge.",

      "question": "Does the dog appear naturally positioned on the bed in both the left side and back views within the combined image, maintaining visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is depicted sitting naturally on the bed, with the left side view showing the body parallel to the bed’s width. The back view supports this position by showing both hind legs symmetrically on the bed, giving a realistic portrayal of balance. The position looks credible, indicating an understanding of how a dog might usually sit on a bed.",

      "question": "Do the dog's ears and tail retain clear details and natural textures without any unnatural artifacts in the combined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog's ears and tail in Image B remain consistent in style and texture with the rest of the cartoon illustration. The ears are drawn with smooth, clean lines and appropriate shading that maintains the look of floppy ears in a cartoon context. The tail’s detailing also remains simplistic yet effective, corresponding to the usual artistic style without any unnatural artifacts observable.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the overall aesthetics of the combined image maintain a natural and authentic appearance without any obvious inconsistencies between the dog’s left side and back views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aesthetics remain consistent and cohesive. Both views of the dog integrate seamlessly into the scene with complementary colors, lighting, and shading. The artistic style transitions smoothly between the perspectives, and there are no obvious inconsistencies like mismatched colors or distortions. The bed and background further provide a stable context that supports the visuals, enhancing authenticity.",
