      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre's body follows a stylized design typical of chibi artwork, emphasizing simplified features like large muscles and smaller proportions for whimsy.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
