      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cogwheel joints clearly defined, aligned with the frame's geometry, and rendered with consistent metallic texture and shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cogwheel joints can be seen as part of the mechanical transformation of the bike into a steampunk motorcycle. The visual cues show that these joints are integrated into the design, maintaining a consistent metallic texture across the entire modified frame. The geometry of the cogwheels appears to be well-aligned with the rest of the structure, suggesting a coherent connection with surrounding elements.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the carapace-shaped seat have detailed surface textures, proper curvature, and seamless attachment to the seat post without visible seams or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there isn't a traditional 'seat' as in Image A; instead, there's a shell-like structure that may act as a seat. This carapace-like component has detailed texturing and curvature expected of a design inspired by insects or armor, fitting the steampunk aesthetic. It is smoothly integrated into the overall design with no visible seams or warping, ensuring a visually seamless flow with the seat post.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the mechanical legs have realistic hinge mechanisms, correct proportions, and no overlapping or misplaced segments that break spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features mechanical legs that are designed to imitate a fusion of organic and mechanical structures. The hinge mechanisms appear realistic, with the proportions balanced against the overall size of the motorcycle. There is no evidence of overlapping or misplaced segments that would disrupt or hinder the structural believability of the image. The proportions and spatial arrangement of the leg components are carefully considered to maintain logical coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wingtips smoothly attached to the top tube, showing consistent copper coloring, reflective properties, and no jagged edges or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wingtips in Image B are visibly attached to the top tube in a way that complements the steampunk theme. The consistent copper coloring and metallic reflective properties enhance their visual appeal. The attachment of the wingtips is smooth without any jagged edges, demonstrating a careful and deliberate integration. The textures also appear uniform, avoiding any noticeable repetition that would distract from the overall aesthetic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the clock faces clearly visible, properly embedded in the handlebars, and free from texture artifacts, incorrect lighting, or distorted numerals/runes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the inclusion of clock faces within the handlebars is integral to its steampunk art style. The clocks are clearly visible, seamlessly embedded in the handlebars, and maintain clear numerals without distortion. The lighting and texture handling is managed well, avoiding artifacts and ensuring that the clocks enhance the visual complexity without detracting from it.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do all newly added mechanical elements (legs, joints, wings, clocks) share consistent material properties, such as metallic sheen, color tone, and surface imperfections, without abrupt visual breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all the newly added elements contribute to a cohesive steampunk design. The metallic elements, including legs, cogwheel joints, wings, and clocks, exhibit a uniform sheen and color tone that reflect a consistent art style. There are no abrupt visual breaks between these components, reflecting a deliberate design choice that unifies the mechanical elements into a single thematic expression with optimal surface detailing.",
