      "question": "Does the snowy tundra landscape appear naturally integrated with the Leaning Tower of Pisa without any visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the snowy tundra landscape surrounding the Leaning Tower of Pisa appears to be seamlessly integrated. There are no discernible seams or edges that suggest an artificial juxtaposition of the tower against the snowy background. The visual continuity supports a natural appearance, which indicates a careful editing process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the snowy tundra landscape consistent with the natural appearance of the original image, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture on the snow-covered ground and the trees appears coherent, with no evident unnatural artifacts. Since snow is naturally reflective and soft, the depiction on the ground and the trees seems consistent with what is expected in such a setting, providing a realistic look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the Leaning Tower of Pisa maintain its structural coherence and proportions against the new snowy tundra background, without any distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the Leaning Tower of Pisa in a manner that preserves its architectural structure and proportions. There are no signs of distortion or broken shapes within the tower, even when set against the snowy background, which indicates the integrity of the image editing process.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine architectural details of the Leaning Tower of Pisa been preserved, and does the snowy tundra background lack any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, including the columns and arches, are well-preserved and clear. The background maintains a consistent texture, indicative of natural snow, without any evident loss of detail that might occur in an edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the elements of the snowy tundra landscape, such as snow-covered ground and trees, appear physically plausible and proportionate relative to the size of the Leaning Tower of Pisa?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowy tundra landscape in Image B, including the snow-covered grounds and nearby trees, appears proportionate compared to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The scale and placement of these elements are believable and consistent, supporting the physical plausibility of the scene.",
