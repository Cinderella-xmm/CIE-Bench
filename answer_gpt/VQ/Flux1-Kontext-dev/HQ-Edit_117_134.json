      "question": "Does the surface of the piano exhibit a uniform caramel color with visible white and gold icing details that resemble real edible decoration, without unnatural textures or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano is distinctly designed to mimic a caramel hue, with intricate white and gold icing-like decorations that add to the impression of edibility. The surface appears smooth and consistent without any digital artifacts or textures that seem out of place for this style, offering a realistic representation of edible decorations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and spatial relationships of the pianoâ€™s components (lid, body, legs, pedals) preserved and correctly aligned, with no visible deformation or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The components of the piano in Image B, such as the lid, body, legs, and pedals, are proportionately aligned and appear structurally sound. Each element is in its correct position without distortion, suggesting the piano maintains its geometric integrity despite the artistic rendering.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the color transition from black to caramel seamless, with soft gradients and natural light interaction that matches the lighting in the room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a piano with a uniform caramel color; thus, there is no transition from black to caramel. As there is no black to caramel color gradient present to assess, the change itself is not applicable for evaluation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the keys appear as distinct, uniformly shaped sugar crystals arranged in a regular pattern along the keyboard, with no missing or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keys on the piano in Image B appear to be uniformly shaped, suggesting an assembly of sugar crystals. They are arranged in a regular and consistent pattern with no evident missing or misaligned keys, aligning with the intended aesthetic of the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the white marble tabletop beneath the piano flat, properly scaled, and displaying natural stone patterns and shadows that align with the light source above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the piano is a flat, white marble tabletop. It is properly scaled to accommodate the piano and features natural stone patterns. The shadows cast on it are consistent with an overhead light source, indicating careful attention to detail in maintaining a realistic presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all edges of the piano and its decorative elements sharp and clean, with no visible pixelation, smudging, or unnatural blending at boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of the piano in Image B, including its decorative elements, appear sharp and well-defined. There is no visible pixelation or smudging, and the boundaries are clean, suggesting high-resolution rendering and careful attention to detail.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the piano onto the marble table match the light direction from the chandelier and appear soft and naturally diffused?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows shadows cast by the piano that align with an assumed overhead light source, matching the direction of light. The shadows appear soft and naturally diffused, consistent with the characteristics of lighting typically diffused in such an environment.",
