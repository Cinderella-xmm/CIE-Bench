      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coat's texture appears to be uniformly presented with a consistent velvety finish. The color and texture seem natural without evidence of excess shine or detail inconsistency observable on the coat's surface. This assessment is based on the visual cues that suggest a smooth texture overall.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gloves maintain visual consistency in terms of their glossy appearance. The shape of the gloves aligns well with the expected shapes of fingers and the reflections appear natural without distorted joints or misplaced highlights, based on typical glove characteristics.",
