    "Question": "Q2: Do the surfaces of the teddy bear and motorcycle retain their texture details without appearing overly simplified or losing important features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the low-poly 3-D style results in a simplified aesthetic. The motorcycle surfaces show less intricate detailing compared to realistic or high-definition styles; for instance, fine metallic textures are basic and show minimal reflections or nuanced detailing. The teddy bear appears as smooth, lacking the texture detail typical of fur. Consequently, the surfaces appear simplified and have lost some important texture features.",

    "explanation": "Examining Image B, the proportions of the teddy bear relative to the motorcycle appear realistic and consistent with real-world expectations. There's a balance between the sizes of the teddy bear and motorcycle that mirrors how a small bear plush might sit on a toy motorcycle. Upon comparing with Image A, the proportions align similarly, showing no distortion or unrealistic scaling.",
