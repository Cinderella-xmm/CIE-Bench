    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features and tiny hands added to each cereal bar proportionally sized and positioned in a way that maintains the original rectangular shape of the bars without distorting their geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features and tiny hands added to each cereal bar are carefully placed so as not to alter the rectangular geometry of the bars. The features are located centrally on the top surface of each bar with small hands appended at the sides, ensuring the rectangular silhouette is preserved. This design decision balances whimsy with the structural integrity of each bar's shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cereal bar characters appear to interact with the pink flamingo mug in a physically plausible manner, such as touching or leaning toward it, without violating spatial logic or causing visual inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the flamingo mug and cereal bars are placed close to each other in the composition, there is no direct interaction or spatial overlap suggesting physical contact or interaction. Each element is positioned within its own space, and there are no visible indicators of direct interaction, such as shadows cast onto one another, which maintains spatial logic without creating inconsistencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the whimsical font placed above the cereal bar characters clearly legible, properly aligned, and free from artifacts such as jagged edges or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The whimsical font in Image B is clear and easily readable, following a perfectly aligned path above the cereal bars. The font style is consistent with the playful design of the image, featuring smooth edges and bright coloring, with no visible artifacts such as jagged edges or blurring, supporting effective readability and visual appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the added facial features and hands on the cereal bars preserve the original texture of the chocolate and cereal layers, without introducing unnatural smoothness, sharp edges, or missing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features and hands are digitally added, but they do not interfere with the texture of the chocolate and cereal layers. The texture appears consistent and retains its natural appearance, with no smoothness or sharp edges introduced by the edits. The cartoonish style complements rather than detracts from the tactile details of the layers.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tiny hands added to the cereal bars have a natural number of fingers (no more than five), proper curvature, and appropriate shadowing to match the lighting in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiny hands added to the cereal bars feature two visible fingers each, consistent with cartoonish visual styles where simplification is common. The curvature of these hands is smoothly rendered, fitting into the playful design element of the characters. However, there is a lack of shadowing under the hands, which would normally align with the lighting of the rest of the scene, thus showing slight inconsistency in realistic integration.",
