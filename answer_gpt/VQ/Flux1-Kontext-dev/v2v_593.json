      "question": "Does the Funko Pop figure box maintain a natural texture similar to the original kangaroo's fur, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure box displays a clear, smooth texture typical of printed packaging material, which contrasts with the natural fur texture of a kangaroo. Given the context and common knowledge of how Funko Pop figure boxes are designed, it is correct for the box to have a distinct printed look, which does not match the fur texture of the kangaroo. Therefore, there are no artifacts indicating an attempt to mimic fur texture, as these are different materials and purposes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style kangaroo figure inside the box retain the correct proportions and structural consistency, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style kangaroo figure appears appropriately designed with exaggerated features like large eyes and a rounded body, which is consistent with the typical aesthetic style of chibi figures. Common sense and world knowledge tell us that chibi figures are meant to have these playful proportions, so there isn't any distortion or deformation beyond what is intended by this art style.",

      "question": "Does the highly realistic kangaroo figure outside the packaging display detailed textures and lighting consistent with the original image, enhancing its visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kangaroo figure outside the box shows a highly realistic texture and lighting that matches well with the scene’s grassy environment and lighting conditions, comparable to the kangaroo in Image A. Given the detailed surface textures and consistent lighting, it enhances the realism and plausibility of the figure within the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the grassy base and hopping-related elements integrated naturally into the chibi-style kangaroo figure, without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grassy base and details related to hopping in the chibi kangaroo figure are designed to be playful and stylized, matched with the figure’s purpose as a toy or collectible. There are no visible issues of texture or detail loss, maintaining a coherent style. Integration seems intentional and appropriate for this type of product.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition and layout of the Funko Pop figure box and the realistic kangaroo figure beside it appear visually credible and structurally coherent within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the placement of the Funko Pop box beside the realistic kangaroo figure on the ground contrasts visually, yet aligns structurally within the outdoor pathway setting. Typically, Funko Pop boxes are seen in indoor environments; however, as presented, both items seem cohesively integrated within the background as part of a visually playful scene, supported by general knowledge of how such items can be used for creative or marketing purposes.",
