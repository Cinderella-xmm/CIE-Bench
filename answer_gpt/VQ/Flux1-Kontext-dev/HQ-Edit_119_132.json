      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the paws of the husky significantly larger than natural proportions but still maintaining smooth, rounded shapes without distorted edges or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the husky's paws are depicted in a more stylized and exaggerated manner, consistent with a plush toy design, exhibiting larger than natural sizes but with smooth and rounded shapes. There's a noticeable uniformity and precision in the shapes, indicating intentional design rather than any geometry errors. This is confirmed by the absence of any wrinkles or jagged edges, which suggests that the enlarged appearance is a part of a deliberate toy-like transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the entire body covered in a seamless, velvety fabric texture that uniformly replaces the original fur without visible seams, texture inconsistencies, or areas where fur remains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a husky that appears to be stylized as a plush toy, covered entirely with a consistent and even velvety texture that gives it a fabric-like appearance. The texture is uniform across the body with no visible seams or inconsistencies, suggesting a carefully crafted toy aesthetic. This fabric texture is complete and does not display any sections of natural fur, implying a full transformation from fur to a plush fabric.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes replaced with clearly defined, symmetrical embroidered patterns that maintain proper positioning and spacing relative to the nose and ears, without jagged lines or misplaced stitches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the husky are designed to appear as embroidered patterns typical of a plush toy, with precise and symmetrical shapes. The positioning of these eyes relative to the rest of the facial features, like the nose and ears, is accurate and proportionate. The lines are smooth without any jagged edges or misplaced stitches, supporting the conclusion that they are intentionally designed to have a neat embroidered appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tail appear significantly fuller and fluffier than in the original image but remain attached to the body with a continuous, cohesive shape and no floating or detached segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms the husky into a plush toy, wherein the tail does not appear distinctly highlighted to comment on its fullness or fluffiness. Instead, the primary focus is on the body and face coverage with a plush-like texture, and the emphasis on the tail is not notable in the second image. Therefore, a direct inference regarding the tail appearing fuller and fluffier than in the original cannot be adequately confirmed.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the original snowy landscape and surrounding trees been fully replaced by a clean wooden shelf and minimalist backdrop, with no traces of snow, trees, or sky remaining in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the husky set against a new background, a wooden shelf with an apparent minimalist style. This setting replaces the natural snowy landscape with trees from Image A, leaving no visual remnants of the original outdoor environment. The wooden shelf and clean background form an intentional, indoor setting, consistent with displaying a toy within a confined space, showing the complete shift in context.",
