    "Question": "Q1: Does the central green block retain its original geometric shape after being converted into a 3D chibi-style cartoon character?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central green block has been transformed from its original simple geometric shape into a 3D chibi-style cartoon character. The distinctive characteristics of chibi style include exaggerated features and a more rounded, less geometric aesthetic. Despite being animated, the green block in Image B retains its recognizably angular form with the additional round stubs on top, indicating its preservation of the original geometric shape in a stylized manner.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the red blocks redesigned as lively supporting characters free from unnatural textures and maintain their original structural integrity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the red blocks have been anthropomorphized into lively chibi-style characters with human-like faces and rounded arms, diverging from their original simple block structure seen in Image A. This transformation introduces animated features, which do not entirely maintain the original structural integrity, as the redesign is meant to give them a sense of liveliness rather than preserving their block-like rigidity.",

    "explanation": "The heart-shaped confetti in Image B is dispersed around the chibi-style characters in a manner that complements the overall design of the image. These elements are evenly distributed and do not cover or obscure any significant details of the surrounding figures, maintaining a clear view of the principal characters. The confetti adds to the playful atmosphere without distracting from or diminishing the detail of the chibi characters.",
