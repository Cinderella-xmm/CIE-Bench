      "question": "Are Mona Lisa's facial features, such as her eyes, nose, mouth, and smile, rendered naturally without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face of the Mona Lisa is blurred, making it difficult to assess directly her facial features. The depiction renders the facial area unnaturally, introducing artifacts that obscure the natural appearance. Generally, the rendering does not appear natural given the blurring, and any claims of artifact introduction would hold merit based on the observable image.",

      "question": "Does the color adaptation around Mona Lisa preserve structural coherence and avoid unnatural color blending or edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color adaptation, reflecting a Studio Ghibli style, uses flat, bold colors characteristic of animated adaptations. The execution does preserve structural coherence in maintaining the boundaries of shapes. The adaptation does not show unnatural blending or edges but maintains a consistently structured aesthetic over this stylistic interpretation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited background in Studio Ghibli style retain its visual plausibility and avoid breaking the geometric shapes seen in the original painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B's Studio Ghibli style background to Image A, the original painting, the edited version uses simpler, bolder lines and colors common to animated formats. While geometric precision is slightly reduced due to the stylistic choice, visual plausibility in this context is retained; the background elements correspond with those in Image A without breaking key geometric structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the textures and folds of Mona Lisa's dress depicted in a way that avoids unnatural patterns and maintains a realistic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a simplified animated version of Mona Lisaâ€™s dress, indicative of the Studio Ghibli style. Unlike the intricate texturing found in Image A, this simplification for animation does not create unnatural patterns. Though less detailed, the design retains a coherent structure linked logically and aesthetically to the original.",

      "question": "Do Mona Lisa's hands in the Studio Ghibli style maintain a natural appearance with correct finger count and ergonomic positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Mona Lisa's hands feature the correct finger count and maintain a generally accurate ergonomic positioning. The simplification inherent in Studio Ghibli styling does not compromise the overall authenticity of hand depiction relative to natural anatomy, nor does it cause visual artifacts in this part of the image.",
