    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed object maintain a continuous, symmetrical egg-like shape with no visible breaks, jagged edges, or misaligned contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is shaped like an egg and has been painted with intricate designs, such as a phoenix, which is a mythical bird often associated with fire. The egg shape is smooth and symmetrical, with no visible breaks or jagged edges. The contours are well-aligned, providing a cohesive and continuous form. Using world knowledge, we know that symmetrical structures are aesthetically pleasing and are often a focus in design, especially in decorative items.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the feather-like patterns seamlessly integrated into the surface, with consistent line thickness, shading, and color gradients matching the original level of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features feather-like patterns that are incorporated into the design of the egg. The patterns have consistent line thickness, shading, and vibrant color gradients that match the level of detail typically seen in high-quality decorative objects. They blend harmoniously with the creature motifs and do not deviate in thickness or shading. This seamless integration shows expertise in artistry and attention to detail.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wing-shaped handle smoothly connected to the body of the egg, with realistic feather layers and no visible gaps or distortions in its curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a wing-like design that seems to emanate from the phoenix illustration on the egg. The connection appears smooth, with layered feather textures that enhance the realism of the design. The curvature of the wing shape has no distortions or gaps, which is crucial for maintaining the aesthetic appeal and functionality in terms of design continuity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the nest-like rim have a layered, organic structure with consistent material texture and properly placed jewel accents that do not appear displaced or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the egg rests in a simulated nest, characterized by its organic texture and layered structure that mimics twigs or woven material. The jewel accent on the rim is well-placed and integrated into the design, appearing naturally embedded rather than floating or displaced. This coherence in textural detail and jeweling indicates careful craftsmanship and design intent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing embers produce a subtle luminous effect that enhances the patterns without causing blurring, color bleeding, or unnatural highlights on adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing embers in Image B are depicted around the egg, creating a luminous effect. The way these embers are rendering enhances the vibrancy of the pattern without causing any blurring or color bleeding into the surrounding areas. They do not create unnatural highlights or distractions but rather contribute to the thematic portrayal of fire and rebirth associated with the phoenix, maintaining the visual integrity of the design.",
