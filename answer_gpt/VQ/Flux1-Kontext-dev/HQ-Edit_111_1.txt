    "Question": "Q1: Do the exaggerated muscles on the athlete’s arms, shoulders, and abdomen follow natural anatomical contours without introducing unnatural bulges or broken shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the muscles appear overly defined and have exaggerated contours due to the color enhancement and editing effect which introduces unnatural bulges and shapes not found in typical anatomical structures. These effects come from the added contrast and saturation, which alter the appearance of the muscle definition compared to typical human proportions.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the fiery red gloves with gold accents visually consistent in material texture and color, with no visible seams, pixelation, or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the color saturation and the contrast has altered the gloves’ appearance, creating a more stylized, high-contrast look. This effect can introduce inconsistencies in texture and color perception, with potential pixelation and highlights appearing unnatural due to these enhancements. Hence, they do not appear consistent in material texture.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the strobe lights in the background evenly distributed and consistent in direction and intensity, without creating unnatural shadows or light leaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the strobe lights are heavily edited, showing intensified colors and effects that might seem uneven in distribution and intensity due to editing enhancements. The result can cause inconsistent shadows or light leaks which are particular results of heightened color and effect enhancements.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the composition balanced and framed appropriately so that the central figure and key elements (gloves, stance, lighting) remain clear and undistorted when scaled for print?",
    "explanation": "Image B features enhanced effects that may affect the clarity and distortion of the image due to color saturation and contrast adjustments. These alterations could result in distortion when the image is scaled for print, as heightened effects impact the visual balance and composition clarity.",
    "answer": "No"
