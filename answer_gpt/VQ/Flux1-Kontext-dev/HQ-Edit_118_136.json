      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the metallic armor on the skater's torso and limbs maintain anatomical proportions and avoid unnatural bends or stretched shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a skater with neon-like highlights on the garments rather than traditional metallic armor. The anatomy of the skater suggests a natural pose, without any exaggerated or unnatural bends. The body proportions appear consistent and realistic, which confirms that the neon-like highlights maintain the anatomical proportions appropriately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hoverboardâ€™s transparent deck visually consistent in shape and structure, with no broken edges or misplaced glow effects that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard (interpreted here as a hoverboard with glowing wheels) retains a solid and consistent shape. There are no apparent broken edges or visual inconsistencies that would suggest digital artifacts. The glow effects are consistently applied along the edges of the board, supporting a clean and intact appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the graffiti elements on the ramps and walls rendered as animated digital displays rather than static paint, with smooth transitions and no pixelation or jagged outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases graffiti elements that have been transformed to reflect a more vibrant, neon style under a blue and purple lighting scheme. While the colors appear vivid and dynamic, they still resemble traditional graffiti in terms of their application on static surfaces, such as ramps and walls, without animation effects. There is no evidence of these being digital displays, as the transitions and outlines do not exhibit characteristics of animation.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the neon highlights on the armor and hoverboard cast soft, consistent glows on nearby surfaces without creating harsh, unrealistic reflections or color bleed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neon highlights on the skater's outfit and skateboard in Image B are designed to blend into the overall aesthetic, creating a consistent glowing effect that matches the environment. The reflections and glows are soft, without noticeable harsh lines or color bleeding that would detract from the natural appearance of the scene in this stylized lighting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the motion lines positioned along the trajectory of the skater and hoverboard, following natural flow without intersecting or overlapping key features like limbs or the board in an implausible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no explicit motion lines visible around the skater or the board. The dynamic pose and stylized glow suggest movement, but this is achieved through the use of light and color rather than explicit motion lines. Therefore, the absence of intersecting or misplaced motion lines confirms that the natural flow of movement is preserved without awkward intersections.",
