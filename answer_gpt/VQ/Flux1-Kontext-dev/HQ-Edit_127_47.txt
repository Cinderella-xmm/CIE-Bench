    "Question": "Q1: Are the trees, mountains, and water inside the glass orb correctly proportioned and undistorted despite the spherical enclosure, with no visible warping or bending of vertical lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection within the glass orb shows the trees, mountains, and water without any visible warping or distortion. Despite the spherical shape of the orb, the vertical lines of the trees remain straight and undistorted. The natural landscape appears proportional and accurate, even when viewed through the curvature of the glass, suggesting effective image editing to counteract typical spherical distortions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the ducks retain their natural body shape and size relative to the water and rocks, with smooth, reflective surfaces that do not show exaggerated shine or unnatural specular highlights?",
    "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the ducks maintain a natural shape and are proportionate relative to the water and surrounding rocks. Their surfaces appear smooth and reflective, typical of waterfowl, without any exaggerated shine or overly bright specular highlights that would make the ducks appear artificial or plastic-like. This congruence in texture and specular lighting indicates a well-executed blending into the natural environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the water beneath the ducks transparent enough to clearly see the rocky bottom, with no visible layering artifacts, texture tiling, or unnatural opacity variations?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the water beneath the ducks appears naturally transparent, allowing the rocky bottom to be clearly visible. There are no signs of layering artifacts or texture tiling, and the water maintains a consistent opacity, contributing to the overall realism and seamless integration of the water with its surroundings. This realistic depiction avoids any abnormalities that would suggest digital manipulation errors.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the miniature animal figurines positioned on solid surfaces (rocks or ground), properly scaled compared to surrounding elements, and free from floating or unnatural shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature animal figurines are clearly positioned on solid surfaces, like rocks, at the base of the orb. They are properly scaled relative to the surrounding elements of the scene within the orb, ensuring coherence in scale and proportion. There is no evidence of floating or awkward shadows, suggesting accurate physical contact and appropriate shadow casting, indicative of realistic lighting and placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the wood base have a natural grain pattern and cast a consistent shadow under the orb, indicating physical contact and realistic lighting interaction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wood base of the globe exhibits a natural grain pattern, consistent with what one would expect of a wooden texture. The base casts a shadow under the orb, which is consistent and appears naturally integrated into the environment, suggesting realistic lighting interaction. This congruence in texture, shadow, and physical contact supports the realism of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
