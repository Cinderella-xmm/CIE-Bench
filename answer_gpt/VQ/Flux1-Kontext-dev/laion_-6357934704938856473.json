    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brushed metal and matte finishes applied consistently across the robot’s body without visible texture artifacts or inconsistent sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B exhibits a consistent application of brushed metal and matte finishes across its body. The sheen is uniform, indicating careful rendering without texture artifacts. The surfaces appear smooth and integrated into the design without any visual discrepancies that would suggest inconsistency in material application.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hexagonal box fully enclosed around the robot with clean edges, proper proportions, and a clearly legible \"MECHA VANGUARD\" label without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hexagonal box in Image B is appropriately enclosing the robot, demonstrating clean edges and well-maintained proportions. The 'MECHA VANGUARD' label is prominently displayed at the bottom of the box and appears clear and undistorted, reflecting a high-quality design that preserves text clarity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the engraved details on the armor plates and weapon surfaces clear and non-blurry, and do the joint areas (elbows, knees) show no signs of geometric distortion or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the robot's armor plates and weapon surfaces display clear and sharp engraved details, indicating precision in digital design. The areas around the joints like elbows and knees maintain their geometric integrity without distortion or any missing segments, suggesting a meticulous adherence to design logic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the cityscape background extend behind the robot without clipping through its limbs or body, and does it match the lighting direction and scale of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cityscape background is appropriately positioned behind the robot without clipping into its limbs or body. The lighting direction of the background is consistent with the lighting of the robot, creating a cohesive visual scene. The scale of the background fits seamlessly, enhancing the depth and context without overshadowing the robot's presence.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the robot’s limbs, weapons, and armor pieces correctly aligned and positioned without overlapping or floating elements that violate spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's limbs, weapons, and armor pieces are accurately aligned and positioned, maintaining a cohesive spatial arrangement. There are no elements that appear overlapped inappropriately or floating without clear structural support, indicating a robust application of spatial logic.",
