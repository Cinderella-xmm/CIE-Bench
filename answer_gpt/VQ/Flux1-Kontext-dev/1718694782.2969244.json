      "question": "Are the motion lines surrounding the character in Panel 1 smoothly aligned with the direction of motion and free from jagged edges or inconsistent spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motion lines in Panel 1 of Image B are designed to emphasize the character's leap and are aligned with the direction of motion. Drawing from world knowledge of comic and animation design, motion lines should typically follow the contour of the action smoothly and consistently. There are no visible irregularities or jagged edges that would disrupt the illusion of smooth motion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the internal monologue bubble positioned close to the character’s head without overlapping facial features or distorting the character’s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comic panels, speech and thought bubbles are strategically placed to convey dialogue or thoughts without disrupting the character's visual appearance. In Panel 1, the monologue bubble is positioned near the character's head, keeping a respectful distance that avoids interference with facial features or altering the overall silhouette. This placement is consistent with standard comic practice.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sky background in Panel 1 display a smooth gradient from warm to cool tones without visible color bands or unnatural transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A well-executed gradient in visual arts smoothly transitions between colors without abrupt changes or banding, especially in sky backgrounds. In Panel 1, Image B shows a gradient that transitions from warm sunset tones to cooler hues, characteristic of a setting sun. The transitions appear smooth and natural with no visible bands disrupting the progression.",

      "question": "Is the parachute in Panel 2 correctly shaped, proportionally sized relative to the character, and connected by visible cords that extend logically from the character’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2, the parachute visually matches expectations of an effective parachute design, both in shape and size relative to the character. The cords connecting the parachute to the character are clearly visible and logically extend from his back, depicting an appropriate connection required for parachuting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the animated clouds in both panels appear as distinct volumetric forms with soft edges and no clipping into the character or mountain silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds in both panels of Image B are depicted with soft edges and rounded volumetric forms characteristic of cartoon-style clouds. They do not show any visual intrusion or overlap with the character or mountain outlines, maintaining clear separation and visibility as individual elements.",
