      "question": "Are the sunglasses on the horse's face free of unnatural textures and artifacts, maintaining a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses on the horse appear to be smoothly integrated into the scene, without visible textures or artifacts that suggest poor editing. The glasses look natural on the horse's face, blending well with its features. By considering common editing techniques, the lack of visible artifacts indicates a high-quality edit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the horse's facial structure maintain structural consistency and visual credibility despite the addition of sunglasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's facial structure does not appear distorted or inconsistent. The sunglasses fit well within the natural contours and proportions of the horse's face. This indicates that the editing respects the anatomical structure, maintaining credibility.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the horse's fur texture and details preserved without any loss or unnatural artifacts introduced by the sunglasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the fur texture around the sunglasses does not display any obvious signs of loss or artificial artifacts. The fur remains detailed and continuous, consistent with what would be expected from quality editing practices that maintain natural textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sunglasses' material and reflections appear realistic and consistent with the lighting conditions of the sunset scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the appearance of the sunglasses includes realistic reflections that match the lighting conditions of the sunset scene. The way the light interacts with the material of the sunglasses seems consistent with the overall warm lighting, indicating believable material characteristics.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the horse's eyes visible and undistorted under the sunglasses, preserving their natural shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses effectively cover the horse's eyes, preventing visibility. However, this does not impede the understanding that the underlying structure beneath the sunglasses remains undisrupted, thus preserving the natural position indirectly, assuming quality editing standards.",
