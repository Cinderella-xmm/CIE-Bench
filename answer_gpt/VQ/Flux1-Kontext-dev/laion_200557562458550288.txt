    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features added over the star motif proportionally aligned and integrated without distorting the star’s shape or creating unnatural edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features seem to be placed over an area that was occupied by the star motif on the jersey. The new features do not cover or distort the star shape, nor do they create any edges that appear unnatural when considering the ratio and proportionality on the jersey design. Since there's no detection of distortion around the star motif itself, it suggests that any added features over this area have been integrated smoothly without altering the original design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the motion lines surrounding the character have smooth, consistent strokes that align with the jersey's design language and do not exhibit pixelation or clipping artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B features motion lines surrounding the cyclist character, which are designed to match the colors and styles present in the jersey itself (blue, white, orange). These lines exhibit smooth and consistent strokes that reflect typical design elements seen in motion graphics, matching the dynamic feel of the jersey design. The lines are clear without showing pixelation or clipping artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are all newly added elements (facial features, motion lines, tagline) rendered using only the original jersey’s color scheme (blue, white, red, gray), with no unintended color bleed or mismatch?",
    "explanation": "The elements in Image B, including the facial features, motion lines, and tagline, have been visually assessed for color scheme adherence. They incorporate the blue, white, red, and hints of gray found in the jersey. Additionally, the motion lines include orange to add visual dynamism, and there is no mismatch in the existing jersey colors. The complete visual is rendered cohesively without unintended color bleed beyond these attributes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the tagline 'Ride Like a Star!' positioned diagonally in the bottom-left corner without overlapping or obscuring existing text or graphics, and is it clearly readable without distortion?",
    "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the 'Ride Like a Star!' tagline is located prominently near the bottom of the composition. It is displayed diagonally along the design, not obstructing or overlapping any essential jersey text (e.g., 'Dallas' or 'Your Name'). The tagline remains clearly readable, suggesting careful layout choice without distortion affecting visual clarity or text legibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the fabric texture of the jersey, including the repeated 'DALLAS' pattern and mesh-like sections, remain intact and undistorted even in areas near the added facial features and motion lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the jersey shows a textured pattern that includes repeated 'DALLAS' text and mesh-like areas. Although motion lines and facial features have been introduced, these additions do not appear to have disrupted or distorted the original texture and pattern of the jersey. Visually, the integrity and design consistency look well-preserved, with no signs of distortion in the fabric texture even near the added elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
