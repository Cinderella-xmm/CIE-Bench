      "question": "Do the chibi-style sheep retain proportional accuracy and structural coherence relative to their original poses near the fence in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style sheep are represented in a highly stylized, cartoonish manner, which inherently alters their proportions compared to real animals. Chibi art typically features exaggerated heads and simplified body forms for a cute aesthetic, which deviates from realistic proportions and poses. In contrast, Image A shows real sheep with natural proportions and poses characteristic of actual animals. Therefore, the chibi sheep in Image B do not retain proportional accuracy or structural coherence in relation to the real sheep near the fence in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the added accessories (red scarf, knit hat, and small bell) free of unnatural textures and logically placed on the chibi sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays chibi sheep with added accessories like a red scarf, knit hat, and small bell. These items are drawn with clean lines, flat colors, and are appropriately placed to fit the chibi-style sheep figures, consistent with the aesthetic of cartoon characters. Such accessories logically enhance the chibi sheep's appearance without introducing unnatural textures, as they are meant to provide visual interest in alignment with the playful art style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the thick white outlines and flat colors applied to the chibi sheep create a visually coherent and artifact-free appearance, maintaining their structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi sheep are outlined with thick white borders, and their colors are flat and bright, which is characteristic of sticker or chibi art style. This style choice ensures a crisp and clean boundary between the characters and the background, enhancing their visual coherence and maintaining their structural integrity without noticeable artifacts. It is consistent with creating a well-defined and polished look typical of chibi illustrations.",

      "question": "Does the positioning of the chibi sheep near the fence remain visually credible, preserving their original spatial relationship with the environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi sheep are shown in a completely different context from Image A. The background contains no fence or spatial environment to relate to their original positions. The chibi sheep are standalone illustrations not meant to interact with or relate to Image Aâ€™s physical environment, thus breaking the spatial and contextual relationship that existed in the original image.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background successfully made transparent without visible artifacts or remnants of the snowy landscape affecting the clean appearance of the chibi sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features chibi sheep against a gradient background that suggests an isolated, clean setting without interference from a prior snowy landscape. There are no visible artifacts or remnants of the snow from Image A, indicating that any background elements have been successfully removed or replaced, maintaining a clean appearance for the characters.",
