      "question": "Does the marble grotto structure exhibit uniform stone-like texture and natural veining throughout, without artificial-looking smoothness or irregular patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grotto structure appears to have a smooth, polished surface with gold detailing that lacks natural stone-like texture or veining. This suggests an artificial look which contrasts with genuine stone surfaces known for natural irregularities and veins.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
