      "question": "Have the brushstrokes added to the sofa preserved its structural integrity without causing distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the brushstrokes applied to the sofa reflect a Van Gogh-style interpretation, characterized by swirling patterns and bold lines. These stylistic strokes do not introduce any apparent distortion or unnatural textures that would disrupt the perception of the sofa's structural integrity. The sofa maintains its recognizable form with consistent proportions, despite the artistic embellishments. The robustness of the design is preserved, ensuring that the addition of brushstrokes does not compromise its depiction as a comfortable seating object.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the wall, including the framed painting, appear naturally integrated with the rest of the room after the style conversion, without any broken geometric shapes or lost fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall and the framed painting are rendered with a Van Gogh-inspired style, characterized by swirling and dynamic brushstrokes. This stylistic conversion effectively integrates the wall and painting into the overall composition without creating broken geometric shapes or losing essential details. The painting maintains a cohesive and harmonious presence, with the transition of color and strokes blending naturally into the room's atmosphere, preserving the intended spatial relationships and continuity of the elements depicted.",

      "question": "Are the plant's leaves depicted with Van Gogh-style brushstrokes while still retaining a recognizable and plausible appearance without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the plant's leaves are stylized with prominent brushstroke patterns akin to Van Gogh's technique. Despite the artistic approach, the leaves retain their fundamental leafy structure, ensuring that their depiction remains recognizable and plausible. The strokes accentuate the texture and complexity of the foliage while respecting the natural form and avoiding the introduction of any unnatural artifacts that might distort their appearance.",

      "question": "Has the side table and lamp been converted to fit the Van Gogh style while preserving their realistic proportions and physical logic, avoiding any distortion or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the side table and lamp through the lens of Van Gogh's style, employing textured strokes to enhance their visual appeal. Despite the artistic rendition, both the table and lamp maintain their realistic proportions and satisfy the principles of physical logic, such as balance and stability. The conversion successfully integrates these items into the scene without significant distortion or an evident loss of intricate details crucial for their identification and functional understanding.",

      "question": "Do all elements in the room maintain a harmonious and plausible arrangement in Van Gogh style, ensuring no disruption in the spatial relationships among objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, each component—ranging from the sofa, the wall, the artwork, the plant, to the side table and lamp—has been artistically interpreted through Van Gogh's characteristic brushwork. This cohesive stylistic application enhances the visual unity within the room. Despite the introduction of expressive brushstrokes and vibrant colors, the spatial relationships among the objects remain undisturbed. The arrangement retains a harmonious composition, where the aesthetic transformation compliments rather than disrupts the intended layout and interaction between elements.",
