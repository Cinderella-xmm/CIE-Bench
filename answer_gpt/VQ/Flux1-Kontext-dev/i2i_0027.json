      "question": "Does the dog's body maintain a natural and structurally consistent pose in the chibi-style, without any noticeable distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is rendered in a chibi style characterized by exaggerated proportions, notably a larger head and smaller body. Despite this stylization, the pose is natural, with the dog sitting on a green base and holding the ball. These proportions and pose are common in chibi art, where structural consistency is maintained despite the exaggerated features. This style is often used to convey cuteness without distortion. Thus, the pose is consistent with chibi conventions, showing no distortion beyond stylistic choices.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the enlarged head been integrated naturally into the image, without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The integration of the dog's enlarged head in Image B appears smooth and natural, relative to chibi style conventions. The head is proportionate and seamlessly attached to the body, maintaining a consistent texture and color. This art style often involves enlarging the head for cuteness, which has been executed well here. The eyes are large and expressive, fitting the style without visible artifacts or texture issues, ensuring the change is intentional and visually coherent.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tennis ball touching the dog's nose in a way that looks natural and physically plausible, without any awkward positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball is positioned near the dog's mouth rather than nose, which is a plausible interaction given how animals often engage with their toys. The dog's paw is on the ball, suggesting it is playing or keeping the ball close, making the setup and positioning natural, with no awkwardness in alignment. The close engagement visually adheres to realistic spatial interactions between a pet and its toy.",

      "question": "Does the relief tennis ball pattern on the base match well with the rest of the scene, contributing to a cohesive and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base under the dog features a relief tennis ball pattern that matches the ball's focus in the scene. This thematic consistency helps tie the elements together visually. The green color of the base complements the green of the tennis ball, enhancing cohesion. The relief pattern integrates neatly without overshadowing or clashing with other visual elements, contributing to a balanced appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the edited image retained the original focus on the ball while successfully integrating the chibi-style elements, resulting in a balanced and visually coherent composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B retains the focus on the tennis ball by placing it prominently near the chibi-style dog, maintaining visual continuity with bright colors that draw attention. The transition to chibi style, characterized by the dog's larger head and eyes, does not detract from the ball's presence, instead providing a whimsical context that enhances the composition's charm. The image balances both elements effectively, keeping the visual focus intact.",
