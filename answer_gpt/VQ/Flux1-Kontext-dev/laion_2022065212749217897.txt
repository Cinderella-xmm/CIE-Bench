    "Question": "Q1: Is the head disproportionately large compared to the body but without stretched or compressed facial features?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a figure with a large head compared to the body, which is typical of chibi or cartoon-like representations. The figure's head is large and round, aligning with a common design choice in stylized figures. The body is smaller, enhancing the sense of disproportionality typical of the genre; however, the facial features are not visible due to the blurred area. Nevertheless, the overall structure suggests a typical chibi representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) clearly visible and proportionally accurate despite the enlarged head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are obscured by a blurred area. While the head is enlarged, there is no direct insight into whether the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) are clearly visible or proportionally accurate. Consequently, based on only the observable structure and size of the head, I cannot independently verify the visibility and proportional accuracy of the facial features.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the stripes on the shirt maintain consistent width, alignment, and color accuracy across the collar and chest area?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a shirt with colorful stripes that appear consistent in width and alignment across the collar and chest area. The colors of the stripes are vibrant, and there is no noticeable deviation in their pattern or alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the surface of the figure appear smooth and reflective, with no visible texture artifacts or rough edges?",
    "explanation": "The surface of the figure in Image B appears smooth and reflective, characteristic of a polished, plastic-like finish typical of figurine models. There are no visible texture artifacts or rough edges, enhancing the perception of a well-crafted, high-quality surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the background a uniform pastel color with no gradients, shadows, or blending artifacts near the figure's edges?",
    "explanation": "The background of Image B consists of a pastel color scheme. However, it is not uniform as there are visible gradients and changes in color. The blending of colors is smooth, with no sharp shadows or blending artifacts evident near the figure's edges, contributing to a soft and seamless background aesthetic.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the facial expression more animated than the original (e.g., wider eyes, open mouth) but still anatomically consistent and not distorted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial expression details are blurred and thus not visible, preventing a clear assessment of animation, anatomical consistency, or potential distortion of facial features in comparison to the original. Therefore, I cannot draw a definitive conclusion on this aspect.",
    "answer": "No"
