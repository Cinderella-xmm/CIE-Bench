    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the qipao clearly defined with consistent outlines and no broken or distorted petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns are analyzed by examining their outlines and shapes. The petals appear clearly defined, with smooth, consistent outlines and no noticeable breaks or distortions. The cohesion in the design indicates careful attention to detail, typical of well-made embroidered garments.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the jade-patterned clasps align correctly along the central seam and display consistent shape and size without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jade-patterned clasps are observed along the qipao's central seam. They are consistently shaped and symmetrically positioned, maintaining uniformity without signs of deformation. This suggests a meticulous alignment typical of traditional qipao designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the color distribution across the qipao uniform, with no visible banding or abrupt transitions between hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analysis of Image B, the red color of the qipao is consistent without any visible banding or abrupt color transitions. The uniform hue across the garment indicates an even application of color, which is common in high-quality fabric construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the detachable writing sections placed with clean edges and consistent lighting, and do they appear anchored to the garment rather than floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the assorted writing sections appear with clean edges, consistent lighting, and an appropriate placement surrounding the character without interacting with the garment directly. However, they give a floating impression rather than being anchored visually onto the garment itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand show five fingers with normal spacing, natural curvature, and no extra or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of the hand in Image B confirms the presence of five fingers, all with normal spacing and natural curvature. There are no extra or missing digits, indicating accurate and realistic depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all elements of the qipao and added components proportionally balanced and spatially coherent without stretching or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements of the qipao, including the floral patterns and clasps, are proportionate and spatially coherent, showing no evidence of distortion, stretching, or compression. The diminutive writing sections surrounding the character are spatially arranged without affecting the qipao design balance.",
