    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edge of the snow globe smooth and continuous, with no visible seams, distortions, or pixelation along its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edge of the snow globe appears smooth and continuous without any visible seams or distortions. The surface reflects light uniformly, suggesting a well-rendered glass surface typically seen in high-quality images. For this to be realistic, the globe's edge must be seamlessly integrated into the surrounding environment, which seems to be the case here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the reflections and refractions on the snow globe surface consistent with how light behaves on clear glass, showing subtle bending of the scene behind it and soft highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B demonstrates reflections and refractions that are typical of clear glass objects. The scene behind the globe is subtly bent, and the highlights are soft, which is consistent with how light interacts with such surfaces. This is a common characteristic of transparent objects, where light behaves predictably, creating realistic visual effects.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all visible figures inside the snow globe have complete and correctly proportioned limbs, with no extra fingers, missing arms, or distorted postures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures inside the snow globe appear to have complete and correctly proportioned limbs. There are no visible anomalies such as extra fingers, missing arms, or distorted postures, which indicates attention to detail in maintaining realistic human figures within the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the autumn-colored leaves integrated smoothly into the existing green vegetation, with no abrupt color changes or blocky textures indicating digital overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the autumn-colored leaves blend smoothly with the green vegetation, without any abrupt transitions or blocky textures that would suggest a digital overlay. This integration creates a cohesive and natural look, consistent with how foliage changes color gradually in nature during autumn.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the snow particles visible throughout the globe in a dynamic, swirling pattern, and do they not fully cover the Great Wall or figures, allowing them to remain clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow particles within the globe in Image B are arranged in a dynamic, swirling pattern that reflects movement typical of snow globes. They do not obscure significant parts of the scene, as both the Great Wall and the figures remain clearly visible. This arrangement highlights the intended aesthetics of a snow globe without overwhelming the main elements inside it.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the ceramic birds clearly distinguishable as small flying objects with defined wings and bodies, and are they located in the air above the Wall without touching any surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ceramic birds in Image B are distinguishable with defined wings and bodies, suggesting skilled rendering to depict them accurately as flying objects. They are positioned in the air above the Great Wall, without appearing to be in contact with any surfaces, adhering to standard depictions of flight.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the wooden base dark in color, textured with realistic grain, and does it support the snow globe without floating or tilting, with the engraved text clearly legible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base of the snow globe in Image B is dark and shows a realistic wood grain texture. It supports the snow globe properly, appearing stable and not floating or tilting. The text engraved on the base is clearly legible, indicating careful attention to detail in the rendering process, thus keeping with the expectations of product design.",
