    "Question": "Q1: Is the atom illustration placed in the same location as the original dough and does it have a smooth, continuous edge without jagged lines or gaps?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the atom illustration is positioned centrally, resembling the location of the dough in Image A. The illustration appears with smooth, continuous edges without any jagged lines or gaps, likely created digitally with precise tools, contrasting the imperfect edges seen in dough imprints.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the additional atom-shaped cookies the same size as the original dough and do they have colors that blend naturally with the beige dough and wooden background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the additional atom illustrations do not match the size of the original dough present in Image A, being smaller and assorted in size. Furthermore, the bright, varied colors of these illustrations don't naturally blend with the beige dough and wooden background seen in Image A, suggesting digital addition rather than natural physical replication.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the arrows point directly to the correct parts of the atom (electrons, protons, neutrons) without crossing over or distorting the atomic shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arrows seem to connect various illustrations to text, but they do not explicitly reference parts of an atom like electrons, protons, and neutrons. The connections appear arbitrary without depicting accurate atomic theory, suggesting that the arrows and text are more stylistic and not meant for precise scientific identification.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the title text 'Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry' clearly visible, positioned above the illustrations, and does it not overlap with the atom shapes or cookie cutter?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains title text that is not 'Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry,' and instead reads 'Me Thes Flaaikes Uok Hclvies,' which is not clear and coherent. This text also overlaps with some of the illustrations and does not fulfill the criteria mentioned, thus it appears more as a decorative feature rather than clearly positioned and readable text.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the dotted lines straight, uniformly spaced, and positioned between sections without covering the atom illustrations or cookie cutter?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dotted lines are used as borders around the edges. These lines don't intersect the atom illustrations directly but rather frame them, maintaining separation and uniform spacing without overlapping with the atomic shapes or cookie cutter.",
    "answer": "Yes"
