      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D models of the horse and elephant maintain their current pose without any unnatural distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style horse is standing on the elephant's back, similar to Image A but simplified for the 3D model style. This playful pose maintains the balance and proportions consistent with this style, and there are no visible distortions or deformations in the models themselves. The rounded and simplified forms of the chibi model aim to preserve the essence while stylizing the figures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the photorealistic background of the grassy field and sky free from any artifacts or distortions introduced by the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a sky with clouds and a grassy field, resembling a photorealistic style. This matches the lower detail aesthetic but is consistent enough that no unusual artifacts or distortions are apparent. The blending with the chibi models is smooth and does not introduce any visual discrepancies.",

      "question": "Does the ornate photo frame blend naturally with the scene without causing any visual disruption or introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a detailed, ornate photo frame surrounding the scene, designed to complement the chibi models within the frame. The frame has consistent textures without introducing new visual disruptions, maintaining harmony with the stylized scene and enhancing the overall presentation without causing any disruption.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi-style 3D models of the horse and elephant preserved, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style models preserve their proportionately suitable chibi dimensions, with rounded features typical of such designs. The models are correctly scaled, avoiding geometric discrepancies or unnatural proportions. The stylization adheres to typical chibi conventions of exaggerated simplicity yet coherent physical forms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D models retain fine details without any loss or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows simplified chibi models with characteristic designs that forego excessive fine details typical of realistic renderings. The smooth textures and prominent features reflect the chibi aesthetic without losing crucial elements or introducing unnatural textures. This approach conforms to stylization norms, retaining recognizable features.",
