      "question": "Do the simplified versions of the red motorcycle and blue truck maintain their key features without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red motorcycle and blue truck are depicted in a cartoon and simplified style, which inherently reduces detail and texture complexity. This simplification is common in cartoon or sticker designs, aiming for a more playful and accessible representation. The distinctive shapes and colors are preserved, allowing viewers to immediately recognize the vehicles. No unnatural textures or distortions are introduced; the simplification enhances the approachable characteristics of a fun design without intentional distortion.",

      "question": "Does the rider's black gear retain its essential characteristics without unnatural alterations or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rider in Image B is displayed with a simplified black gear, emphasizing the cartoon nature of the sticker design. This style is typical in simplified designs where detailed textures or small details are not necessary for recognizing a person's attire. The central features of the gear, like the black color and protective function suggested by a helmet, are preserved without introducing unrealistic alterations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the playful touches such as exaggerated proportions or expressive characteristics added without breaking the visual credibility or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Playful exaggeration in proportion is common in cartoon designs to convey action, excitement, or personality. In Image B, visual harmony is achieved by balancing simplicity with expressivity. The proportions of the vehicles and the rider are exaggerated in a manner that does not introduce unwelcome artifacts. They maintain visual credibility within their artistic style.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the thick white outline applied consistently around the sticker design without interfering with the clarity of the elements within?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The thick white outline in Image B is applied to define the sticker edges, a commonly used technique to separate elements from backgrounds and enhance visibility. The outline is consistent, allowing the simplified elements within it to remain clear and distinct. This technique aids in creating a cohesive visual design without compromising the elements inside.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the use of a solid flat color for the circular base, with the motorcycle or truck extending beyond it, achieve a dynamic effect without causing visual inconsistencies or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B effectively uses solid flat colors typical in sticker or cartoon designs. This choice in design avoids the risk associated with texture complexity and focuses on dynamic appearance. Although detailed elements are simplified, they remain recognizable and visually consistent with the rest of the design, preserving the essence without losing significance.",
