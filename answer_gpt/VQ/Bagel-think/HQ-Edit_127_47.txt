    "Question": "Q1: Are the trees, mountains, and water inside the glass orb correctly proportioned and undistorted despite the spherical enclosure, with no visible warping or bending of vertical lines?",
    "explanation": "The image within the glass orb appears proportioned and undistorted, as the trees, mountains, and water maintain their natural appearance without significant bend or distortion. When viewed through a spherical surface, objects often appear warped due to refraction, but the image inside the orb seems to have been adjusted to maintain proper perspective and proportions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the ducks retain their natural body shape and size relative to the water and rocks, with smooth, reflective surfaces that do not show exaggerated shine or unnatural specular highlights?",
    "explanation": "The ducks inside the orb maintain their natural body proportions relative to the surrounding water and rocks. Their surfaces do not exhibit any exaggerated shine or specular highlights beyond what is typical for water reflection.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the water beneath the ducks transparent enough to clearly see the rocky bottom, with no visible layering artifacts, texture tiling, or unnatural opacity variations?",
    "explanation": "Inside the orb, the water is sufficiently transparent, allowing for visibility of the rocky bottom without displaying layering artifacts, texture tiling, or unnatural opacity variations. The visual appearance is consistent with clear water that reveals underlying features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the miniature animal figurines positioned on solid surfaces (rocks or ground), properly scaled compared to surrounding elements, and free from floating or unnatural shadows?",
    "explanation": "The miniature animal figurines are positioned on what appear to be solid surfaces within the orb, such as rocks or the ground. Their scale is appropriately adjusted to match the surrounding elements, and they are free from any indication of floating or unnatural shadows that could suggest incorrect placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the wood base have a natural grain pattern and cast a consistent shadow under the orb, indicating physical contact and realistic lighting interaction?",
    "explanation": "The wood base under the orb displays a natural grain pattern and casts a consistent shadow, suggesting physical contact with the orb and interaction with the lighting. This gives the impression of weight and stability, indicating realism in the spotlighting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
