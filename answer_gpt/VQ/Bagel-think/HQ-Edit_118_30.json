      "question": "Are the trainâ€™s locomotive and carriages transformed into interlocking geometric blocks that maintain their original proportions and alignment along the track without visible distortions or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train and its carriages are indeed transformed into interlocking geometric blocks. The shapes are vibrant and colorful, resembling a puzzle with distinct pieces. Despite the stylization into geometric forms, the locomotive and carriages maintain their proportions relative to each other and the track. The blocks appear aligned with the track without any visible distortion or misaligned edges, effectively forming a cohesive and orderly design. The transformations do not disrupt the overall composition and alignment of the train and the track.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the smoke above the train rendered as smooth, continuous swirling white forms that follow the natural trajectory of rising steam without jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smoke is depicted in vibrant, interlocking geometric shapes akin to puzzle pieces. These pieces are designed to mimic the shape and flow of steam but do not form smooth and continuous lines. Instead, the edges are segmental, matching the puzzle-like style of the overall image, diverging from a realistic depiction, which would have featured smooth and whirling edges. Thus, the smoke does not follow a continuous trajectory and includes jagged edges due to the puzzle-pattern transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all human figures at the station platform replaced by small, flat puzzle-shaped elements wearing vintage clothing, with no visible distortions in limbs or posture, and do they retain recognizable positions relative to benches and luggage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures present in Image A have been entirely removed and replaced with puzzle pieces that make up the entirety of the image. There are no depictions of human figures, whether rendered as puzzle pieces or otherwise. Therefore, no puzzle-shaped elements are representing people at the station platform, nor are there positions relative to benches and luggage that can be identified within this transformed context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fields and hills in the background rendered as clearly defined geometric patterns (e.g., rectangles, triangles) that form a cohesive, interlocking design without gaps, overlapping errors, or abrupt texture changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background fields and hills are represented using a mosaic of distinct geometric shapes, such as rectangles, squares, and other interlocking pieces, creating a puzzle-like appearance across the scene. These shapes interlock seamlessly without evident gaps, overlapping errors, or abrupt texture changes, contributing to a uniform and integrated design throughout the composition. This transformation maintains a sense of continuity and artistry, avoiding disruptions in the visual flow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene, including the train, tracks, station, and landscape, placed on a light wooden tabletop with visible wood grain and consistent lighting, and are there no floating elements or mismatched shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the entire scene as a puzzle laid on a light wooden tabletop. The wood grain is visibly consistent across the background, which serves as the base or 'frame' for the puzzle that comprises the train, tracks, station, and landscape. This framing suggests the intention to stylize the scene as a puzzle. There are no floating elements or mismatched shadows around the puzzle pieces, supporting a cohesive presentation with consistent lighting and a grounded layout on the tabletop.",
