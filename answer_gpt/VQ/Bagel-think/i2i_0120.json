      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine of the character, which resembles a Pokémon named Bulbasaur, has a texture consistent with a soft vinyl material typically used for figures and toys. The surface appears smooth and reflects light uniformly, without any unexpected or unnatural artifacts that would suggest an inconsistency in material or texture. This suggests that the textural elements are well-integrated and appear realistic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green plants in Image B fit naturally into the scene, matching the overall color scheme and lighting conditions.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tea utensils, which include cups and potentially a teapot, are appropriately sized in comparison to the figurine and the table itself. They maintain a realistic scale that fits the overall design of a coffee or tea setup. Their positioning around the figurine complements the scene, allowing each element to have its distinct space while contributing to a harmonious composition.",
