      "question": "Does the claymation texture applied to the cocktail glass maintain its structural coherence without introducing unnatural textures or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cocktail glass is rendered in a claymation style, characterized by a smooth, matte look typical of clay models. The original glass texture from Image A is not preserved. Claymation uses rounded forms, and while the glass maintains a general cylindrical shape, it lacks the reflective and transparent qualities of glass seen in Image A. Instead, it has uniformity in texture suitable for clay, losing the intricate glass details. Therefore, while the structure holds, the fine details typical of glassware are absent.",

      "question": "Do the ice cubes and liquid in the cocktail retain their visual plausibility and natural appearance after being converted into a claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ice cubes in Image B are transformed into rounded, smooth shapes typical of clay objects, losing their transparent and angular appearance from Image A. The liquid, originally amber and reflective, is homogenized into a monotone clay surface, which does not suggest liquid properties. Therefore, the claymation style does not maintain the original plausibility and recognizable features of ice cubes and liquid.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the lime slice and straw preserved without distortion in the claymation design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime slice and straw maintain their essential geometric shapes: the lime remains crescent-shaped, and the straw is cylindrical. Comparing with Image A, although the textures and materials are transformed into the smooth, uniform surface typical of claymation, their basic shapes are preserved without any noticeable distortion or alteration of proportions.",

      "question": "Does the background, including the bar counter and bottles, retain its structural integrity and visual coherence without introducing unnatural artifacts in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is significantly altered. The bar counter and bottles lose their realistic features and intricate detailing, transformed into simplified, rounded, and abstract clay shapes. The details that define each bottle and the texture of the counter in Image A are lost, introducing a stylized, abstract representation typical of claymation, which does not retain realistic coherence and introduces artificial-looking objects.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the cocktail glass, napkin, and surrounding objects logically consistent in the claymation design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions mostly appear consistent, with the cocktail glass, napkin, and their spatial relationships relatively preserved. Although the objects are rendered in a simplistic claymation style, their placement and scale compared to one another resemble those in Image A, indicating logical consistency. However, the simplified look alters their realistic interaction slightly but does not disrupt their fundamental physical relationships.",
