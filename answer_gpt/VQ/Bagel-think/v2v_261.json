      "question": "Does the miniature beach and surfer figure inside the snow globe appear structurally consistent and visually credible compared to the original beach scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe contains a miniature beach scene with a surfer figure. The design is stylized to have a chibi and cartoonish appearance, which typically features exaggerated features like a larger head and simplified anatomy. Despite this artistic style, the scene inside the snow globe mimics the elements from Image A, including the surfer's pose waxing the surfboard and the sunset in the background. This conveys structural consistency in a creative manner, maintaining the overall theme of the original beach scene.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the hands of the chibi-style 3D surfer figure free of unnatural textures and maintain the correct number of fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure inside the snow globe appears to be rendered in a chibi style, which often simplifies and exaggerates certain aspects while maintaining essential features like the correct number of fingers. The hands, though simplified, do not appear to have unnatural textures, and it looks like they maintain the correct number of fingers typical for such artistic renditions. The stylized nature is intentional and thus not unnatural for this art form.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the soft golden light and sparkles scattered around the snow globe create a natural and plausible warm atmosphere without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a snow globe with a warm glow reflecting a sunset-like atmosphere, similar to Image A. The sparkles around the snow globe are typical in portraying a whimsical and fantastical scene. The lighting appears smooth and consistent with the intended warm ambiance due to a fireplace being nearby, enhancing the coziness without showing visible artifacts that would break the illusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the miniature surfer figure and surfboard remain intact and undistorted within the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Image B figure and surfboard maintain their intended geometric shapes even when reduced to a stylized form within the snow globe. The miniature figure holds the surfboard in a manner consistent with the original scene from Image A, preserving the integrity of key features and shapes—such as limbs and the surfboard—which are both recognizable and structurally sound in this style.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the placement of the snow globe on the wooden shelf near the fireplace visually credible and proportionally realistic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe is placed on a wooden shelf close to a fireplace which is visually plausible. The proportions between the snow globe, the shelf, and the background elements like the fireplace are reasonable and suggest an indoor setting that naturally could host such decorations. Nothing appears out of scale or illogical, suggesting a realistic placement within the context of the image.",
