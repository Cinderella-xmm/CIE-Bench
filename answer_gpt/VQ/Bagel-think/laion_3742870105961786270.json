      "question": "Does the converted jug appear as a translucent glass stopper with visible reflections and refractions, and is it properly aligned with the bottle’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jug from the statue has been transformed into a glass stopper for a bottle. It features visible reflections and refractions typical of glass, indicating transparency. It is positioned on top of the bottle, aligning correctly with the neck, reflecting a meticulous integration into the new context as a bottle stopper. This transformation shows an understanding of how glass objects should visually interact with light.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The goose from Image A is incorporated into the base of the bottle in Image B. It is connected at a visible point at the bottom, appearing as part of the bottle's design. The size is proportional, neither overly large nor small relative to the bottle. Its features remain stylized yet recognizable as a goose, maintaining the artistic intent.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows grapevine engravings following the smooth surface of the bottle. These engravings are sharply defined, with even line thickness, creating an elegant decoration on the bottle. They exhibit precise craftsmanship that matches the bottle's curvature without any jagged edges.",
