        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the items arranged in a way that does not compromise the coherence of the scene. The pancakes, berries, bread, and flower vase fit well into the overall composition, as they are placed naturally on the table and do not appear to be out of place or awkwardly inserted. The visual cues in Image B indicate a harmonious incorporation that does not disrupt the flow or structure of the setting.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures of the food items and the vase are depicted with sufficient detail. The pancakes and bread show realistic textures with golden-brown hues and crispy surfaces. The berries are vivid and round, capturing their natural appearance, while the flower vase has a simple yet distinct texture. There are no visible artifacts or unnatural elements detracting from their appearances.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depicted lighting and shadow are consistent with the light source visible through the window. The way shadows fall on the pancakes, berries, bread, and vase matches the direction of natural light casting from the window, suggesting a coherent integration with the established lighting of the scene.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all items—the pancakes, berries, bread, and flower vase—are appropriately proportioned and logically placed considering the scene's spatial arrangement. The items appear to be true to scale in relation to one another and the table, with sensible placements that do not overshadow each other or seem implausible as part of a breakfast setup.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the subject holding the coffee cup are shown with a natural pose. The fingers are curved around the cup in a relaxed manner, revealing realistic hand anatomy and grip without signs of distortion or awkward positioning, thus maintaining naturalness.",
