    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal facets on the truck's cabin and body uniformly shaped and aligned with the original panel lines, without visible breaks or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck cabin and body features facets created from translucent green material resembling those used in constructing items made from crystal. These facets appear to mirror the panel lines of what one might expect given the structured cabin and body panels on vehicles. Since crystal materials typically have well-defined, consistent edges unless purposefully chipped or broken, the visual depiction suggests a deliberate design reflecting these qualities without any visible misalignment or breaks compared to standard panel designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the transparent quartz wheels maintain the same size, spacing, and axle alignment as the original muddy wheels, with no floating or misplaced components?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels of the crystal truck appear translucent and maintain uniformity in size compared to typical truck standards, showing spacing that suggests proper alignment on an axle. The visible portrayal in Image B shows them attached in a manner that does not indicate any floating or misplacement, thereby appearing consistent with the position and alignment as seen in standard vehicle imagery.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the quartz wheels internally detailed with natural-looking crystal lattice structures that follow the shape of the original hubs and rims, without jagged or inconsistent lines?",
    "explanation": "The wheels in Image B are depicted as having a translucent quartz appearance, which typically includes internal lattice structures found in natural crystals. The visuals portray these lattice structures in the wheels' internal detailing as being smooth and consistent, following the curved cylindrical shape, indicative of a natural progression seen in quartz. There are no indications of jagged or inconsistent lines breaking the natural flow visualized in crystal materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the white marble platform flat, continuous, and properly supporting the entire underside of the crystal truck, with no visible gaps or floating sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is positioned atop a white marble platform that appears completely flat and continuous. The entire base structure forms a supportive platform on which the truck rests, showing no signs of gaps or sections hovering, suggesting a direct contact fully supporting its underside, consistent with how flat marble surfaces typically interact with objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the crystal surfaces display subtle color refraction and reflections consistent with emerald and jade materials, without unnatural glowing patches or excessive chromatic aberration?",
    "explanation": "The surfaces in Image B display a green tint that reflects the characteristics seen in crystal materials, notably emerald or jade. The crystal surfaces, while presenting color refraction and reflections typical of these materials, do so subtly without the appearance of unnatural glowing or marked chromatic aberrations, common issues when rendering such materials visually.",
    "answer": "Yes"
