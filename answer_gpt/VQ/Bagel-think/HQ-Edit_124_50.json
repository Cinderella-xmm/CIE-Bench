      "question": "Are the puzzle sections on the horseâ€™s body clearly defined with clean, interlocking edges that follow the natural curves of the horse's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse figure features puzzle sections that are intended to fit together across the curves of the horse. Upon examining the image, the edges of the puzzle pieces are noticeable, but they do not appear to interlock in a way that is typical for a jigsaw puzzle. Instead, they seem to be more symbolic or decorative, not strictly following the horse's natural form or providing a clear interlocking pattern. Considering puzzle conventions, the appearance lacks the precise definition usually associated with puzzle pieces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the floral patterns on each puzzle section align seamlessly at the edges where pieces meet, maintaining visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the floral patterns do not align perfectly across the sections. This misalignment suggests that the puzzle pieces are not designed to connect seamlessly with precise continuation of patterns. Generally, well-integrated patterns across puzzle sections maintain continuity at edges, but here, the visual does not reflect such an alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass dome over the horse clear and free from unnatural distortions, smudges, or irregular reflections that would suggest poor material simulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome covering the horse appears smooth and clear. The reflections and light interactions on its surface look consistent with high-quality glass. There are no visible distortions or smudges that indicate poor simulation, suggesting the dome is well-rendered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wooden base exhibit realistic wood grain and texture, and is the compass embedded in a way that matches the surface plane and scale of the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows that the wooden base has a detailed texture and wood grain that looks realistic. The embedded compass matches the scale of the base and appears to be integrated into the surface plane properly. Both characteristics indicate a quality rendering that adheres to realistic aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the antique-brass accents positioned logically on the frame and base, with a matte-to-slight-reflective finish consistent with aged metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the antique-brass accents are positioned logically and sensibly on the horse's display, including on the frame and around the base. These accents exhibit a finish that transitions from matte to slightly reflective, replicating the typical appearance of aged metal accurately, showcasing consistency in the material portrayal.",
