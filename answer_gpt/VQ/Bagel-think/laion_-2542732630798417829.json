    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and smile drawn on the glass surface without causing visible distortion or blocking of the internal filament structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in question appears as a character with a face on what resembles a glass bulb. However, the object is actually part of a comic strip design rather than a realistic depiction. Consequently, there are no additional eyes and smile drawn on the glass surface of the bulb structure as the elements used differentiate as character features in a comic style rather than the object's surface application. This consideration clarifies there's no interaction affecting the internal filament structure such as drawn features distorting visibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the arms extend from the bulb body in a way that follows the curvature of the glass and metal cage without appearing detached or geometrically broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the comic panel of Image B, the bulb does not have arms extending from its body. The visual design focuses on various machine concepts around the bulb with focused light instead. No depiction of arms is present to follow any curvature or structural logic, indicating they neither appear detached nor geometrically broken.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the metal cage fully intact with all loops connected and symmetrically arranged around the bulb, showing no missing or distorted sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the representation of the bulb shows a clear intact metal cage with all loops symmetrically arranged around the bulb. The comic's art style maintains clear and connected structural elements to ensure realism within the stylized depiction. This structured visual continuity ensures no distortions or missing sections are present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the background elements cast shadows and reflect light in a manner consistent with the direction and intensity of the bulb’s glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, background elements of the cartoonish machine illustrations imply a luminous bulb but without depicting consistent shadow or reflective behavior based on the glowing bulb's illustrated position. Shadows and highlights do not conform to realistic light behavior customary in comic art, focusing on theme and stylization over precise shadow casting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors applied evenly across all surfaces (glass, metal, background) without visible banding, oversaturation, or texture degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors within Image B, being stylized in a comic art manner, maintain a deliberate choice in saturation and application to fit the aesthetic. They are uniformly applied across different surfaces, ensuring seamless integration without banding or texture degradation, typical of quality graphical artwork in comic design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the text box and speech bubble positioned so that they do not overlap with the bulb’s internal structure or metal cage, and are they clearly readable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is presented within a text box, distinct from speech bubbles, maintaining a separate position that does not overlap with the bulb's structure or metal cage. However, text readability must be accounted as stylized script does not adhere to direct readability standards, yet no structural overlap is noticed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the arms positioned in a way that follows natural joint angles and does not intersect with the bulb’s glass or metal cage in an impossible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any arms on the bulb itself. In the comic strip's context, no arms protrude from the bulb or engage in interaction with its glass or metal cage. Therefore, there's no requirement to assess anatomical correctness or interaction consistency for non-existent elements.",
