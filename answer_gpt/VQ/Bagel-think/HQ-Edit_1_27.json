      "question": "Is the Eiffel Towerâ€™s structure preserved with accurate proportions and no geometric distortions despite being scaled down?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is enclosed within a glass dome, designed to resemble a miniature version of the iconic structure. The visual cues indicate that the proportions of the tower are proportionate, and it aligns with common knowledge of its design. The details and patterns match the original architecture, suggesting no apparent geometric distortions despite the scale.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a clear, seamless glass dome structure above the scene that fully encloses it without intersecting or distorting any elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible glass dome that is well-shaped and enclosed around the entire scene. It is seamless with no interruptions or intersections with the other elements. This observation can be inferred from the clarity and smoothness of the glass's surface and its perfect enclosure over the miniature scene.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the snow cover on the ground, trees, and lampposts appear uniformly powdery and free of clumping or artificial texture patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow cover in Image B appears to be evenly distributed across the ground, trees, and lampposts. With a visual examination, it seems to possess a consistent, powdery texture without artificial bumps or clumping effects visible. This uniform appearance reflects a realistic portrayal of snow cover when compared to actual snow accumulation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all human figures proportionally small, anatomically correct (including hands with no more than five fingers), and posed in natural stances without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures are scaled to be small to fit inside the glass dome alongside the Eiffel Tower. Their anatomical features appear correct, maintaining real-world proportions and naturally posed stances without visible distortions or unnatural posing despite the miniature scale.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the streetlamps emit a faint, diffused glow without bright halos or overexposed areas, and are they aligned along the pathway as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The streetlamps in Image B emit a soft and diffused glow, which is observed through the light's subtle presence without any glaring halos or overexposure. They appear to be aligned neatly along the pathway, mirroring the arrangement from Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are cobblestone textures visibly embedded beneath the snow along the pathways, showing consistent patterns and fine detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pathways display cobblestone textures that are visible beneath the thin snow layer. They are portrayed with fine detail and consistent pattern, which suggests a realistic depiction of cobblestones despite snow coverage, indicating precision in texture representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the tree branches thin, naturally branched, and lightly dusted with snow without sagging or unnatural accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree branches in Image B are observed to be thin and naturally branched, with a light dusting of snow. This portrayal reflects realistic tree branch characteristics without heavy sagging or unnatural snow accumulation, conveying a natural winter scene within the dome.",
