      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the LEGO version of the military ship maintain its original shape and structural proportions without visible distortions or misaligned brick patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO military ship appears to be constructed accurately with regard to shape and proportions. The brick patterns are aligned and do not show visible distortions. The model accurately mimics the structure of a military ship using LEGO pieces, which typically have blocky yet organized structures. This shows the builder's effort in keeping proportions close to the real object.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the LEGO-rendered ocean waves shaped in a way that mimics natural wave motion, without appearing overly rigid or uniformly flat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ocean waves created with LEGO bricks in Image B indeed appear uniform and rigid, lacking the variability and curvature typical of natural ocean waves. LEGO bricks inherently create a pixelated, structured surface when assembled for larger block areas like ocean waves.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the LEGO accessories used for the boat deck properly scaled and positioned to match the size and perspective of the character and the surrounding scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the LEGO representation, accessories like handles are well-scaled relative to the character and the surrounding LEGO environment. They reflect typical LEGO design principles where components are proportionally scaled to fit standard minifigure and object dimensions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the LEGO-textured life vest and shirt retain their original colors and show no signs of unnatural texture repetition, pixelation, or mismatched edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The life vest and shirt colors in Image B remain true to the LEGO design, with consistent texture and color blocks that lack pixelation or mismatched edges. LEGO pieces are designed to have defined edges and consistent colors, maintaining a cohesive appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO model positioned on a shelf that appears structurally sound and spatially coherent, with appropriate shadows and depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO model is indeed positioned on a shelf, as indicated by the background and positioning within a confined space. The shadows and depth provide clear cues that suggest that the shelf and positioning are stable and spatially coherent in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, misaligned bricks, or missing pieces in the LEGO model that break the illusion of a cohesive construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cohesive LEGO construction without visible artifacts like jagged lines or misaligned bricks. The assembly appears complete and well-structured typical of a well-built LEGO model without missing pieces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
