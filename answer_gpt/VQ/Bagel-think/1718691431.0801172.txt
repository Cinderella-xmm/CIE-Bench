    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features of the fox mask (eyes, nose, mouth) aligned symmetrically and proportionally, without any stretched or deformed areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the fox mask including the eyes, nose, and mouth appear to be symmetrically aligned with well-defined proportions, which are typical for stylized or artistic renditions. My analysis shows that the mask’s design maintains a balanced and proportional layout, indicating a deliberate, symmetrical arrangement without stretch or deformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the floral patterns on the kimono replaced with clean, geometric motifs that follow consistent lines and shapes, without blurred or fragmented edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono features geometric motifs replacing the original floral patterns. These geometric shapes follow consistent lines and have defined edges, reflecting a clean design devoid of any blurred or fragmented edges. This indicates a purposeful artistic transition from organic to geometric design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Do the colors on the kimono and mask transition smoothly between deep reds, pale pinks, and metallic tones without visible color bleeding or inconsistent shading?",
    "explanation": "Image B exhibits a color palette that transitions smoothly between deep reds and pale tones—particularly on the kimono—without traces of color bleeding or inconsistent shading. Unlike the broader tonal range observed in Image A, Image B maintains a controlled palette for visual coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the kimono retain a natural drape and fold structure, with no unnatural flattening or stretching of fabric that would disrupt physical plausibility?",
    "explanation": "Image B’s representation adopts a stylized, two-dimensional form, as observed in abstract or artistic interpretations, thus losing the natural drape and fold structure that would align with physical realism seen in Image A’s photographic depiction of fabric.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the surfaces of the fox mask and kimono free from jagged edges, pixelation, or texture seams that suggest incomplete rendering or editing errors?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases clean surfaces on both the fox mask and kimono without jagged edges, pixelation, or visible texture seams. This indicates a well-rendered completion of the geometric and stylized design without any evident editing errors.",
    "answer": "Yes"
