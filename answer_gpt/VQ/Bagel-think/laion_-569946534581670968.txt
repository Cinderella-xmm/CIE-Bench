    "Question": "Q1: Do the plush toy versions of the chicken wings retain the correct anatomical shape and proportions of real wings, such as the joint areas and wing tips, without deformation or unnatural stretching?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy versions of the chicken wings are made of a textile material, lacking the anatomical details like joints and wing tips present in real chicken wings. These plush wings are simple, rounded in shape, and do not exhibit the natural indentations and protrusions found in actual wings. This suggests a departure from the real anatomy and proportions seen in Image A.",
