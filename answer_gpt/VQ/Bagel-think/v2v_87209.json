      "question": "Do the sinuous lines and botanical motifs on the owls appear smooth and integrated without any broken geometric shapes or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Art Nouveau style is characterized by flowing, sinuous lines and nature-inspired motifs. The owls are depicted with such curvilinear lines and botanical embellishments, which are typically smooth and integrated. There are no visible broken geometric shapes or textures that appear unnatural within this style, indicating a cohesive design consistent with Art Nouveau principles.",

      "question": "Is the 'Owlegories' typography in whiplash script legible and harmoniously integrated into the design without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Owlegories' typography is styled in a manner consistent with the Art Nouveau aesthetic, featuring playful lettering, but it remains legible and fits within the overall design theme. The typography, while stylized, does not appear disjointed or out of place, maintaining harmony with other design elements.",

      "question": "Does the background with organic, curvilinear patterns complement the main elements without causing any visual clutter or unnatural disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features organic, swirling patterns typical of Art Nouveau art. These patterns enhance the main elements by providing a decorative backdrop that aligns with the style's conventions. The patterns seem to complement the foreground elements without overwhelming them or introducing visual clutter, creating a balanced and aesthetically pleasing composition.",

      "question": "Is the 'SHOP NOW' button clearly visible yet delicately integrated into the Art Nouveau design without appearing jarring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'SHOP NOW' button does not appear, as the design has been altered to a more artful style, perhaps to fit an Art Nouveau theme. Any integration of such elements should be consistent with the style. Since Image B does not feature the button, its integration cannot be assessed.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the DVD case and CD consistent and visually credible within the new Art Nouveau style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions and shapes of the DVD case and CD adhere to conventional forms despite the Art Nouveau embellishments. The stylized elements added to the design maintain the standard shapes of the original objects (as seen in Image A), indicating that their proportions are credible and fit naturally within the context of the Art Nouveau style.",
