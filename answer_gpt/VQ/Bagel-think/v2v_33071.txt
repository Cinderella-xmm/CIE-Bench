    "Question": "Q1: Does the snow on the clock tower appear naturally accumulated without disrupting the structural integrity of the tower?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow is distributed in areas where snow would typically accumulate, such as along the edges of the roof, the tops of the railings, and corners. This suggests natural snow accumulation patterns. The snow does not appear to weigh down or alter the structure itself, implying that the structural integrity is retained. Since nothing in the image suggests distortion or collapse due to snow weight, it indicates a credible application of snow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the icy patterns on the flags visually credible and detailed, without introducing unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the flags have snow on the top edges, appearing as if it has rested there due to wind exposure and natural settlement. The presence of snow on flags is a realistic occurrence, especially if the environment is cold enough. The snow follows the lead of fabric folds, appearing light and fluffy, consistent with how snow behaves on soft, draped surfaces, indicating no unnatural textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the materials and textures of the clock tower retain their natural appearance despite the added snow?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower's structure and surface textures, such as the color and architectural features, remain visible and consistent with those expected in architectural designs. The snow covers parts of the structure but does not obscure its intrinsic material designs, retaining its original appearance under snow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the geometric shapes of the clock face and tower preserved without distortion or damage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the circular clock face retains its perfect roundness and distinct Roman numerals, and the tower's angular lines remain sharp and intact. These features are untouched by the added snow, indicating that the geometrical shapes have been preserved with fidelity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the fine details of the clock tower and flags been preserved without any loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the intricate details of the tower, such as the railing patterns and window shutters, as well as the fabric folds in the flags, are clearly visible. The snow addition does not cover or distort these details. There is no presence of digital artifacts or unusual textures, suggesting the fine details are faithfully preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"
