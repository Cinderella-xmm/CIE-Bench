      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the bananas retain a natural curvature and texture, avoiding any obvious distortion or unnatural shapes after being redrawn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas are drawn with a smooth, consistent curve, similar to their natural shape. The redraw does maintain a recognizable banana form, even though it's simplified to fit a cartoonish aesthetic. This suggests that the natural curvature is preserved despite the stylization.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the wooden base and metal stand preserve their material properties and structural coherence, without introducing unnatural textures or breaking geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the base and stand with clean lines that represent wood and metal, simplified for a cartoon-like representation. The items maintain their geometric shapes with no visual disruptions, suggesting that the material properties and structural integrity are preserved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bold outlines around the bananas and stand clear and consistent, contributing to the chibi-style aesthetic without being overly thick or uneven?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines around the bananas and the stand are thick and bold, which is typical of a chibi or cartoon style. They are consistent in thickness, contributing to the aesthetic of the illustration without being excessively thick or irregular.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the green hill background integrate seamlessly with the foreground elements, maintaining proportional logic and visual coherence without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a simple green hill and blue sky with clouds as the background, which is consistent with a cartoon style landscape. These elements are proportional in relation to the foreground bananas and stand, contributing to a cohesive scene that integrates well stylistically.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details on the bananas, such as the tips and edges, been preserved in the cartoon redraw, avoiding any loss or distortion that affects the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas are rendered without detailed textures as part of the cartoon style. While fine details like shades and realistic textures are absent, the general shape and silhouette are maintained. The lack of realism is intentional and part of the style, not a distortion.",
