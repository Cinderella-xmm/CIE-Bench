    "Question": "Q1: Are the newly added mission control elements (such as consoles, screens, or panels) geometrically consistent with the room's perspective and do not appear to float or clip through surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible added mission control elements such as consoles, screens, or panels that could potentially conflict with the room's perspective. The visual aspect of the image primarily revolves around an astronaut in a suit and infographics, which do not involve room elements that could be out of place.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the color-coded sections for training stages (e.g., Physical Training, Technical Skills) have clean edges and are they positioned so they do not overlap or obscure the astronaut’s suit or feet?",
    "explanation": "The color-coded sections seen in Image B have clean edges and do not obscure or overlap the astronaut’s suit or feet. The design layout is managed such that all elements are distinct and the infographic does not interfere with the astronaut's depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the illustrative icons (e.g., treadmill, simulator) proportionally sized and placed at appropriate distances from the astronaut so they do not appear oversized or misplaced in the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the icons are adequately sized relative to the astronaut and placed at an appropriate distance in the infographic section to ensure they do not appear intrusive or disproportionate. The icons harmoniously fit with their respective categories without overshadowing or misplacing the visual balance of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the explanatory text for each training stage clearly readable, properly aligned, and not overlapping with the astronaut’s body or suit components?",
    "explanation": "The explanatory text in Image B is legible, well-aligned, and does not overlap with the astronaut's components. The text is placed to one side within the infographic space, providing clear instructions without affecting the visual integrity of the astronaut’s presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the astronaut’s suit joints (e.g., elbows, knees), gloves, and helmet fully intact with no visible distortion, warping, or missing texture details?",
    "explanation": "The astronaut’s suit in Image B, despite being integrated into an edited infographic, retains its integrity with no visible distortion, warping, or missing details. The suit, including its joints, gloves, and helmet, remains consistent with its expected structure and texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the shadows cast by the added mission control elements (e.g., consoles, icons) align with the direction of the original ceiling lighting and do not contradict the existing shadow patterns on the floor and astronaut?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the infographic elements incorporated do not cast shadows that would conflict with any original or additional lighting directions in the scene. There are no added mission control elements like consoles, and the interface elements used do not generate shadows, preserving consistency with existing lighting and shadows.",
    "answer": "Yes"
