      "question": "Does the brushstroke effect cover the figure evenly without disrupting the outline of limbs, head, or torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brushstroke effect is applied to the background and the overall aesthetic but not directly onto the figure. The gymnast is clear and the brushstroke background adds artistic flair without interfering with the clear outline of limbs, head, or torso. This indicates the brushstroke effect is used artistically to emphasize rather than obscure any part of the figure.",

      "question": "Are the enlarged hands anatomically accurate with five fingers each, and do they maintain natural joint alignment and skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands appear anatomically accurate, showing natural joint alignment and a realistic depiction of skin texture. Although pronounced for emphasis, they maintain five fingers each and appear to be realistically rendered without distortion or anatomical anomalies.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs of the gymnast are depicted in an acrobatic position that suggests fluidity and grace. The legs form a continuous curve from hips to feet, indicative of a natural acrobatic pose. There are no sudden or unnatural bends disrupting the intended continuity of the form.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue and silver gradients are applied to both the leotard and skin, blending smoothly to create a visually appealing effect. The colors transition seamlessly without visible banding or unnatural highlights, preserving the intended aesthetic and remaining consistent across the figure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swirling ribbons and stars are strategically placed to enhance the dynamic feel of the image. They follow the direction of movement, complementing the gymnast's pose while ensuring they do not cross or interfere with the figure or the beam. This placement maintains the integrity of the gymnast's form and the artistic composition.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a matt-finish panel with rounded corners as a feature around the image. The editing focuses on the figure, background, and artistic elements, indicating that there is no additional panel or border visible which might cut off any part of the gymnast or background.",
