      "question": "Are the colors of the salad, milk carton, chicken parmesan, and oranges enhanced in a way that appears natural and free from obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the salad appear overly vibrant, especially the greens, creating an unnatural look. The milk carton has a very pronounced and saturated color, which doesn't seem realistic. The chicken parmesan's cheese is starkly bright, lacking natural shading. The oranges appear too intense compared to natural fruit coloration. Such enhancements often introduce an artificial appearance, suggesting that the color enhancement is not natural and has introduced artifacts, perhaps due to excessive contrast or saturation adjustments. In contrast, Image A shows more realistic, subdued colors which are less likely to have such issues.",

      "question": "Does the added title \"Today’s Balanced Lunch\" blend naturally into the image without breaking the structural consistency or introducing any distorted elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lettering at the top reads 'CHTOLER UE OWTBEE DETY,' which does not resemble coherent text and seems like a jumbled arrangement of characters. This breaks continuity and introduces distorted elements that impact the image’s structural consistency. The text appears to be superimposed rather than organically integrated, highlighting its artificiality. A comparison to natural, purposeful typography, likely present in an unedited version, like Image A, would reveal this inconsistency even further.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the white outlines applied to the edges of the plate, food items, and text enhance the visual clarity without creating unnatural textures or degrading fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are exaggerated white outlines around various elements such as the plate and food items. These outlines are too thick and stark, creating an unnatural separation between objects and the background, and causing a loss of fine detail. This kind of alteration tends to degrade the visual texture, making the elements look more like cut-outs than real objects. Image A likely does not have these intrusive outlines, allowing for more natural integration and better preservation of detail.",

      "question": "Is the placeholder for the school logo placed at the bottom right corner with appropriate size and proportion, ensuring it fits naturally within the layout without disrupting the overall balance of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there appears to be an element resembling a placeholder at the bottom left, not at the bottom right as suggested. It looks like it contains the text 'Ghtldhom Xtapmxs,' which seems to be random text without any clear logo depiction. This placement and size disrupt the balance of the image, as it draws attention away from the main elements and doesn't fit naturally with the overall aesthetic. In contrast, any standard logo in an original image like Image A would be proportionate and discrete.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the image been resized and formatted for an A4 vertical layout in a manner that preserves the natural proportions and structural consistency of the plate, food items, and text elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to be formatted in a way that introduces a border resembling a frame around the main elements. This framing does not correspond to a typical A4 vertical layout, which would extend the subject vertically rather than adding such a boxed effect. It has likely altered the natural proportions, making objects, particularly the text and milk carton, appear cramped, impacting structural consistency. In an A4 layout, we would expect the content to be more evenly distributed and the image to maintain the original proportions observed in Image A.",
