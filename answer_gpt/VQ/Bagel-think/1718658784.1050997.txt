    "Question": "Q1: Does the cake’s icing display bold, graphic patterns that are evenly distributed and free from distorted textures or broken lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is depicted with bold colors that cover the entire cake but lack detailed textures such as those typical of icing. Instead, there is a solid color block representing the cake, indicating a shift to a more graphic interpretation. The bold, graphic pattern allocation simplifies the design but doesn't show the distributed pattern detail that icing typically has. This simplification can be seen as not conforming to a typical icing appearance by lacking the defined texture and details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the balloons represented as uniform monochrome dots that maintain their original spherical form and clustered grouping without geometric distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the balloons are transformed into large, solid color shapes. They retain their general spherical form and appear tightly grouped together, consistent with their placement in Image A. The colors of individual balloons are distinct, and their clustered pattern is maintained, but being uniform monochrome provides a flat graphic appearance without nuanced shading or texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Have the table and vase been converted into solid, contrasting color blocks with sharp, clean edges and no residual textures or blending artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the table and vase are shown as solid color blocks. The vase is in a blue color, and the table is yellow, with both lacking any textural details. The edges are sharp and clean, indicating a clear and deliberate graphic style conversion from the more texture-rich and nuanced forms seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the candle flame feature exaggerated sharp lines and bright hues while remaining attached to the wick and showing an upward directional flow without floating or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the candle flame, similar to other elements, is depicted with a graphic aesthetic, primarily in a bright color that lacks any detailed flame textures or shading. The shape is simple and sits directly on top of the candle, indicating no misalignment, maintaining an upward directional flow that mimics typical flame behavior even in its simplified form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all edited elements positioned consistently within the scene’s depth and perspective, with no floating or misplaced components relative to the table and background?",
    "explanation": "In the edited Image B, although the objects are transformed into solid color blocks with bold and simplified designs, they remain consistent in their relative positioning within the scene’s depth. Balloons, cake, and other elements are located in positions that align with their spatial relationships as seen in Image A, displaying no floating or misplaced occurrences relative to the table or background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
