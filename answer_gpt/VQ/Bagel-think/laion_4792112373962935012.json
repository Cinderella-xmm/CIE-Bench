      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the lime wedge retain its natural green hue and textured rind, with no visible distortion or pixelation, even after being shaped into a smiling cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime wedge is visible near the top of the glass. It maintains its natural green hue and textured rind, but the image manipulation to fit the party theme did not distort or pixelate the lime; however, there is an overlay of features making the lime appear as part of a smiling face. Despite the changes, it retains its original visual characteristics of texture and color.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two ice cubes positioned as eyes clearly defined as solid, translucent cubes with sharp edges and no deformation, and do they sit naturally within the liquid without appearing to float unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ice cubes are designed to mimic eyes. They appear to lose their sharp cube edges due to the overlay of stylized eyes, failing to maintain the solidity and realistic positioning within the liquid seen in unedited contexts. The cartoonish eyes affect their natural appearance by overlaying visual elements.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the sugar rim along the glass edge uniformly granular and continuous, with no visible breaks, smearing, or artificial coloring that disrupts the natural appearance of salt/sugar crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rim appears disrupted and altered with colors and designs consistent with the party theme, impacting the natural granular continuity and introducing artificial elements that obscure the natural texture found in sugar or salt rims.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sombrero and maracas have consistent material textures (e.g., woven straw, wood grain, reflective beads), correct scale relative to the glass, and proper shadows that match the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sombrero and maracas in Image B are stylistic additions with cartoonish textures instead of realistic ones. They don’t align well in scale or design consistency with the physical glass and lack the necessary shadows that would match real-world lighting directions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the confetti pieces varied in color and shape, with soft edges and subtle shadows, and do they appear to lie on the surface without floating or overlapping unrealistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the confetti pieces are diverse in color and shape, but they have sharp edges and appear visually unrealistic, as their placement doesn't convincingly appear on a surface. They also seem to float within the edited elements rather than lie naturally.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the text “Fiesta Time!” clearly visible, evenly spaced, and positioned at the top of the image without overlapping or distorting other elements, and does it have consistent stroke width and anti-aliasing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text “Fiesta Time!” in Image B is prominent and clear with vibrant color and playful font. It is positioned at the top without overlapping the glass or other image elements, maintaining consistent stroke width and sufficient anti-aliasing for visual coherency.",
