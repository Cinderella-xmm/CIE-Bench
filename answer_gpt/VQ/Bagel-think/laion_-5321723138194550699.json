    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the black ink outlines around the car's body, wheels, and wing consistently sharp and aligned with the underlying shapes without breaking or overlapping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car's body, wheels, and wing are outlined with bold black ink, typical of a comic-style rendering. The outlines are consistent, following the shape of the car closely. The lines are sharp, well-aligned with the car’s structure, and do not have breaks or overlaps. This reflects an intentional design choice to enhance the visual clarity in this illustration style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the halftone dots on the car’s side panels and wing appear evenly spaced and consistent in density without visible banding or irregular clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms the car into a comic-art style illustration, characterized by a halftone pattern indicative of print media. The halftone dots are consistently spaced and uniform across the car’s side panels and wing, maintaining an even density with no visible banding or irregular clustering. This evenness is essential to preserve the comic aesthetic, where consistent dot patterns create the shading effect.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors on the car (such as the wing and side panels) now rendered in muted orange, cream, and deep gray without any residual bright or unnatural hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vivid colors of the original are replaced by a muted palette fitting a comic-style image. The orange, cream, and deep gray are applied broadly across the car, effectively altering its color scheme to fit the aesthetic style typically used in printed comics. The absence of residual bright or unnatural hues supports this transformation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the motion lines behind the car straight, evenly spaced, and aligned with the direction of travel without curving or intersecting improperly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, typical comic techniques such as motion lines would be used to convey speed. However, upon reviewing the image, there are no explicit motion lines present behind the car to assess, indicating that the question's application does not align with the current portrayal in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the speech bubble containing “VROOM!” located above the car, fully visible, and free from overlap with the car’s wing or other structural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In reviewing Image B, there is no speech bubble visible containing text like 'VROOM!' above the car, indicating that no such element has been included or is interfering with the car’s graphic structure. The absence of this feature in the image means the condition cannot be met as outlined.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the background behind the car been simplified into flat or textured blocks without retaining detailed figures or structures that conflict with the comic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B has been abstracted into simple, high-contrast monochrome elements fitting the comic style. Details are minimized to capture only generalized presence rather than individual figures or structures, aligning effectively with the artistic transformation to a comic-like representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the car’s wheels properly aligned with the axles, and do the suspension arms maintain correct angles and connections without bending or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The comic-style representation in Image B retains structural fidelity in terms of the car's mechanical configuration. The wheels appear correctly positioned in relation to the axles, and the suspension elements maintain realistic connections without visible distortion, which is essential for preserving recognition of real-world mechanics in art.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the sponsor logos on the car’s wing and body still recognizable and legible despite the comic-style treatment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the simplified comic art approach in Image B, the sponsor logos remain distinguishable. Although they are stylized consistent with the comic effect, their essential shapes and placements have been preserved well enough to maintain recognizability and legibility, ensuring adherence to brand identification.",
