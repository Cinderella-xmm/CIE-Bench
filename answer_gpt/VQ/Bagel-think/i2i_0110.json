      "question": "Does the vase and sunflowers appear naturally integrated with the modern kitchen dining table without any noticeable distortions or discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase of sunflowers is placed on the dining table in a modern kitchen setting. However, the integration appears unnatural. The vivid, illustrative style of the sunflowers and vase, typical of Van Gogh's artwork, contrasts sharply against the realistic, modern kitchen background. The outline of the vase and flowers doesn't blend seamlessly with the environment around it, indicating noticeable discontinuities in style and rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the vase and sunflowers align logically with the direction and intensity of the sunlight coming through the venetian blinds in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunlight streaming through the venetian blinds generates a specific pattern of shadows and highlights on the kitchen surfaces. However, the vase and sunflowers do not reflect this lighting pattern. Their source lighting does not match the blinds' illumination direction and intensity, as the artistic style inherently does not incorporate realistic lighting effects.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the size and proportions of the vase and sunflowers realistic and proportionate relative to the modern kitchen dining table and surrounding space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vase and sunflowers in Image B appear disproportionately large compared to the kitchen dining table. A typical vase arrangement would be appropriately sized to fit comfortably on a dining or countertop but the vase here dominates the table area, which is improbable for normal functional decor. This proportion discrepancy made it look out of place.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the texture and material details of the vase and sunflowers retain their natural appearance and integrity, showing no signs of unnatural patterns or lost details after being placed in the new setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture and material of the vase and sunflowers in Image B maintain the distinct, bold brush strokes and vibrant colors typical of Van Gogh's style. However, when placed in this modern setting, they appear jarring and do not correspond with the surrounding texture details of the kitchen. The artistic style does not support integration with realistic materials around it.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall arrangement and positioning of the vase and sunflowers on the modern kitchen dining table, along with the background of sunlight through venetian blinds, create a harmonious and believable scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement in Image B lacks harmony due to the stark contrast between the vivid, impressionist style of the vase and sunflowers and the realistic modern kitchen environment. The differences in artistic style, lighting, and proportion disrupt the believability and cohesiveness of the scene, making the combination less seamless.",
