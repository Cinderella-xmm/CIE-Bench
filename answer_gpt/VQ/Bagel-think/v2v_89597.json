      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the calligraphic strokes and ink washes on the central touchscreen visually coherent and free from unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the central touchscreen with prominent calligraphic strokes, but they appear to be haphazard and lacking cohesion, with certain textures seeming unnatural for its environment. Such ink strokes should typically be smooth and integrated within the visual theme for coherence, which is not observed here due to the chaotic representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the wood paneling retain its structural consistency with bold brushwork, avoiding broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wood paneling area in Image B shows disconnected brush strokes that disrupt the natural linearity typically associated with wood finishes. Rather than bold, cohesive brushwork giving a structured appearance, the paneling appears fragmented, creating geometric inconsistencies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the airflow graphics been seamlessly integrated into the calligraphic style without causing visual distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airflow graphics are transformed into irregular calligraphic expressions, losing their original purpose and shape. The integration causes visual distortions that obscurate the functional aspect with an unsystematic calligraphic overlay.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the integration of the ink wash painting style with the vehicle's interior maintain overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The integration of ink wash painting within Image B has brought a significant alteration to the vehicle's interior, embedding a style that might not harmonize with overall automotive design. The resultant look tends towards abstract and lacks authenticity concerning vehicle interior standards.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the vehicle's interior preserved, and are there no visible artifacts introduced by the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited sections introduce artificial artifacts and abstract brushworks, obscuring finer details and precise structural elements prevalent in automotive design. Such alterations detract from the clarity and detail expected in the vehicle's interior portrayal.",
