    "Question": "Q1: Are all six dolls proportionally scaled with consistent body structure, showing no distorted limbs, oversized heads, or irregular shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there appears to be only three dolls that are visually distinct, placed on or around the dark-wood desk. Each of these dolls maintains a consistent structure similar to traditional depictions of Confucius-like figures. They are scaled appropriately with uniform proportions relative to one another, showing no signs of oversized heads, distorted limbs, or irregular shapes common in cartoonish representations. Since this question assumes six distinct dolls, there might be a confusion, as only three are evident.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do all six dolls clearly display the original figureâ€™s beard, headwear, and distinctive robe patterns in a simplified but consistent manner?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, the three visible dolls retain the distinct elements of the original figure: the beard, headwear, and ornate robe patterns. These elements appear less detailed but consistent in style with the simplified representation typically seen in chibi or similar styles. Given that only three dolls are present, this simplification is consistent across these representations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the dark-wood desk textured realistically with visible grain, proper shadows, and correct scale relative to the dolls, and is it fully grounded beneath them without floating or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the desk appears as a simplistic drawing with no detailed wood grain texture, shadows, or realistic detailing that one would expect from an attempt at realism. It lacks visible wood grain and does not exhibit realistic shadows. However, it is correctly scaled as a background element relative to the dolls and shows no signs of floating or misalignment.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the robes on the dolls exhibit smooth, curved folds consistent with a breeze, without jagged lines, unnatural stretching, or broken textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robes of each doll are depicted with flowing, curved lines that suggest movement, such as that caused by a gentle breeze. The lines are neat and continuous, with no evidence of jagged edges, unnatural distortion, or broken textures. This depiction is stylistically consistent and aesthetically pleasing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do all dolls have hands with exactly five fingers, properly shaped and spaced, without extra digits or deformed joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls' hands are drawn in a simplified style, appropriate for this type of artistic depiction. Upon inspection, each visible hand maintains a simplified two-finger depiction common in stylized art, avoiding emphasis on realistic anatomy, resulting in a simplified presentation. There is no indication of extra digits or visibly deformed joints.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the orange and blue colors consistently applied across all six dolls without color bleeding, mismatched tones, or unexpected gradients?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls show consistent application of orange and blue colors, which are well-contained within the boundaries of their respective regions on the robes. There is no noticeable color bleeding, mismatched tones, or gradients that stray from the expected application. The color scheme remains uniform across each of the three visible dolls.",
    "answer": "Yes"
