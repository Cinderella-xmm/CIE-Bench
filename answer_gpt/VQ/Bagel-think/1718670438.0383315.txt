    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass bell jar surrounding the robot have clear, smooth surfaces with natural reflections and refractions that do not distort the robot’s structure?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the glass bell jar covering the robot appears to have smooth surfaces with reflections. However, upon closer inspection, there are distortions visible, affecting the clarity of the robot’s structure through the glass. In real-world scenarios, smooth glass can still cause refractions and distortions depending on its thickness and curvature, which is evidenced here.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the pedestal under the robot properly aligned, proportionally sized, and made of materials consistent with the steampunk theme (e.g., brass, copper) without visible seams or deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pedestal appears consistent with the steampunk aesthetic, utilizing materials that resemble brass or copper. The alignment seems proper, and the pedestal size is proportional to the robot. There are no easily visible seams or deformation, supporting its integration into the theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the miniature clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils positioned at a plausible scale and orientation around the robot, with natural textures and no floating or disconnected parts?",
    "explanation": "The scale and orientation of clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils in Image B appear plausible in relation to the robot. The textures seem natural, and there are no indications of floating or disconnected parts as the components seem grounded and integrated with the base.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the glowing orbs emit a soft, localized glow that blends naturally with the ambient lighting and does not produce unnatural light artifacts or overexposed areas?",
    "explanation": "The glowing orb in Image B emits localized light that appears soft and blends naturally with the ambient lighting, without any noticeable light artifacts or overexposed areas. This is indicative of careful light source modeling within a controlled environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the etched patterns on the base of the glass jar sharp, detailed, and stylistically coherent with the steampunk aesthetic, without blurring or irregular lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the etched patterns on the base appear sharp and detailed. They are stylistically coherent with the steampunk theme, displaying intricate mechanical motifs without noticeable blurring or irregular lines.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the rusted metal background match the color and texture of the robot’s materials and blend seamlessly without visible edges or tonal inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B matches the rusty, metallic theme of the robot and blends well in terms of color and texture. There are no visible edges or tonal inconsistencies, indicating a seamless integration within the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
