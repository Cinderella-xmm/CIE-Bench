    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi Funko Pop-style figure maintain the structural coherence of the child's facial features without introducing unnatural distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure is styled similarly to standard Funko Pop designs, characterized by exaggerated features such as larger heads and smaller bodies. This style inherently includes distortions from realistic proportions but maintains structural coherence typical of this design, integrating stylized features appropriately without resulting in unnatural distortions particular to the chibi style. Therefore, despite being stylized, the coherence of facial features is maintained according to the design conventions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the tech-related accessories added to the chibi figure free of unnatural textures and integrated smoothly with the figure's design?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi figure holding a small electronic device (tablet) and wearing large headphones. These accessories have smooth textures which are consistent with the typical vinyl and plastic materials used for Funko Pop figures. The integration of these tech accessories appears seamless within the stylized aesthetics of the figure, without introducing awkward or unnatural textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the casual attire of the chibi figure retain its realistic texture and detail, avoiding any loss of fine details?",
    "explanation": "The attire in Image B is simplified to match the stylized nature of Funko Pop figures, prioritizing smooth surfaces over realistic textures. Although this simplification may reduce the level of detail seen in real clothing, it is typical of chibi figures where individual texture details are not emphasized, but overall design coherence is maintained.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the cross-legged sitting pose of the chibi figure with the tablet anatomically plausible and free of any unnatural deformations?",
    "explanation": "The cross-legged pose of the chibi figure in Image B, combined with the placement of the tablet, follows the expected proportions and style of Funko Pop figures. Despite the inherent stylization, the pose appears plausible within the context of this styleâ€”without unexpected or unnatural deformations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the figure outside the packaging exhibit lifelike textures and lighting, contributing to a highly detailed and visually plausible product visualization?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the figure which does not exhibit lifelike textures, as funko pop figures inherently have smoother, stylized surfaces reminiscent of their collectible nature. Lighting primarily enhances the visibility of the figure's form, but textures remain simple without lifelike detailing. Though light showcases the features of the figure well, textural realism is secondary to stylistic consistency.",
    "answer": "No"
