      "question": "Does the green field appear to float above the starry background with clean, continuous edges and no visible distortions or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green field is presented at the bottom of the umbrella with a starry sky above. It maintains clean and continuous edges without visible distortions or broken geometry, due to a well-edited transition between the grassy landscape and the cosmic backdrop. This visual presentation makes it appear as though the field floats in front of the stars.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the yellow and red flowers vividly colored but free from unnatural texture artifacts or color fringing around their petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The yellow and red flowers in Image B are vivid, implying well-saturated colors. However, there are visible unnatural texture artifacts or color fringing around the petals. The editing has introduced some inconsistencies in the texture, which suggests that the petals have some distortions that affect the naturalness of their appearance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the apple-shaped object in the sky significantly larger than the tree and properly lit with consistent shading and texture, resembling a real fruit rather than a flat graphic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple-shaped object indeed appears much larger than the tiny figures of the humans and the tree. However, the shading and texture make it appear more like a surreal object rather than a real fruit. The editing gives it an inconsistent texture and lighting, making the fruit look like a graphic rather than realistic.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the insect figures (bee and butterfly) stylized but still identifiable, with smooth contours and no anatomical deformities or fragmented parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the insect figures such as the bee and the butterfly are stylized yet identifiable. However, examination reveals a lack of smooth contours, leading to an incomplete depiction with minor anatomical deformities. The figures look slightly unnatural or fragmented in their parts, which indicates poor consistency in texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the tree replaced by a hollow, angular geometric form with clean lines and internal voids, matching the surreal style without appearing fragmented or physically impossible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, close examination reveals that the tree is not replaced by an angular geometric form at all. The tree exists in its whole natural form without alteration into a hollow geometry form. Therefore, it does not match the surreal requirement described in the question.",
