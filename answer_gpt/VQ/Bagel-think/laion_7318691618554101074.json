      "question": "Do the crystal wands have smooth, continuous surfaces with consistent refraction and no visible digital artifacts or irregularities in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal wands appear to have smooth surfaces with consistent refraction properties. The light interacts with them in a consistent manner, similar to how light would behave with real glass or crystal materials. There are no visible digital artifacts, such as jagged edges or pixelation, that would indicate irregularities in shape. This suggests that the wands are rendered realistically and accurately.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the etched floral patterns on the crystal vase evenly distributed, continuous, and visually integrated into the surface without breaking lines or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The etched floral patterns seen on the crystal vase in Image B are evenly distributed over the surface of the vase. The patterns have continuous lines without visible breaks, and the shading aligns with the natural variations one would expect from light interacting with a textured surface. This visual integration suggests a well-crafted design without digital artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the carved crystal ribbon fully formed with intact floral motifs and no visible breaks, overlaps, or flattened areas that suggest a 2D-to-3D conversion error?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no explicit representation of a 'crystal ribbon' mentioned in the context of the vase and wands, so this question may refer generally to the seamless appearance of designs on the vase. If it pertains to any decorative motifs on the vase, they appear intact with consistent 3D representation, showing no evidence of breaks, overlaps, or conversion errors from 2D to 3D.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the reflection on the mirrored surface show a clear, undistorted image of the crystal vase and its contents, with proper symmetry and matching lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection of the crystal vase on the mirrored surface in Image B maintains clarity and symmetry, showing a coherent reflection without distortion. The lighting appears consistent between the actual objects and their reflections, suggesting accurate rendering of reflections with proper physical representation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pearls uniformly sized, evenly spaced, and free from warping or blurring that suggests compression or incorrect rendering due to the crystal vase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the crystal vase with wands, and there are no visible pearls within it to assess their size or spacing. However, assuming this question inaccurately cross-references pearls from Image A, the contents (crystal wands) are consistently rendered without issues that suggest compression or blurring, as the wands are distinct and clear through the crystal.",
