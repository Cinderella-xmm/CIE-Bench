      "question": "Does the orange retain a realistic glossy texture without unnatural or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a rubber keychain that is designed to resemble an orange. The surface appears smooth and consistent, typical of a manufactured object, without the unevenness or pixelation that might be present in a poorly edited image. The glossy finish adds a shiny yet artificial look, characteristic of plastic or rubber materials, rather than the natural gloss of an actual orange. Therefore, the keychain maintains a consistent and intact texture for its intended material.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the stem of the orange well-integrated into the rubber keychain design, maintaining a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stem appears as a simple painted or molded feature on the rubber keychain. It is integrated into the overall design but does not attempt to mimic the natural appearance of an orange stem, as its purpose is more ornamental. The shape and color fit the context of a keychain design rather than an actual fruit, suggesting a focus on stylization over realism. Due to the nature of a keychain, realistic integration is not the main objective.",

      "question": "Do the proportions and shape of the keychain maintain a believable keychain structure, avoiding any distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain is depicted as a compact and symmetrical spherical object with a metallic band and a keychain loop, typical of many novelty keychains. The curvature and dimensions conform to expectations for a small, portable accessory, without any apparent distortions. The overall structure is consistent with how a keychain of this type should look, maintaining a coherent and believable form.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the color of the orange keychain accurately reflect a citrus hue, contributing to the authenticity and visual credibility of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain is colored with a bright, vibrant orange hue, closely resembling the color of an actual orange. This choice effectively aligns with the common visual expectations for objects modeled after fruit, serving both decorative and thematic purposes. The color enhances the keychain's recognizable representation of an orange, making it visually credible within its context as a novelty item.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition between the rubber keychain material and the orange's surface seamless, contributing to overall visual coherence and plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition is fairly seamless for an object consisting of molded rubber. The keychain is designed with a smooth surface and consistent finish, typical for manufactured items. As a piece designed for aesthetics, the integration prioritizes visual coherence within the constraints of the material and purpose, where absolute realism is not necessary. Therefore, the overall integration appears plausible.",
