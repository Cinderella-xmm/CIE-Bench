    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the wings display a smooth, translucent gradient resembling flowing water without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural banding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragonfly's wings exhibit a seamless transition of blue shades, resembling flowing water. The edges of the wings are smooth, with clear gradation from one color to another without visible pixelation or unnatural banding. This indicates high image quality in terms of smoothness and realistic representation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scales on the dragonfly’s body evenly distributed, aligned with its natural segmentation, and do they exhibit smooth color transitions without abrupt edges or repetitive patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scales on the dragonfly's body in Image B are arranged to complement its segmented structure. They have a smooth gradient from darker blue at the thorax to lighter shades on the abdomen. There are no abrupt edges, and the transitions between colors and scale pattern appear natural without repetition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the eyes retain their spherical shape and contain layered, dark blue internal structures that suggest depth, without appearing flattened or unnaturally textured?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragonfly's eyes in Image B maintain their spherical form. The layered internal structures in dark blue provide depth and dimension, rather than a flat appearance. The texturing within the eyes is refined, enhancing their realism without unnatural effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the aquatic vines wrapped around the dragonfly’s legs in a continuous, non-intersecting manner, with a soft glowing edge that does not bleed into surrounding areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vines around the dragonfly’s legs wrap in a seamless, continuous way, showing no intersections. These vines possess a glowing edge that is softly defined, without bleeding into adjacent regions, maintaining visual clarity and separation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mist evenly diffused around the dragonfly, fading gradually into the air without sharp edges, clumping, or unnatural brightness spikes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mist in Image B is uniformly spread across the scene, especially around the dragonfly. It gradually fades into the background, maintaining smooth transitions without sharp edges, clumps, or area-specific brightness anomalies, enhancing the atmosphere and realism of the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the reflection in the water accurately depict the edited dragonfly’s features, including wings, body patterns, and vines, with appropriate distortion and reduced brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection in the water in Image B effectively mirrors the edited dragonfly's form and features. The wings, body patterns, including the scales, and vines are properly represented. The reflection is distorted as expected from water, with brightness appropriately moderated to convey distance and depth below the surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
