      "question": "Does the skateboard maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility after being rendered in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard has been rendered in a 3D cartoon style with a bright, vibrant appearance. The skateboard's structure, including the deck, trucks, and wheels, looks consistent and credible. The colors and graphics are exaggerated but stay true to the real-world design principles of skateboards. This suggests a successful translation into a 3D cartoon format while maintaining its original form's integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and details of the skater's clothing natural and free of artifacts in the 3D cartoon rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's clothing, including the jacket and hat, appears smooth and simplified, typical of a 3D cartoon style. The textures are clean and the graphical representation avoids any visible artifacts that might disrupt visual consistency. This suggests the clothing's rendering is free of distortions or irregularities, maintaining a natural appearance within the stylistic constraints.",

      "question": "Do the skill stats and bars appear naturally integrated into the character card without disrupting the overall visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character card includes text and symbols at the bottom section. These elements are incorporated smoothly without overpowering the character image or disrupting the card's flow. The typography and layout are orderly and legibly positioned within the card. The integration appears seamless, fitting well with the overall design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the skater's pose and body proportions depicted naturally and without distortion in the 3D cartoon aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's pose, wearing a coat and hat, remains in a natural stance, similar to Image A, maintaining realistic body proportions. The adaptation to a 3D cartoon style is effective, capturing the fluidity and realism of the pose without introducing distortions or disproportionate elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the urban scenery and clear sky background enhance the skater and skateboard's visual credibility without introducing structural inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the urban background with buildings and a clear sky follows a cartoon style but complements the skater and skateboard by maintaining a realistic scene structure. The rendering does not introduce any inconsistencies; instead, it supports the visual coherence and credibility of the entire scene, enriching the 3D cartoon aesthetic.",
