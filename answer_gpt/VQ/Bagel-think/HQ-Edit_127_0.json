      "question": "Are the textures of the owl’s feathers and the tree bark rendered with realistic detail and variation, without unnatural repetition or synthetic-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is depicted with a stylized, illustrative appearance rather than a realistic one. The feathers are painted in a way typical of illustrated art, with patterns that are uniform and smooth, but not necessarily realistic. Similarly, the tree bark does not have the fine, varied texture that would be expected in a realistic depiction. This suggests that while the rendering is clean, it is not aimed at realism but instead at a consistent artistic style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the moon depicted as a circular dotted diagram with evenly spaced dots and clear, legible labels indicating lunar phases, without jagged edges or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of a round element near the bottom right, which might be intended as a moon phase diagram. It consists of a circle with evenly spaced dots. However, because of the artistic style of the image and the illegible text, it does not clearly indicate lunar phases in a conventional, readable manner. Given the artistic and illustrative approach throughout the image, it could be interpreted as more stylistic rather than an accurately labeled scientific diagram.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the labels pointing to the owl’s talons and feathers placed without overlapping vital features, and do they use consistent line styles and text formatting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several labels point to different parts of the owl. The lines seem evenly spaced and do not overlap the primary illustration. However, the text formatting is not completely legible, showing a mix of letters that do not form coherent words, indicating consistency in style but not in clarity or accuracy.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text box located at the bottom of the image, sized appropriately, and styled with earthy tones and readable typography that matches the botanical illustration theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text box in Image B is positioned at the bottom, spanning the entire width. It uses earthy tones consistent with the overall color palette of the illustration. However, the text itself is not standard English, with most words being nonsensical or lorem ipsum-like, which although matches the visual style, does not achieve readability.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the owl sit naturally on the tree branch with correct posture and claw positioning, and is the tree trunk and branch structure continuous and anatomically plausible without breaks or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is perched in a stylized illustration, with claws visible on the branch. The overall posture appears intentionally artistic rather than anatomically accurate. The tree branch and trunk are continuous in design, but stylized without realistic anatomical detail. This suggests an artistic consistency, though not striving for naturalism.",
