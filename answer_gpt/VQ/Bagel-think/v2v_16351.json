      "question": "Are the lockers in the background seamlessly replaced with mid-century modern showroom elements without visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lockers in the background are replaced with a plain, white background and a display area featuring a mid-century modern chair. The matte finish and simplistic style are consistent with modern showroom aesthetics.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the chair is proportionally placed within the display area formerly occupied by the sports jersey.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gestures and body language of the characters in Image B do not seem altered to clash with the showroom setting. The character in the suit, who previously gestured toward the jersey, now gestures toward the chair in a manner that remains contextually consistent with presenting an item on display, maintaining natural body language.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears even and consistent throughout the scene, illuminating the characters and the displayed chair appropriately. There are no harsh shadows or unnatural lighting effects that would point to inconsistencies in this new setting.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the characters and their clothing are consistent. There are no changes to their uniforms, poses, or any other features, except for the altered background and the replacement of the jersey with a piece of furniture.",
