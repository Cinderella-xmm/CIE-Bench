    "Question": "Q1: Does the character's face retain its natural proportions and features without any visible distortion or unnatural textures after being rendered in a 3D cartoon style?",
    "explanation": "To address this question, visual observation of the edited image suggests focusing on areas other than the face due to the blur. Evaluating elements such as hair and attire can give insights into the realistic portrayal of the character's features. The rest of the image maintains smooth transitions and proportional characteristics, indicative of a smooth transition to a 3D cartoon style. However, the face is not assessable due to the blur, hence limiting the ability to confirm its retention of natural proportions.",

The smooth contours and lack of visible disruptions in the shapes indicate that the 3D rendering style has preserved the outfit's structural integrity. The shoulders and neckline are clearly defined, and the absence of any broken shapes suggests a successful translation to 3D cartoon style.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the programmer-related tools or icons, such as code fragments or keyboards, integrated into the artwork in a way that complements the character and background without introducing any visual inconsistencies or unnatural placements?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, there are no visible programmer-related tools or icons integrated into the artwork. The design focuses primarily on the character and the decorative border, without additional elements such as code fragments or keyboards. As no such elements are present to assess within the image, it can be concluded that they are not part of the evaluation.",
