      "question": "Does the glass-like surface of the transformed Eiffel Tower show natural transparency and subtle reflections consistent with real glass under overcast lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower has been transformed into a glass-like structure. Analyzing this glass surface involves checking if it exhibits qualities typical of glass under such lighting conditions, like transparency through which objects can be subtly seen and reflections that aren't overpowering but are reflective of the lighting scenario. However, in Image B, the glass doesn't seem to exhibit real transparency or subtle reflections. It lacks the expected optical qualities such as natural reflections and transparency that are common in real glass for such a scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the embossed patterns on the glass surface aligned with the original lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower and proportionally consistent across all levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, assessing the alignment and proportion of embossed patterns involves examining whether these patterns follow the original design architecture. The embossed design should mimic the intricate latticework of the Eiffel Tower, extending consistently from base to top without any deviation. The patterns on Image B seem overlaid and do not correspond to the lattice structure, as they are more ornamental and lack precise alignment with the tower's structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold-plated base positioned correctly at the bottom of the tower, with smooth edges and consistent metallic texture that matches the scale and lighting of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed lower part of the tower appears as a gold-plated base. A precise evaluation entails checking the position aligning with the traditional bottom of the tower, with edges that are smooth and a metallic finish that complements the scene's lighting. The gold base, although positioned at the bottom, doesn't integrate well aesthetically or in texture, appearing alien to the existing scene due to inconsistent texture and unrealistic edges.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Parisian skyline motif visible along the glass surface without distorting the towerâ€™s shape or appearing as a floating or disconnected element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, the integration of a Parisian skyline motif must naturally coincide with the structure of the tower without additional elements appearing out of place or floating. A coherent appearance is crucial, avoiding any distortion of the tower's shape. The skyline motif is not explicitly seen or seems to float or looks separate from the glass surface which distorts the iconic structure.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the logo at the neck of the bottle clearly defined, centered, and free from jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The logo on Image B should be sharply defined and positioned correctly at the neck of the bottle-like transformation with no visual artifacts such as jagged edges or blurring due to texture artifacts. The logo indeed appears unclear and not properly centered, displaying texture artifacts that compromise its clarity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the main structural elements of the tower (legs, arches, central column) preserved in correct proportion and alignment, with no signs of stretching or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluating Image B involves checking for the preservation of the Eiffel Tower's key structural elements: its legs, arches, and central column should retain correct proportions and alignment. In this image, these elements are transformed severely into a glass structure and do not maintain their original geometric integrity or proportions, indicating distortion.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as pixelation, color bleeding, or unnatural reflections around the transformed tower or its components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Resolving Image B requires inspecting for any technical artifacts that could impact visual quality. These include pixelation, an unusual color spread across boundaries (color bleeding), or inconsistent lighting effects leading to unnatural reflections. There are noticeable instances of such artifacts, particularly around the newly transformed glass-like structure.",
