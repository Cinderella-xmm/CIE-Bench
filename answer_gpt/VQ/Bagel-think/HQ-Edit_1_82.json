      "question": "Do the gymnast’s limbs maintain natural joint angles and proportional lengths without exaggerated bends or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast's limbs appear to maintain natural joint angles and proportional lengths. The legs and arms do not show exaggerated bends, which maintains a realistic representation of a gymnast's posture. This assessment comes from observing the body positioning and comparing it with known gymnastics poses, which typically involve stretch and balance without unnatural contortions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the seams and fabric folds on the leotard clearly defined and flowing naturally, without jagged edges or unnatural creasing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seams and fabric folds on the leotard flow naturally and are well-defined, offering a realistic representation of sportswear. The leotard's surface does not have jagged edges or creases that would suggest poor image manipulation or rendering artifacts. Observing the common structure and smooth appearance of athletic fabric helps deduce that the presentation is natural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors used in the gymnast’s outfit and background consistently within the earthy tone range without sudden shifts or clashing hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors on the gymnast’s outfit and background are harmonious and appear consistent without abrupt shifts or clashing shades. While the primary tone is not necessarily earthy, as the outfit and background include vibrant colors more commonly associated with sports and events, there is no discordance in hues between elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sequin patterns aligned with the existing design on the leotard and uniformly distributed without clustering or overlapping in unnatural ways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sequin patterns on the leotard appear aligned and complement the design without evident clustering or overlapping. The sequins follow the intended patterns usually seen on athletic leotards; they are uniform and distributed to enhance the ornate design rather than disrupt it.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the panel boundaries positioned so that key figures and objects (e.g., gymnast’s head, balance beam) are fully contained within one panel without being split or truncated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the panel boundaries are positioned such that key figures, such as the gymnast and the balance beam, are fully contained within one panel. This is determined by observing each segment in the framed display and noting that objects are not interrupted by panel separations, which preserves the integrity of the visual narrative.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the dark walnut frame have a uniform texture and depth, and does it sit flush around the artwork without casting unnatural shadows or appearing translucent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark walnut frame has a consistent texture and depth, maintaining a seamless and flush fit around the segmented artwork. It does not cast unnatural shadows or appear translucent, reflecting the characteristics expected from a high-quality wooden frame surrounding pictorial contents.",
