    "Question": "Q1: Are the geometric patterns on the dress preserved as continuous, non-distorted shapes without broken edges or misaligned tiles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric patterns on the dress appear to be distorted and have a mosaic-like effect, which causes the shapes to break into multiple tiles. This alteration leads to misaligned edges and discontinuous shapes. When compared to Image A, the patterns are clearly continuous and well-defined without any distortions.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the necklaces appear as flat, transparent stained glass tiles with consistent color gradients and no jagged or pixelated edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the necklaces seem to be altered with a stained-glass effect, resulting in a flat, tile-like appearance. This effect introduces a noticeable pixelated and jagged edge, which contrasts with the original image where the necklaces appear round and smooth. The edited image lacks the consistent smooth gradients found in natural beads.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the individual braids still distinguishable and proportionally accurate, with smooth transitions between segments and no collapsed or fused strands?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the individual braids appear to be maintained as distinguishable elements. However, there are some alterations due to the mosaic effect that can cause segments to appear slightly distorted or chunky. Despite this, the braids remain largely proportionate and free from collapses or fusions, resembling their appearance in the original.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the background display varied textures and elevation changes consistent with natural terrain, without uniform patches or unnatural color blending?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to have a heavy mosaic and artistic filter applied, which alters the natural texture and color gradients significantly. The varied textures and natural terrain are replaced by more uniform patterns and contrasting color blends, deviating from the natural look in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the bracelets on both arms symmetrically positioned, correctly numbered, and free from distortion such as stretching or overlapping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bracelets appear to be symmetrically positioned on both arms and maintain the correct number as seen in the original image. However, due to the mosaic effect, there may be minor visual artifacts or distortions present, though not significant enough to affect overall symmetry and placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
