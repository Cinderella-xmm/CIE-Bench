      "question": "Does the marble texture beneath the teapot exhibit natural veining and color variation without abrupt edges or artificial patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the teapot appears to be a marble texture, which typically features natural veining and color variations. The observed texture in Image B does have organic lines and coloration variations typical of marble, with no noticeable abrupt edges or artificial-looking patterns. Thus, the marble texture appears natural.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the transparent label positioned on the teapotâ€™s body with uniform opacity and no visible pixelation or ghosting around the text edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the teapot in Image B, there is no evidence of a transparent label on the teapot's body, as the label seems to be integrated with the box's design rather than a separate entity on the teapot. Thus, the question regarding uniform opacity and pixelation does not apply to an existing label on the teapot.",

      "question": "Does the gold monogram on the lid align with the surrounding engravings in terms of depth, shadow, and metallic finish, without appearing raised or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lid of the teapot features a gold monogram that is symmetrical with the ornate style seen throughout the teapot. The alignment in terms of depth and shadow appears consistent with the rest of the metallic engravings. The finish also appears harmonious with the teapot's overall metallic nature, hence not appearing raised or detached.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the box positioned adjacent to the teapot with correct perspective and scale, and does it feature consistent engraving patterns and material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box seems to be designed with a clear intent to complement the teapot, showing consistent patterns and a similar metallic appearance. The perspective aligns correctly, making the box look proportionate and properly scaled next to the teapot. Thus, both positioning and design are well-executed.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the teapot and box consistent with the light source direction and do they match the ambient lighting of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the shadows in Image B, it appears the shadows of both the teapot and the box are consistent with the light source coming from the top left, given the shadow placement and the ambient lighting seen in the scene. The shadows are soft and blend well, without appearing out of place or inconsistent with the light direction.",
