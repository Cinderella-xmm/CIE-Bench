      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine maintain the structural consistency of the man climbing the ladder, avoiding any unnatural distortions or deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figurine shows the man climbing the ladder in a miniature and cartoonish form. The details of the man's suit and pose are exaggerated yet retain the core elements of the original pose, which is typical of the chibi style. This involves shortening the limbs and creating a more robust, compact form, common in chibi art. Despite the stylistic changes, there is no evident distortion that seems out of place or unnatural for this art style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the materials and textures of the chibi-style figurine and its environment free from unnatural artifacts and maintain a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a clean 3D-rendered scene with smooth and consistent surfaces typical of chibi figures. The textures are intentionally simplistic, matching the expected aesthetic of a chibi-styled diorama with minimal and uniform coloration and material representation. There does not appear to be any unintentional artifacts that would distract from this stylized representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the ladder and window in the 3D-rendered scene retain their proper proportions and physical rationality, contributing to the visual credibility of the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ladder and window are depicted in a three-dimensional model consistent with typical chibi-style design. The proportions are purposely kept simple and minimalistic but are structurally logical within the bounds of the display. The dimensions provide a reasonable impression of balance and stability, suitable for a figurine's environment.",

      "question": "Are the details of the pastel-colored display box, including the soft cream hue and subtle gold detailing, preserved without loss of fine details or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses soft pastel tones and simple geometric lines typical of chibi styling. The colors are consistent and lively, and any details on the display box, such as edges and borders, remain clear without showing degradation in quality or texture oddities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the warm golden lighting in the diorama cast gentle shadows that enhance the scene's authenticity and natural appearance without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, warm lighting is used effectively to highlight the elements of the scene, such as the figure and environmental features, creating soft shadows that enhance depth and interest without overshadowing or disrupting the scene's visual integrity.",
