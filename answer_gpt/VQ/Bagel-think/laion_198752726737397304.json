      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the superhero costumes on all five individuals have consistent fabric textures and realistic draping that follow the contours of their bodies without unnatural stretching or folding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the superhero costumes appear cartoon-like, with bold colors and simplistic design typical of animated illustrations rather than realistic clothing. The fabric texture is not consistent with real-life drapery as cartoon illustrations tend to have flat textures without realistic folds. This is typical in cartoons where detailed fabric textures are often omitted for style. Thus, the costumes do not have realistic draping or fabric textures, indicating an idealized rather than realistic gaming or animated style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the hands holding the Daffodil Power Passes positioned naturally with five fingers visible per hand, appropriate grip pressure, and no signs of clipping or floating objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are illustrated in a cartoonish style without any accessories like tickets being physically held, which contrasts with the reality-based structure of Image A. There are no visible cards or familiar objects held by characters, as this detail is completely transformed into expressive speech bubbles and simplified artistic portrayal in the cartoon format. Since there are no objects held or visible fingers as per natural human hand structure, natural grip is not applicable.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the poses of the five individuals physically plausible, with joints aligned naturally and no bent limbs or disproportionate body segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon style allows for creative freedom, resulting in simplified representations that may deliberately diverge from realistic anatomical proportions to achieve a stylized effect. However, the limbs appear proportionate relative to animated standards and do not exhibit unnatural bends, probability being intended within expressive cartoon norms. Comparatively, real-life posture in Image A confirms proportionate and feasible poses, showing a continuity in joint alignment, despite stylistic differences.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dialogue bubbles positioned above or near the heads of the individuals without overlapping eyes or mouths, and do they display legible text with clean edges and no visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dialogue bubbles are indeed strategically positioned above or near the individuals' heads as per typical comic illustration conventions, ensuring unobstructed visibility regarding facial features. The text inside these bubbles is legible, albeit stylized for effect, with clear edges and no visual malformations or artifacts, maintaining clarity consistent with standard aesthetic expectations for animated or illustrated scenes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the enhanced garden background visually coherent with the original scene, featuring consistent lighting, natural flower arrangements, and no abrupt color shifts or artificial-looking textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image A shows a realistic garden scene with natural lighting and authentic texture, Image B redesigns this background in an animated style where vibrant colors and simplified details are prominent. The artistic reinterpretation features cartoonish flower illustrations and does not attempt to achieve realism, instead opting for stylistic and exaggerated color schemes, intentionally invoking artificial artistic charm instead of mimicking real-life coherence.",
