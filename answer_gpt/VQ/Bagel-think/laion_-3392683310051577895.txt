    "Question": "Q1: Do the curled horn-like structures on both armrests have smooth, continuous curves without jagged edges or inconsistent thickness?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the curled horn-like structures on the armrests exhibit grooves and pointy elements, suggesting a texture resembling horns. Such characteristics may include jagged edges or variation in thickness, distinguishing them from perfectly smooth curves. Therefore, analyzing the details, which incorporate world knowledge of horn textures being typically uneven, leads to the conclusion.",

    "Question": "Q5: Do the wooden limbs extend from under the front edge of the sofa, resting firmly on the carpet, with vines wrapped around clawed ends that appear structurally sound and proportionate to the sofa's size?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs are designed to resemble wood, extending from the sofa's front, meeting the carpet below. While they appear proportionate, their position signifies they should appear firmly placed, but additional analysis needed might question their complete structural integrity due to being more decorative than functional.",
    "answer": "No"
