    "Question": "Q1: Is the sun disc replacing the Sphinx’s head seamlessly integrated with the neck and body, showing no jagged edges or misaligned contours?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sun disc is placed where the Sphinx's head traditionally is. The integration with the neck and body does show some differences in context with the place where the head would naturally connect to the neck. The disc isn't a natural extension and appears more like an added graphical element rather than seamlessly attached to the Sphinx's body. This kind of integration often requires clear alignment and blending to appear natural, which is missing here.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the golden wings extend symmetrically from the sides of the Sphinx’s body with smooth, continuous surfaces and natural curvature?",
    "explanation": "The golden wings in Image B extend from one side of the Sphinx, which contrast with the symmetrical appearance that wings should ideally have for balance in art. They appear as added graphical elements rather than part of the original structure. The wings do not display continuity or symmetry, which would require mirroring and natural blending with the object's form.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the sand flows on the limbs continuous and gravity-consistent, without abrupt breaks or floating segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no clear, extended portions resembling sand flows on the Sphinx's limbs. The clouds surrounding the Sphinx may obscure some details, but generally, without visible sand flows, it's not possible to assess their continuity or relation to gravity. There is no evident depiction of sand flows represented in a manner consistent with gravity, frame, and surface.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ankhs on the paws correctly shaped, properly scaled, and emitting a soft, localized glow without distorting adjacent textures?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not display noticeable ankhs on the Sphinx’s paws. The focus is more on the added elements like the sun disc and wings. An ankh would be a distinct symbol requiring careful attention to scale, shape, and texture, but these details aren’t present or noticeable.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the entire edited figure exhibit consistent lighting and shading across all added elements, with no visible seams or texture mismatches?",
    "explanation": "The edited elements in Image B, such as the sun disc and wings, exhibit differing textures and lighting from the existing Sphinx structure. The sun disc glows brightly, an effect less subtly integrated into the scene, leading to visible texture differences. Consistency in lighting typically requires blending elements under the same tone and shadow scheme, which does not appear to be fully realized here due to mismatched textures and lighting variations.",
    "answer": "No"
