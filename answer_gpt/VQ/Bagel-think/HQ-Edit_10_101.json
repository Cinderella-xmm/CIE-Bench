      "question": "Are the knitted textures on the cardigan visibly exaggerated but still consistent with real knitting patterns, without broken stitches or irregular loops?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knitted textures on the cardigan are prominent, with exaggerated detail that accentuates the patterns, resembling real knitting. This exaggeration helps highlight the texture without causing the appearance of broken stitches or irregular loops. Knitting patterns often have regular loops, and the cardigan in Image B mirrors this consistency, thus maintaining realism despite the enhanced detail.",
