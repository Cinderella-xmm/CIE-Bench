      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the chocolate cake and sauce transformed into sneaker textures naturally, without any obvious unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show that the sneaker's surface is textured to resemble the crumbly texture of chocolate cake, with areas of the shoe having a consistent dark brown shade that can be associated with chocolate sauce. The use of a glossy material around the lace area and heel suggests a mimicry of the glossy nature of chocolate sauce. These transformations appear smooth and the textures blend well without any obvious discrepancies or artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the transformation maintain the structural consistency of the dessert, avoiding any distortion or broken geometric shapes in the sneaker design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the sneaker design presents consistent shapes and structures that align well with common sneaker designs. There is no evident distortion or misalignment in its shapes that one might typically expect if the transformation were poorly executed. The shoe retains its structural integrity the way a cake should remain whole.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the core element of the chocolate dessert still recognizable in the sneaker concept, maintaining visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the sneaker does incorporate chocolate-like textures and color themes, the core element of a chocolate dessert is not immediately obvious. It requires imaginative interpretation to connect the shoe's design back to a dessert, particularly to one with chocolate and leafy elements.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the lettuce preserved in the fluid, natural contours of the sneaker design, avoiding degradation of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sneaker design does not showcase any evident representation or preservation of lettuce details. The design elements and color palette do not suggest any leafy or green textures typically associated with lettuce, hence no preservation of those details is recognizable. The adaptation has not taken any aspect of the lettuce into the sneaker's design.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition and layout of the sneaker design visually credible and coherent, despite being an imaginative concept?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sneaker in Image B maintains an overall coherent and well-balanced design. The use of brown tones and textured surfaces in a true-to-sneaker form factor supports its visual credibility despite being an imaginative concept. The layout and design elements look polished and intentional, contributing to a credible and cohesive appearing sneaker.",
