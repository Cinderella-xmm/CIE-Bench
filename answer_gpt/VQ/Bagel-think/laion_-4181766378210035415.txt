    "Question": "Q1: Are all LEGO bricks forming the bed frame, mattress, and base properly aligned and interlocked without visible gaps or misalignments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure looks to be a LEGO construction, with bricks stacked to form the bed. On closely observing the interlocking pattern, all bricks appear properly aligned and interlocked, showing no visible gaps or misalignments commonly expected if pieces were incorrectly placed. The consistency of alignment is key in LEGO structures for stability and aesthetics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Does the light blue floral pattern on the duvet appear consistent with the original design, with no missing or incorrectly placed colored bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bed constructed is made of plain LEGO bricks, without any floral pattern represented. LEGO bricks typically have solid colors, and any patterned effect would require a specific arrangement of colored bricks. Since there is no attempt to replicate a floral pattern through this, the design is inconsistent with what would be on a fabric duvet.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the curved shape of the new headboard composed of LEGO-style elements that follow realistic LEGO curvature without appearing stretched or deformed?",
    "explanation": "The headboard in Image B is made from standard LEGO bricks, which are typically rectangular. Any curvature in LEGO constructions is achieved through staggered placement of bricks to mimic a curve. However, in the image, the headboard appears largely straight and blocky, not following a realistic LEGO-style curvature pattern. Thus, the curvature does not appear as natural as a realistic LEGO extension would be.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the pillows formed by stacked LEGO bricks showing a natural three-dimensional shape with appropriate layering and no floating or disconnected pieces?",
    "explanation": "The pillows in Image B are depicted as a stack of LEGO bricks. However, the three-dimensional shape is achieved by vertical and/or horizontal layering of bricks. The alignment looks cohesive, without any floating pieces or noticeable disconnections. The natural transition from one brick to the next indicates a proper connection, emulating a natural pillow shape as much as the medium allows.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the shadows cast by the LEGO bed match the lighting direction and softness of the original image, with no unnatural dark spots or over-bright areas?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the shadows cast by the LEGO bed adhere to a consistent lighting direction, as is typical with a real-world 3D object under lighting sources. The shadows appear soft and coherent with general lighting norms, avoiding any unnatural dark spots or over-bright areas that would suggest inconsistent rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the proportions and positions of the pillows, duvet, and headboard consistent with the original bed, with no noticeable scaling errors or misplaced elements?",
    "explanation": "In comparing Image A and B, while the bed from Image A has traditional pillow and duvet proportions, Image B uses LEGO bricks. Despite that medium, the proportions of the elements (like the LEGO headboard, pillows, and remaining structures) seem consistent with the general scale depicted in the original image. There's no large discrepancy in scaling or positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do all LEGO bricks have a uniform matte finish with no unnatural glossiness, transparency, or pixelation that would suggest low-quality rendering?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, the LEGO bricks display a uniform matte finish, typical of real LEGO bricks which donâ€™t usually exhibit excessive glossiness when rendered. There are no indications of transparency or pixelation in the visual, which commonly points to clean rendering quality without distortions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
