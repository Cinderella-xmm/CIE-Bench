    "Question": "Q1: Do the feathered wing extensions on the sides of the door maintain consistent wood grain and carving depth, with smooth transitions from the original panel edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the feathered wings are depicted as large, colorful, and textured additions that extend out from the sides of the door. These wings appear to be made of a different material (feathers) and have a completely different texture compared to the wood grain of the door. The transition from the original wood panel to the feathered wings is not smooth or consistent with the original door's material. This represents a significant visual and material change from the original wooden panel shown in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the shimmering eyes formed from the iron studs aligned with their original positions and embedded within the wood without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shimmering eyes are depicted as bright, glowing, and distinctly different elements than the iron studs in Image A. These eyes are not aligned with the positions of the iron studs in Image A and appear to float above the surface rather than being embedded within the wood, indicating an overlap and misalignment.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the celestial crown emerging from the arch maintain continuous curvature and seamless integration with the original arch shape, without broken lines or floating pieces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the celestial crown appears to be an ornate, distinct addition emerging from the top of the archway. While it may stylistically fit the theme, this crown is not seamlessly integrated with the original arch shape; the edges do not appear continuous, suggesting there's an overlay rather than an integration with the existing design of the arch in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the etched runes visible across the doorâ€™s surface consistent in depth, color, and lighting with the original carvings, and do they not cover or distort existing patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the addition of etched runes represents a new element not present in Image A. These runes contrast with the original carvings. The depth, color, and lighting of these additional etchings do not match that of the original carvings. Moreover, they visibly cover and potentially distort the original patterns on the door.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the cloak-like structure around the doorframe exhibit natural fabric folds with consistent lighting and shadow, and does it maintain connection to the original stone frame without gaps or distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cloak-like structure is represented by the feather elements of the wings, which don't have the characteristic folds of fabric but instead have feathery textures. The lighting and shadows appear to emanate from the feathers, which do not fit tightly into the stone frame. They neither maintain a natural fabric-like appearance nor exhibit a continuous and seamless connection to the original stone frame.",
    "answer": "No"
