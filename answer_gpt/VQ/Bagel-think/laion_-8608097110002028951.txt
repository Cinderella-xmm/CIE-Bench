    "Question": "Q1: Does the facade of the theater building appear composed of uniform tan LEGO bricks with brown accents, without visible seams, irregular patterns, or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the theater building's facade resembles LEGO bricks, characterized by its uniform tan color with red accents, mimicking the appearance of LEGO models. World knowledge of LEGO construction informs us that these components often come in specific colors and textures meant to resemble simplified brick constructions. The lack of visible seams or irregular patterns suggests a consistent application of LEGO brick textures in the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the three large arched windows replaced with translucent square LEGO-style panes that preserve the arch shape but feature a regular grid pattern, without distortion or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the windows using translucent square panes arranged in a grid pattern, consistent with LEGO construction techniques. These panes maintain the original arch shape, indicating accurate placement and alignment characteristic of LEGO-style models, without evident distortion or misalignment. World knowledge about LEGO designs supports this observation, as they generally ensure geometric precision and symmetry.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the 'Walgreens' and 'Marina Theater' signs show letters constructed from smooth red flat LEGO bricks, maintaining legibility and alignment with the awning structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the signage for 'Walgreens' and 'Marina Theater' is composed of red LEGO bricks, with the letters appearing smooth and flat. LEGO construction often uses bricks in fundamental shapes to form signage that is legible and aligned with underlying structures, maintaining overall design coherence. The edited image reflects these characteristics, ensuring readability and integration with the awning.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are both vintage cars rendered as blocky LEGO vehicles with simplified shapes, including rectangular bodies, circular wheels, and flat surfaces, without retaining realistic car features like curved fenders or chrome trim?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases vintage cars transformed into LEGO-style models, featuring blocky and simplified designs typical of LEGO vehicle sets. The cars have rectangular bodies and circular wheels with flat surfaces, lacking realistic car features like curved fenders or chrome accents. This reflects LEGO's representation style, which eschews detailed replication for simplicity in shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the LEGO-style cars and building maintain proper scale and alignment with each other and the surrounding environment, with no floating parts, misaligned bricks, or unnatural spacing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO-style elements of cars and buildings display consistent ratios and positioning indicative of LEGO modeling practices, which prioritize scale maintenance and proper alignment. The absence of floating components or irregular spacing suggests the edited image maintains this coherence, ensuring the vehicles and structures fit seamlessly within the environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
