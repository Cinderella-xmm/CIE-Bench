      "question": "Are the edges of the tiger’s face cleanly defined with uniform thickness and no pixelated or broken lines indicating poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger's face appears to be crafted from paper, indicative of a decorative or artistic representation. The edges of the paper are cleanly cut, showing uniform thickness and precise craftsmanship. The stripes and features on the face are outlined with uniform and clear lines, which are typical in well-made paper art. By analyzing these visual cues, we see that the edges are indeed cleanly defined and lack any pixelation or broken lines that would suggest poor rendering.",

      "question": "Do the exaggerated stripes and enlarged whiskers remain symmetrically aligned and proportionally consistent with the rest of the tiger’s facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger design features bold, exaggerated stripes as part of its artistic portrayal. These stripes follow a symmetrical pattern on the face, maintaining a proportional alignment with the rest of the facial features such as the eyes, nose, and whiskers. The enlarged whiskers match the artistic style and do not disrupt the overall symmetry of the design. Analyzing the design elements, they appear consistent and aligned symmetrically.",

      "question": "Are the kimono panels clearly separated into distinct layers with clean edges and no overlapping or floating segments that suggest improper layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a paper art figure dressed in a kimono. The visual cues show that the kimono panels are cut and colored in a way that suggests they are separate layers, each featuring a distinct shading pattern. The edges of these panels are cleanly defined, typical of precise paper crafts, avoiding any overlapping or misaligned sections. Therefore, assessing the sharpness and separation, the kimono panels exhibit proper layering without floating segments.",

      "question": "Do the gold foil elements exhibit consistent reflectivity and blend naturally with the surrounding floral pattern without harsh highlights or floating fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold foil elements are part of the surrounding decorative art pieces, possibly representing cards or panels. These elements display reflectivity that aligns with typical foil response to light, appearing consistent across the pieces. The foil integrates smoothly with the floral pattern and exhibits no harsh highlights or broken fragments. They maintain a natural and cohesive appearance with the surrounding art.",

      "question": "Are the detachable panels aligned with natural fold lines or garment seams and do they appear securely attached without floating or intersecting incorrectly with adjacent clothing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a paper craft design of a tiger in a kimono. The kimono panels, designed as paper segments, appear attached and aligned with fold lines that suggest garment seams. Due to the nature of paper crafts, these elements are securely attached and follow the expected placement without any indication of floating or misalignment within the garment design. Assessing the logical alignment and the paper crafting method, the panels seem to match the intended structure without intersection issues.",
