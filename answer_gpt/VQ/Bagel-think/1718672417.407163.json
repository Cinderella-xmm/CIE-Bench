      "question": "Are the braids on the alpaca’s neck and head seamlessly integrated with metallic ornaments and amulets without visible texture mismatches or broken strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the braids are adorned with metallic ornaments and amulets, which appear to be integrated well with the strands. There is no visible texture mismatch or broken strands, indicating a seamless integration. This conclusion is drawn from carefully observing the visual elements and ensuring consistency in texture and appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the newly added Norse-style garments around the alpaca’s body show coherent patterns and visible runic inscriptions without jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Norse-style garments on the alpaca in Image B exhibit coherent patterns and visible runic inscriptions. The edges are smooth, and there are no texture artifacts which suggests high-quality integration of visual elements. This observation relies on identifying consistent patterning and clear textural details in the image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the standing stones in the background positioned naturally within the forest scene, with proper scale, shadowing, and mist effects that match the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The standing stones in Image B are positioned in an open misty landscape rather than a forest scene as seen in Image A. They appear unnatural due to the absence of tree elements that match a forest setting. The mist effect is present, but the scene is inconsistent regarding the forest environment noted in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the metallic components and amulets in the braids anchored realistically, with no floating elements or unnatural angles that suggest poor integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic components and amulets within the braids appear to be well-anchored, with no elements appearing to float or present at unnatural angles. They seem to follow the natural flow of the braids, suggesting that they are realistically integrated.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the alpaca’s facial features, including eyes, nose, and mouth, proportionally correct and aligned with the rest of the head despite added accessories and styling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features of the alpaca in Image B, which include the eyes, nose, and mouth, appear proportionally correct and aligned with the rest of the head. The added accessories and styling do not interfere with the natural proportions of the alpaca's face, ensuring a coherent and realistic appearance.",
