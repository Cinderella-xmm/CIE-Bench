      "question": "Does the marbled ceramic finish on both vases display consistent, smooth patterns without visible texture breaks or artificial repetitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image of the vases shows a ceramic finish with varying shades and textures that resemble marble. The presence of distinct color patterns, particularly the gold leaf accents, contributes to the visual impression of complexity. Since marbled ceramic usually displays natural, organic patterns, the presence of smooth transitions between the different hues and textures suggests an absence of texture breaks or artificial repetitions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the branding decals applied to the vases clearly visible, proportionally sized, and aligned with the surface curvature without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the branding decals are actually applied to the packaging box, not directly on the vases. Evaluating the visibility and alignment, the decals on the packaging are proportionally sized and follow the box's surface without distortion. The absence of distortion suggests a precise application process that respects curvature and proportionality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the gold leaf accents on the vases show realistic highlights and edge definition consistent with metallic foil applied to curved surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image, the gold leaf accents on the vase feature highlights and edge definitions that give the impression of a metallic surface interacting with light. Realistic representations of metallic foil typically exhibit sharp edge details and light reflections consistent with the curvature of the object, suggesting authenticity in the depiction.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cross-sectional illustration on the packaging box accurately depicting the internal petal arrangement of the vases without geometric mismatch or incorrect layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a vase on the packaging box without an explicit cross-sectional illustration. Therefore, there cannot be any analysis regarding the internal petal arrangement or possible geometric mismatches concerning cross-sectional views.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bronze typography on the packaging box legible, evenly spaced, and free from blurring or unwanted shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the bronze typography appears on the packaging. The text is clear and legible, demonstrating no signs of blurring. The spacing between the letters appears even, and the typography is mostly free of unwanted shadows, ensuring visibility and readability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the two vases still symmetrical and proportionally accurate compared to the original, with no stretched or compressed sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing the edited vases in the second image with those in the original image, both sets of vases appear symmetrical and proportionally accurate. There is no indication of distortion, stretching, or compression. The consistent form suggests the edited vases retain the original symmetry and proportions.",
