      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility without any unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger possesses smooth textures and a cohesive appearance consistent with established chibi art styles. The design displays typical features of chibi characters with an enlarged head and simplified body proportions while maintaining clear detail work in its uniform patterns and expressions. Using knowledge of chibi designs, the tiger character fulfills all aspects of visual consistency and appeal without any noticeable texture flaws or missing details.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the whimsical park backdrop with soft pastel hues, cherry blossom trees, and rose petals appear photorealistic and integrate naturally with the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The whimsical park setting in Image B features pastel colors, cherry blossom trees, and dispersed petals in harmony with the chibi tiger’s playful design. The integration of background elements with the main subject is seamless within a cartoon environment, though it does not achieve photorealism. Instead, it achieves visual coherence and matches the thematic tone suitable for a cartoon depiction. Hence, while the design fits well aesthetically, labeling it as photorealistic doesn't align with the artistic intent.",

      "question": "Does the romantic floral arch in the distance enhance the scene naturally without introducing any obvious artifacts or disrupting the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the romantic floral archway serves as a complimentary background element that adds depth and enhances the whimsical park setting. The arch integrates into the scene smoothly, with consistent shading and texture relative to the rest of the image. There are no abrupt transitions or visual artifacts in the depiction of the arch, ensuring it contributes to the scene harmoniously and supports the overall visual narrative effectively.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger holding the skateboard realistic and does the action of holding the skateboard appear physically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering the exaggeration inherent in chibi art, Image B portrays the tiger with a relatively large head and small limbs typical of this art style. Despite these proportions, the depiction of the tiger grasping the skateboard seems physically plausible within the artistic context. The skateboard's size relative to the chibi tiger supports the illusion that it is held securely, maintaining internal coherence between the character’s actions and design proportions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a cohesive integration of all elements, from the chibi-style tiger to the vibrant background setting. This congruence supports the whimsical narrative of the artwork, with no visible artifacts or distortions detracting from its aesthetic quality. The entire composition sustains its authenticity within a cartoon aesthetic, ensuring that each element - be it the character or environment - aligns seamlessly, contributing to a harmonious whole.",
