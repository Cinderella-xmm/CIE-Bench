      "question": "Do the croissants, macarons, and cupcakes retain their natural texture and appearance after being incorporated into the treasure map design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects in question—the croissants, macarons, and cupcakes—are part of a stylized depiction and are rendered in a way that showcases their textures and shapes quite clearly. Based on visual cues in Image B, the croissants maintain a flaky and layered appearance typical of real-life croissants. The macarons and cupcakes also exhibit textures that are characteristic of their real counterparts, with the macarons showing smooth, round shapes and cupcakes exhibiting distinct frosting swirls. However, when we consider these elements within the constraints of a thematic map, they still resemble real objects rather than being stylized or abstracted beyond recognition. Therefore, Image B does show preservation of their natural texture and appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dotted trail leading to the frosting-shaped 'X' integrated smoothly without causing any unnatural textures or loss of detail on the surrounding desserts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dotted trail is composed of small, red berry-like elements leading to the 'X' marker made up of frosting elements. The integration appears carefully done; the trail does not disrupt the textures of the croissant or the cupcake, nor does it obscure their detail. Moreover, the dotted trail seems deliberately designed to align well with the dessert theme without causing any visual inconsistencies or loss of detail on the desserts themselves.",

      "question": "Do the sugar-coated compass rose and berries appear naturally placed and enhance the dessert-themed journey without looking out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the compass rose is designed with colorful points mimicking sugar sprinkles, and the berries serve as navigational markers. Within the map's thematic context, these elements do not appear out of place; they contribute to the playful and sweet interpretation of a treasure map centered around desserts. Their integration with the rest of the map elements—such as the desserts and the trail—appears harmonious and adds to the aesthetic without any obvious disparity or jarring effect.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the desserts consistent and realistic within the context of the treasure map, avoiding any distortion or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the desserts—croissants, macarons, and cupcakes—in various placements along the map. Each of these maintains proportions that are consistent with real-life representations, despite being slightly stylized to fit the map theme. There is no instant of extreme distortion or scaling that would make the objects appear unrealistic or out of context compared to how they might appear in reality.",

      "question": "Does the weathered parchment background integrate seamlessly with the desserts, preserving their fine details and avoiding any visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background is depicted as a weathered parchment, typical for treasure maps. The desserts placed atop this background show fine details, such as the flakiness of croissants and the smooth surface of macarons, without being affected negatively by the parchment texture. The integration seems intentionally designed to preserve fine detail, ensuring that the nuances of each dessert are visible and that there are no conflicting textures or visual artifacts that compromise their appearance.",
