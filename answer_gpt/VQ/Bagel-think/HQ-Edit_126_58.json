      "question": "Do the wing areas of the swan exhibit a consistent frosted glass texture that matches the lighting and translucency of the original ice material without visible seams or unnatural surface distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are transformed to resemble a frosted glass texture. Observing the wings, they maintain a consistent translucency reminiscent of glass, with a similar level of light refraction and reflection as one would expect from frosted glass or ice. There are no visible seams or distortions that would break the natural flow of the material's texture, suggesting a well-integrated design. In contrast, Image A depicts the wings with a pure ice texture, which complements the snowy setting without any glass-like elements. Comparing both images, the edited texture in Image B is visually coherent and faithful to the original material's style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the neck of the swan transformed into a glass stopper with a smooth, tapered shape that maintains proportional alignment with the body and does not exhibit unnatural bending, jagged edges, or volume inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swan's neck is elegantly transformed into a glass stopper, maintaining a smooth and graceful taper that aligns proportionately with the swan’s body. The visual cues indicate no unnatural bending or jagged edges, preserving the flow and integrity of the swan's neck transitioning into a stopper. The transformation retains proportional balance, combining swan form and bottle utility without inconsistency in volume. Image A's swan with a naturally curved neck offers a reference point for analyzing the proportions and smoothness in the edited version.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red, pink, and green decorative elements (such as pine branches and flowers) integrated into the base of the bottle in a way that avoids floating or disconnected positioning, and do they maintain natural color and texture without blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative elements, including the flower and greenery, are placed at the base of the bottle. They appear grounded and securely integrated, avoiding any perception of floating or inconsistency in positioning. The colors maintain their vibrancy and detail, without signs of blurring or pixelation, suggesting a natural incorporation into the scene. In Image A, similar decorative elements are neatly integrated, contributing to a realistic and seamless appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the \"Winter Glow\" text clearly visible, properly aligned with the bottle's curvature, and does the iridescent effect appear smooth and continuous without unnatural color fringes or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains text on the bottle that should be assessed for visibility and alignment. However, upon inspection, the visible text states 'Jlex Free,' rather than 'Winter Glow,' which indicates a deviation in labeling. While the text follows the bottle’s contours with no evident digital artifacts disrupting its appearance, the label does not match the expected phrase, which may lead to confusion regarding specific branding.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall shape of the transformed swan-bottle maintain structural coherence, with all parts proportionally aligned and without visible warping, stretching, or disjointed sections that break the continuity of the form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed swan-bottle in Image B maintains structural coherence throughout. All parts, including the wings, neck, and bottle body, are proportionally aligned and smoothly integrated. There are no visible warps, stretches, or disjointed sections, preserving the continuity of the swan's elegant form adapted to function as a decorative bottle. Compared to Image A’s swan sculpture, the transformed version remains faithful in maintaining proportion and flow within the new design context.",
