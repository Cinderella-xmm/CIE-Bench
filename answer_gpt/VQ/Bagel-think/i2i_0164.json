      "question": "Does the area on the train where people were previously sitting look natural without any obvious artifacts or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area on the train where individuals were previously sitting is now occupied by a conductor and a flag. The visual cues indicate no clear artifacts or gaps; the conductor and flag fit well within the space with no noticeable distortion or leftover elements from the removal process. The blending of newly added elements into their surroundings suggests a smooth and skillful editing process.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the conductor added atop the train well-integrated with the existing lighting and shadows, giving a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows the conductor positioned atop the train with lighting that matches the scene's overall lighting conditions. The color and shadow of the uniform are aligned with the ambient light, which is consistent with the sunlight direction. The shadows seem logical and are smoothly integrated, which suggests careful attention to the photo-editing process. The conductor does not appear to be improperly lit compared to other elements in the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the flag held by the conductor look natural, with proper proportions and a logical position relative to the train's motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flag in Image B stands upright next to the train with no distortion, maintaining proper proportions relative to the conductor and train. Its position aligns logically considering the perspective and motion direction of the train. Compositional elements such as direction and position are in conformity with those seen in the rest of the image, displaying consistency in movement dynamics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any distortions or misalignments in the train's structure near the area where people were removed, and the conductor was added?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the train structure where the conductor and flag were placed appears to maintain its integrity. No misalignments or distortions are evident in the lines or structure of the train, such as uneven edges, holes, or warping that could hint at editing errors. The elements added and removed were handled gingerly to ensure structural continuity.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the image remain balanced and stable after editing, with no noticeable shifts caused by the removal and addition of people?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the removal of multiple individuals and the addition of a conductor and a flag, the image's overall composition retains balance. The arrangement of elements across the image retains equilibrium; the train, conductor, and flag are harmonized logically within the scene guided by visual symmetry and design principles, preventing any perceptible composition imbalance.",
