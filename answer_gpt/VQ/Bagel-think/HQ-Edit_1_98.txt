    "Question": "Q4: Are the gold inlays on the violin positioned along logical contours of the instrument and do they exhibit consistent metallic sheen and reflection without appearing detached or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there appear to be no visible gold inlays on the violin. Without these components, this question cannot be answered accurately based on the observation. The violin's visually consistent appearance throughout means that if any gold inlays were present, they would fit along logical contours. Hence, based purely on the absence of visible gold elements in the violin, the response should be adjusted to reflect that their nonexistence results in no misalignment or inconsistency.",
