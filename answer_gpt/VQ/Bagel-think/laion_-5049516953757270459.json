    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the LEGO representation of the avocado half retain a smooth, curved appearance with consistent brick alignment along its edge, avoiding jagged or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the avocado half is represented using LEGO bricks. Given LEGO’s traditional design limitations, bricks often introduce angular and blocky features rather than smooth curves. The representation of the avocado does not retain a smooth and curved appearance, and exhibits jagged edges typical of LEGO construction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blueberries and raspberries represented with uniformly sized round LEGO bricks that maintain their individual spherical form without flattening or merging into irregular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "LEGO's use of bricks tends to flatten or create angular shapes because of its blocky nature. In Image B, the blueberries and raspberries are represented with bricks that do not completely capture the spherical form. Instead, they demonstrate the characteristic angularity of LEGO. The bricks do not fully maintain a spherical form for each fruit item.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the LEGO broccoli maintain a layered, tree-like branching structure with distinct florets, avoiding overly simplified or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli made from LEGO showcases a simplified version. While attempts are made to reflect a tree-like structure, LEGO tends to oversimplify with less detail. The broccoli does not maintain distinct florets and appears more simplified and geometric rather than visually detailed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the surface of the LEGO red bell pepper smoothly curved with tightly fitted bricks, showing no visible gaps or abrupt angular transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "LEGO construction with bricks usually features visible angular transitions and gaps due to their rigid shapes. In Image B, the red bell pepper is created with LEGO pieces, exhibiting visible angular transitions and lacks smooth curvature and tightly fitted bricks typically seen in realistic objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the outer edge of the LEGO heart-shaped board follow the exact contour of the original wooden board without deviations, breaks, or irregularities in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the LEGO board has edges defined by the limitations of block construction which introduces potential breaks and irregularities—specifically away from the smooth contours seen in wooden or other natural materials. The LEGO board does present deviations from a smooth contour.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the LEGO asparagus stalks aligned in parallel and bound together by a LEGO representation of twine, preserving the original bundle's structure and proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO asparagus stalks do appear aligned in parallel; however, there is no visible LEGO representation of twine binding them. The realistic structure is not well-preserved in terms of retaining binding detail with the LEGO.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the LEGO heart-shaped board placed on a uniform gray base with no visible shadows, highlights, or texture inconsistencies that suggest mismatched lighting or depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the LEGO heart-shaped board on a gray background which is uniform in color, but lacks consistent lighting and depth commonly seen in real environments. LEGO does not present shadows or texture inconsistencies but rather flattens the overall aesthetic. There are no lighting mismatches.",
