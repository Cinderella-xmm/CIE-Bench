    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the elements of the image, such as the elephant and its environment, unaltered and maintain their original natural appearance without any artifacts introduced in the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an evident addition of a plate with steak and vegetables in the foreground. This is an unnatural element for the setting and represents an artificial edit introduced to the image, indicating that not all elements maintain their original natural appearance.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the elements within the image appear natural and consistent with the original, such as the roughness of the elephantâ€™s skin and the details of the hay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of the plate with food has altered the visual consistency. The textures and materials of the steak, being unrelated to the natural environment of the elephant, introduce inconsistencies. The steak and carrots do not naturally blend with the environmental textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical features of the elephant and its surroundings, like the hay bale and enclosure, depicted accurately and without unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements such as the elephant and the enclosure appear to maintain their correct proportions and do not seem distorted. However, the introduced plate with food does appear slightly disproportionate or out-of-place for an enclosure setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details, such as the subtle lines and wrinkles on the elephant's skin and the strands of hay, been preserved without any degradation or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant's skin and the surrounding components like the hay appear to have preserved their detailed appearance. However, the introduction of the food item, particularly the steak and vegetables, adds unnatural textures which are inconsistent with the natural scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition of the image, including the placement of the elephant, the hay bale, and the enclosure, maintain visual credibility and alignment with the expected scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The natural elements of the elephant and its enclosure appear to be in credible positions and alignment. However, the addition of the food plate disrupts the composition, making the scene less visually credible within the expected environment of an elephant habitat.",
