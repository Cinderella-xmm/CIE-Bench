    "Question": "Q1: Does the ornate armor on the character's torso and limbs have consistent geometric structure and natural surface textures without visible distortion or broken edges?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the armor appears to have an intricate design, typical of medieval inspiration, with consistent geometric shapes. The texture is smooth, and there are no visible distortions or broken edges indicating well-shaped armor construction. This suggests attention to detail in both design and execution, maintaining visual coherence.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the velvet cape exhibit natural draping behavior with realistic folds and shadows, and does it avoid unnatural intersections or floating segments?",
    "explanation": "The cape in Image B falls elegantly around the character, displaying folds that follow the body's contours. The shadows emphasize the fabric's texture, creating a realistic depiction of velvet. There are no visible intersections or segments floating unnaturally, indicating good attention to fabric physics and draping.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the rolling hills and distant castle integrated smoothly into the scene with consistent lighting and shadow alignment, avoiding sharp edges or color discontinuities?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the landscape, including the hills and distant castle, is harmoniously integrated. The lighting and shadows are consistent across these elements, without sharp edges interrupting the view. The colors transition smoothly, supporting the scene's overall cohesion and realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the character’s right hand holding the scepter show five correctly shaped fingers with natural joint alignment and skin texture, without deformation or extra digits?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the character’s right hand displays five fingers that are naturally shaped with appropriate joint alignment. The skin texture is consistent, and there are no signs of deformity or extra fingers. This reflects anatomical accuracy and careful rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
