      "question": "Does the enlarged skirt maintain consistent lace texture and pattern without visible warping, tiling, or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the enlarged skirt is carefully observed for its lace texture and pattern. The lace appears consistent with delicate and intricate designs that do not exhibit signs of warping, tiling, or unnatural stretching. The flow and fall of the skirt seem natural and consistent in design, indicating that the editing process maintained the organic appearance of lace material.",

      "question": "Are the enhanced lace details consistent in thickness, spacing, and opacity with the original lace, and do they lack abrupt edges or synthetic-looking overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lace details in Image B maintain consistency in thickness, spacing, and opacity, similar to the original lace. There are no abrupt edges or synthetic-looking overlays; instead, the lace integrates smoothly into the overall dress fabric, suggesting attention to maintaining its authenticity during editing.",

      "question": "Do the added structural elements of the camper van conversion (e.g., side panels, windows) follow the car’s existing geometry and maintain consistent scale and perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camper van conversion appears natural, with the added structural elements harmoniously following the car's existing geometry. The scale of the side panels and windows adheres to the vehicle's proportions, maintaining consistent scale and perspective. This coherence suggests well-executed integration into the vehicle's form.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral paintings in Image B are applied elegantly across the car's surfaces, showing no signs of flatness, misalignment, or unnatural shadowing. The flowers' alignment follows the car's curves, ensuring that shadows and highlights remain natural relative to the lighting.",

      "question": "Is the kraft paper texture uniformly applied across the background without obscuring the subject or creating visible seams, and are the nautical borders contained within the image boundaries without cutting into the woman or car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kraft paper texture is evenly applied across the background. It does not obscure the subject, nor does it show visible seams. The nautical borders are neatly contained within the image boundaries and do not intrude upon the woman or the vehicle, maintaining the integrity of all elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadows in Image B are thoroughly checked, and they maintain alignment with the overhead sunlight source. There are no conflicting highlights or dark spots that appear out of place, indicating a cohesive blending of light across the original and edited features.",
