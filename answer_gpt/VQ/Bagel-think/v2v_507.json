      "question": "Are the elongated legs of the chibi tech mascot proportionally correct and structurally consistent with the rest of the body, avoiding any distortion or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi tech mascot’s legs are intentionally stylized, which is typical for chibi character designs. Chibi characters often have exaggerated proportions for artistic style, such as larger heads and smaller bodies, with legs sometimes elongated for effect. The legs in this case appear proportionally correct within this stylized context and show no signs of distortion or unnatural bending, thus maintaining consistency with traditional chibi styles.",
