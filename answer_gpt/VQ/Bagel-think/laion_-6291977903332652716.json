      "question": "Are the buildings and water surface inside the sphere free from unnatural bending or warping at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene inside the sphere shows model buildings and a miniature water surface, which are typically crafted to maintain consistency and realism given their scale. The buildings and water surface within a snow globe tend to be designed with care to avoid distortions that could arise from the shape of the globe. The visual cues in the image indicate no noticeable bending or warping, as the proportions of the buildings and water appear natural and consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wooden beams and stucco surfaces of the houses retain clear, natural textures without pixelation or repeating patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases detailed model buildings with visible wooden beams and stucco surfaces. In such crafted models, textures are often meticulously applied to mimic the real materials without pixelation or noticeable repeating patterns, which would detract from realism. The visual cues indicate that the model's surfaces have been textured effectively, maintaining clarity and authenticity.",

      "question": "Does the water surface show smooth, continuous reflections of the buildings and sky without excessive glare or broken mirror-like effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface is depicted in a snow globe, reflecting the model's elements. Craftsmanship in models like miniatures often ensures that water surfaces are balanced and consistent without excessive glare or broken reflections, which would conflict with the scaled atmosphere intended. The visual assessment shows that reflections are smooth and continuous, contributing to the sphere's charm.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the added mini bridges connected to both banks and do the plants grow from valid surfaces without appearing suspended in air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, a model within a snow globe, is likely designed to ensure elements like bridges are securely connected and plants appear to naturally arise from surfaces. The visual details show the bridge connects seamlessly with both banks, and plants are properly staged, enhancing the realistic portrayal expected in such models.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all visible characters have five fingers per hand, natural limb proportions, and clothing that conforms to body shape without clipping or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes miniature figurines that are often crafted to reflect human proportions and details, while scaled down. Craft models usually aim for accuracy in such details, ensuring natural hand digit count and limb proportions. Clothing is typically designed to fit figures without unnatural effects like clipping or floating. Observing the image, the characters appear to maintain consistent proportions and clothing details.",
