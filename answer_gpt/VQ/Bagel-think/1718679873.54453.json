      "question": "Does the miniature robot model retain accurate proportions and intact geometric shapes compared to the original robot, with no visible stretching, compression, or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature robot model appears to have proportions and geometric shapes that mirror the original design in Image A. The arms, legs, and torso maintain their relative sizes, with no visible distortions such as stretching or compression. The joints appear well-aligned, which supports the notion that the robot's proportions are intact and accurate.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the circular display case transparent and smooth, with natural light interaction and no jagged edges, double outlines, or artificial artifacts around its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular display case in Image B appears transparent and smooth with a clear view of the robot model. The interaction of light with its surface seems natural, reflecting a consistent circular shape without jagged edges or double outlines. There are no visible artifacts that would detract from its design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tiny gears visible under transparent panels correctly aligned with the robotâ€™s surface, uniformly detailed, and free from overlapping or floating anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows tiny gears that align well with the robot's surface. The detailing appears uniform, and the transparent panels display an acceptable integration with the robot's structure. There are no noticeable anomalies such as overlapping or floating parts which would suggest misalignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hexagonal base geometrically precise, with uniform edges and a consistent matte-black finish, and does the model number text appear sharp and evenly glowing without haloing or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hexagonal base looks geometrically precise with straight, uniform edges. The matte-black finish is consistent across the surface. The text displaying the model number is sharp with a uniform glow, showing no signs of haloing or distortion that could affect readability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the mini landscape surrounding the display include naturally scaled trees, ground textures, and distant cityscape elements that maintain spatial consistency with the size of the display case and model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mini landscape in Image B includes trees, ground textures, and cityscape elements that appear naturally scaled relative to the display case and the robot model. The spatial arrangement supports a consistent and realistic representation of these elements which harmonize with the overall miniature scale of the model.",
