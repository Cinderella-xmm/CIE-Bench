    "Question": "Q1: Are the hands enlarged but still anatomically correct with five fingers, natural joint positions, and no distorted shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hands appear to be cartoon-like, which gives the impression of possible enlargement. Despite this stylistic alteration, the hands do exhibit five fingers and maintain the natural joint positions typical of human anatomy. There are no evident signs of distortion like disproportionate finger lengths or awkward joint angles. Through the combination of visual cues and common anatomical knowledge, the hands are indeed enlarged but retain correct anatomical features.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the vine-patterned borders present along the edges of the image, following natural leaf and stem structures without overlapping or clipping into the main scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, decorative vine-patterned borders are clearly visible. They encapsulate the image without intruding into the central scene of the tea field and worker. The vines display typical structural features found in nature, resembling leaves and stems in a stylized manner, and they are positioned without any overlap or clipping into the main contents of the scene.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the recycled paper texture applied uniformly across the entire image without obscuring fine details such as the worker’s hair, clothing folds, or tea leaves?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there doesn't appear to be an overt application of a recycled paper texture over the entire image. The image retains clear detail in areas such as the worker's hair and clothing as well as the precision of the tea leaves, indicating no obstruction of fine details is present from paper texturing. The uniform clarity supports the conclusion that no such texture has been applied.",
    "answer": "No"
