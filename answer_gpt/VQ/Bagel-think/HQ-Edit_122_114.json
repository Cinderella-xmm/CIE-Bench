      "question": "Are the cogs and gears forming the nest properly aligned and interlocked, showing no visible gaps or floating elements that break geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows multiple gears and cogs incorporated around the stork’s nest area. Visually, these cogs appear to have been arranged without visible gaps between them, suggesting they are interlocked in a mechanically plausible manner. There are no obvious elements that appear to float or disrupt the geometric continuity normally seen in such mechanical constructions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the copper pipes run along the roof edges in a physically plausible manner, with consistent thickness and no abrupt bends or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Copper pipes are visible running along the edges of the roof in the edited image. Visually, they appear to maintain a consistent thickness and are aligned with the roof, suggesting a plausible physical integration. There are no abrupt bends or floating sections apparent, which supports their role as part of the mechanical theme of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the metallic plates covering the stork’s body arranged in a way that follows the underlying anatomy, without unnatural overlaps or gaps between plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the stork is covered with metallic plates that mimic mechanical armor. These are shown to follow the curves and lines of the stork’s body, suggesting an arrangement that respects the underlying anatomy. There are no visible overlaps or gaps between plates that would indicate an unnatural placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical joints at the stork’s neck, wing, and leg connections properly shaped and positioned to match the movement range of a real bird, without appearing distorted or misplaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the joints at the neck, wings, and legs of the mechanical stork in the edited image, these joints seem appropriately shaped and positioned in places that support movement akin to a real bird’s anatomy. The visual arrangement of these elements does not suggest distortion or misplacement, maintaining an overall plausible anatomy.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the integration of mechanical elements (cogs, pipes) with the wooden house maintain proportional harmony and avoid elements that appear disproportionately large or suspended without support?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a large array of mechanical elements incorporated into the structure of the house, such as cogs and pipes. These are proportionally sized relative to the house and the stork, maintaining a visual harmony. There are no elements that appear disproportionately large or suspended in a manner lacking support, which contributes to the plausibility of the edited design.",
