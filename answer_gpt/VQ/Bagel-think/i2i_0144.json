      "question": "Does the small flag reading 'Fresh' appear naturally placed on top of the sandwich without looking out of place or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small flag is inserted into the sandwich right through the top bun and the visible portion is the flag reading 'Fresh'. The flag does not appear distorted or out of place. Such flags are commonly used to denote freshness in food presentations. The edges of the bun around the flag are naturally indented, indicating that the flag was pushed through, which is expected when inserting a small object into a soft bun. Therefore, its placement appears natural.",

      "question": "Are the layers of the sandwich consistent after replacing the tomato slices with grilled pineapple, preserving the natural structure and layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grilled pineapple has been placed where the tomato slices were in Image A. The sandwich continues to have a top bun, turkey slices, lettuce, and now grilled pineapple. The grilled pineapple fits well within the layers, similar to how the tomato slices were originally positioned. The sandwich still shows layers from bottom to top, preserving its structure.",

      "question": "Does the small flag maintain its texture and detail, avoiding unnatural appearances or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flag is visible with the word 'Fresh' written on it. It appears clear and legible, with no visual artifacts like distortion, blurring, or color bleeding. The texture of the flag looks consistent with what one would expect from a small food label decoration, providing a defined and printed appearance.",

      "question": "Does the sandwich retain its structural coherence and visual plausibility after the edits, ensuring it looks authentic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich retains its overall structure, with the layers including the bun, lettuce, turkey slices, and replacement grilled pineapple still maintaining a cohesive visual stacking. The presence of the flag, showing 'Fresh', contributes to the visual authenticity regarding food presentation. The major edit, replacing tomatoes with grilled pineapple, does not disrupt the sandwich's integrity or make it look implausible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the grilled pineapple slices fit proportionally within the sandwich, maintaining a natural and realistic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grilled pineapple slices are placed where the tomato slices previously were. They appear to fit proportionally within the sandwich, as the slices are similar in size to those of the tomato, fitting well beneath the bun and above the other ingredients. The pineapple, being round and sliced, aligns well with the sandwich's layering, thus preserving the realistic appearance.",
