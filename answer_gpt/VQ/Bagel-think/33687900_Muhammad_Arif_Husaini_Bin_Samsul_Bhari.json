      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the crystalline hair of the water spirit follow the natural downward trajectory of the original waterfall, maintaining smooth, continuous flow lines that align with the surrounding rock contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water spirit's hair appears to flow in a downward direction, similar to the waterfall in Image A. The hair maintains a smooth, continuous look, resembling the natural flow of water. The lines are aligned with the surrounding rock contours, showing awareness of the natural formation in the background, thus capturing the essence of the waterfall flow presented in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the luminescent blue hue of the water spirit evenly distributed and softly blended into the surrounding gray and dark rock surfaces without sharp edges or unnatural color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water spirit's blue hue is bright and contrasts with the darker rocks in the background. However, the luminance is not softly blended into the surroundings, creating a distinct edge between the spirit and the environment. Thus, the transition is not as natural as it could be, indicating an unnatural color distribution.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vine-like appendages have consistent leaf shapes, spacing, and textures that match the surrounding vegetation, and do they grow naturally from the spirit’s body without floating or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vine-like appendages on the water spirit in Image B have a stylized form that does not match the realism of the surrounding vegetation in Image A. The leaves and spacing are not consistent with the natural texture or density of the real plants. Additionally, their growth is from the spirit itself, which doesn't match the surrounding flora’s natural rooting structure.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the glowing basin reflect light in a way that matches the direction of the falling water and surrounding environment, showing coherent wave patterns and no flat or uniform glow that contradicts natural light behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing basin beneath the spirit does not accurately reflect the directional light and wave patterns consistent with a natural water form seen in Image A. The glow appears uniform rather than patterned by environmental factors, thereby contradicting the natural behavior of water and light.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crystalline surfaces of the spirit composed of clear, defined facets with realistic light refraction and shadowing, avoiding pixelation, smudging, or repetitive patterns that suggest digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystalline surfaces on the water spirit in Image B are stylized but lack realistic refraction and shadowing akin to natural crystals. Some areas might appear smudged or repetitive, indicating digital artifacting rather than a clear, distinct crystalline structure with realistic light interaction.",
