      "question": "Are Mona Lisa's facial features, such as her eyes, nose, mouth, and smile, rendered naturally without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a blurred face area, so facial features like eyes, nose, mouth, and smile are not discernible. Therefore, it cannot establish evidence of naturally rendered features without artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the color adaptation around Mona Lisa preserve structural coherence and avoid unnatural color blending or edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image in Studio Ghibli style maintains structural coherence around Mona Lisa's dress and hands, with smoothly blended colors. The transition between different elements appears natural and avoids any harsh or unnatural blending of colors or edges.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited background in Studio Ghibli style retain its visual plausibility and avoid breaking the geometric shapes seen in the original painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is transformed to resemble Studio Ghibli's style, which generally leans towards fantastical and whimsical interpretations. While the colors and artistic style differ, the general landscape structure is still present without breaking geometric shapes from the original painting, maintaining visual plausibility within the chosen artistic style.",

      "question": "Are the textures and folds of Mona Lisa's dress depicted in a way that avoids unnatural patterns and maintains a realistic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Mona Lisa's dress adapts to a simpler, smooth animation style typical of Studio Ghibli. While less intricate than the original painting, the dress's portrayal avoids unnatural patterns, maintaining a stylistically consistent appearance that fits the animation genre while keeping realism relative to the art form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Mona Lisaâ€™s hands are depicted in a similarly positioned and ergonomic manner as seen in Image A. Both hands have the correct number of fingers, and the posture is consistent with a natural resting pose characteristic of the original painting.",
