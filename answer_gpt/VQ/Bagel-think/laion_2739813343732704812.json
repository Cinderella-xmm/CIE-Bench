      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pelican's beak elongated but still attached naturally to the head without bending or breaking at the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's beak is depicted in a stylized, cartoonish manner that is consistent with a two-dimensional design. It maintains its elongation and attachment to the head, without any visible bending or breaking at the base. This style is typical in illustrations where simplification and stylization are used.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the pelican’s feathers display visible layered texture despite being colored in pastel shades, without appearing uniformly smooth or pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feathers of the pelican are shown with a texture that mimics layering, evident in the use of lines and patterns despite the pastel colors. This gives the appearance of texture, as opposed to a smooth or pixelated surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the sailor hat positioned securely on the pelican’s head without overlapping the neck or appearing detached from the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sailor hat in Image B is situated atop the pelican’s head, fitting well without overlapping the neck. It appears to be placed securely, suggesting an intentional design choice fit for a cartoon or magnet style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wooden plank background extend evenly behind the pelican without visible seams or inconsistencies in wood grain or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a textured wooden surface that runs evenly across, offering a consistent appearance in the wood grain and color. This background choice supports a coherent design element, typical for such illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pelican’s legs and feet proportionally aligned with the body and not distorted or bent in an unnatural way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican’s legs and feet are simplified, matching the stylized nature of the rest of the body. They are portrayed proportionally in line with the body structure common to cartoon depictions, without appearing distorted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the pelican appear as a flat, two-dimensional object with minimal depth cues and clean edges, consistent with a magnet design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pelican in Image B presents as a flat, two-dimensional illustration with precise outlines and minimal shading or depth cues, akin to designs intended for magnets or stickers.",
