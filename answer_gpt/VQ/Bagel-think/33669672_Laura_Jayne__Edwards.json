    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the limbs proportionally elongated without visible kinks, unnatural bends, or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs appear proportionally elongated and maintain a smooth, continuous form without visible kinks or unnatural bends. The metallic sheen enhances the fluidity of the limbs, making them appear as a single, connected entity. The extended arm and leg are straight and exhibit natural extensions, implying a cohesive and uninterrupted portrayal of anatomy.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the boots and leg areas uniformly applied with clean edges and no overlapping or fragmented sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire figure including boots and leg areas exhibit a uniform metallic finish and no visible fragmented sections or irregularities. The edited image gives the impression of a clean and seamless integration of geometric patterns, thanks to the shiny and unified texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all body parts, including the skin, dress, and boots, display a consistent metallic sheen with smooth gradients and no patches of mismatched material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a consistent metallic sheen throughout the figure, including skin, dress, and boots. The sheen is even and smooth, with no visible inconsistencies or patches that would suggest a mismatch in material. This creates a cohesive appearance across all body parts, suggesting a unified metallic transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the color palette limited to metallic tones and turquoise, with no unexpected color bleed or desaturation in the figure or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette is consistently maintained, with the primary colors being metallic tones and turquoise. There are no signs of color bleed or desaturation, as the metallic gold-like finish contrasts sharply and harmoniously with the turquoise background, providing a clean and defined visual experience.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the figure's pose maintain natural weight distribution and joint angles, with no floating limbs or unnatural overlaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a natural pose with appropriate weight distribution and joint angles. The limbs appear connected seamlessly to the body without suggesting any floating or awkward positioning. The silhouette suggests a coherent and dynamically balanced pose, reflective of a naturally distributed weight and articulation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the extended hand have exactly five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, without extra digits or fused joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the extended hand is depicted with five fingers, all sporting natural spacing and curvature. There are no extra digits or signs of fused joints. The anatomical accuracy of the hand is preserved within the style and constraints of the metallic representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
