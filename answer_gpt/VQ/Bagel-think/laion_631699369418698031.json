      "question": "Is the cylindrical glass dome fully enclosing the totem pole without visible clipping, jagged edges, or unnatural transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears to be a smooth, continuous surface that fully encloses the totem pole. The edges of the glass dome are curved and do not display any jaggedness or clipping artifacts. Its transparency seems natural, with appropriate reflections and refractions as one would expect in a real glass dome. This impression is based on the smooth contours and realistic shine on the glass observed in the image.",

      "question": "Are the ferns and moss at the base of the totem grounded and proportionally sized, with no floating or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ferns and moss are placed at the base of the totem and appear to be integrated well with the surrounding soil. Their placement seems natural, at the appropriate scale relative to the totem. The elements do not appear to float or show any visual misalignment. This conclusion is drawn from the consistent shading and overlapping elements observed between the ferns, moss, and the ground.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly perched on the top of the totem with correct scale, natural wing shape, and no deformation of the totem’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly is depicted as being perched near the totem in Image B. The scale of the butterfly is appropriate in comparison to the totem, and the wings are well-shaped and proportioned, appearing natural. There is no visible deformation of the totem structure where the butterfly is located. These observations are based on the visual harmony and proportionate sizing of the butterfly relative to the totem.",

      "question": "Do the ferns, moss, and butterfly use natural green tones that harmonize with the wood color of the totem without unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ferns and moss are depicted in natural shades of green that seem harmonious with the wooden tones of the totem. The butterfly’s colors are vibrant but still complement the overall color palette, suggesting a natural setting. The consistency in color tones indicates no unnatural color shifts or disharmony. This analysis is based on the evident color balance and natural blending of these elements within the image.",

      "question": "Are all carved facial features and wood grain details on the totem clearly visible and undistorted after editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows clearly defined carved facial features and wood grain details on the totem. Despite the editing, the features remain sharp and undistorted, preserving the intricacies of the totem's design. The clarity and definition of these features suggest careful editing that maintained the totem's original details. This judgment is based on the visible sharpness and texture details evident in the image.",
