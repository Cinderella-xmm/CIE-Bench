      "question": "Does the pastel purple fur with teal accents maintain natural fur texture and gradient transitions across the body, particularly on the tail and back, without visible color blocking or artificial smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel is depicted with a highly stylized, cartoonish color scheme of pastel purple with teal accents. Cartoon designs typically exaggerate colors and simplify textures, leading to less natural fur appearance. Natural fur textures have a gradient and subtle changes, which are often replaced with more uniform colors in cartoon styles. The colors in Image B are bold and consistent across the fur, suggesting artificial smoothing rather than natural fur transitions. This creative choice aligns with the artistic intent rather than realistic depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the backpack positioned correctly on the squirrel’s back without deforming its posture or causing unnatural bulges in the fur, and does it display consistent material texture and shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backpack on the squirrel in Image B is drawn to fit the stylized aesthetic of the scene. Positioned naturally against the body, it doesn't cause visible deformation in posture or fur, which is typical for cartoon illustrations. The backpack displays uniform coloring and shadowing, matching the cartoon style and appearing consistent with the overall texture of the image, suggesting no unnatural bulges or inconsistencies in material representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glasses positioned symmetrically over the squirrel’s eyes with proper reflection details and soft shadows, and do they not distort the eye area or appear disproportionately large?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glasses in Image B are symmetrically placed on the squirrel's face and are drawn to fit the cartoon style. In animation or illustration, oversized glasses or exaggerated features often enhance character expression, but in this case, they remain proportionate to the squirrel's face and do not distort the eye area. The reflections and shadows are stylized but appear consistent with cartoon details.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the integration of the squirrel into the new forest background seamless, with no visible edge artifacts, mismatched lighting, or floating elements around the feet and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A cartoon illustration such as Image B is designed with cohesive elements across the background and main subject. The squirrel is integrated into the forest scene with a style matching the background, including consistent use of lighting and colors. The edges are smooth with no visible artifacts, and the tail and feet are placed in accordance with the ground elements, ensuring coherence in depth and perspective.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cartoonish flowers and mushrooms positioned at plausible distances from the squirrel, showing correct occlusion and depth cues, and do they have consistent textures and shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flowers and mushrooms in Image B are drawn in a cartoon style, positioned logically around the squirrel with visually consistent occlusion and depth cues. The positioning suggests varying distances, creating a sense of depth consistent with cartoon environments. Textures and shading are uniform, maintaining harmony with the overall scene style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the title banner positioned above the squirrel at a reasonable height, with legible text and soft shadows that match the scene’s lighting, without overlapping key elements like the squirrel’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title banner in Image B is positioned at an appropriate height above the squirrel, ensuring it does not interfere with the main subject's head or other key features. The text is legible with shadows that align with the scene's lighting, offering a coherent visual and maintaining the aesthetics of a cartoon illustration.",
