        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Art Nouveau embellishment introduces intricate linework and colors to the bird. The embellishment interacts with the palm's creases but they seem naturally integrated, as the lines and colors do not appear overly sharp or disturbed by the palm's textures. The design respects the contour and depth of the palm, avoiding any evident clash between the embellishment and the skin surface.",
