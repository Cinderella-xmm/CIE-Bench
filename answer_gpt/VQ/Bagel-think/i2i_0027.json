    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the dog's body maintain a natural and structurally consistent pose in the chibi-style, without any noticeable distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the dog's body appears to be distorted due to the blurred edit. The visual cues suggest a chibi-style approach, but crucial details such as the limbs or tail are obscured by the blur. Such heavy blurring introduces significant deformation and prevents a natural depiction of the dog's body, suggesting an inconsistent pose.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the enlarged head been integrated naturally into the image, without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred area encases any enlarged head, making it impossible to directly assess integration quality due to lack of visibility. This obscured visualization introduces potential artifacts and discontinuity with a chibi-style approach as the texture overlaps with the blur.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tennis ball touching the dog's nose in a way that looks natural and physically plausible, without any awkward positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball's position remains forward from what might be the dog's nose, but the excessive blur prevents exact positioning visibility. It's unclear whether any contact occurs, thus posing plausibility issues.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the relief tennis ball pattern on the base match well with the rest of the scene, contributing to a cohesive and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a minimal view of the scene and excessive blur over key details, reducing the ability to discern tennis ball patterns. Without clear visualization, matching coherence is contested as the blurred view undermines scene consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the edited image retained the original focus on the ball while successfully integrating the chibi-style elements, resulting in a balanced and visually coherent composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The heavy blur over the dog's chibi head diminishes the focus on the tennis ball. The blur disrupts integration efforts and detracts from visual coherency, affecting balance between original elements versus new style incorporation.",
