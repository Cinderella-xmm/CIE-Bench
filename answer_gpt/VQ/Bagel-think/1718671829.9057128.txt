    "Question": "Q1: Are the wooden beams and roof supports rendered as consistent geometric shapes with sharp, clean edges and no warped or fractured sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden beams and roof supports are stylized with bold lines and abstract forms. The edges are sharp and consistent, as geometric abstraction often emphasizes clean, distinct lines without realistic textures or imperfections. Observing Image B, we see consistent geometric patterns, which typically lack irregularities or warped sections, conforming to the expectation of geometric abstraction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the moon a perfectly round shape with a smooth surface and uniform glow around its edge, without jagged outlines or uneven brightness?",
    "explanation": "The moon in Image B is stylized as a circular shape with a uniform glow. In geometric abstraction, objects are often rendered in clean, idealized forms. The visual cues indicate that it is a solid circle with a consistent brightness. Thus, it represents a conceptual and geometric ideal rather than realistic imperfections, such as jagged outlines.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the plants in the foreground and background arranged in symmetrical, repeating patterns without irregular spacing or fragmented shapes?",
    "explanation": "Image B stylizes the plants in the foreground and background in an abstract manner. They are presented with geometric and symmetrical motifs which imply intentional artistry over random natural variance. In this case, the regular patterns and stylized forms suggest symmetry and repetition without irregular spacing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the wooden surfaces and glass panes display metallic gold and silver accents with consistent sheen and reflection, without color bleeding or missing texture details?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces are stylized with gold and silver hues as part of the abstract color scheme, showing consistent sheen typical in artistic renditions. The abstraction often prioritizes bold, clear color choices over realistic textures, maintaining consistent gold and silver accents inherent to geometric styles and reflecting vibrant colors without bleeding.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the stylized clouds positioned above the horizon with smooth, flowing outlines and do the window frames show bold, angular lines that align with the architectural style without breaking the windowâ€™s structural integrity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized clouds appear above the horizon with smooth, flowing curves indicative of geometric abstraction, which lends itself to simplified, flowing shapes. The window frames in Image B display angular lines consistent with the architecture, showing bold lines indicative of this style that maintain visual integrity without being compromised in structural depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
