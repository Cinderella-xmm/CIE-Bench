      ],

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gold scrollwork patterns on the lid continuous, symmetrical, and proportionally similar to the decorative elements on the key’s bow, without any jagged edges or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scrollwork on the lid appears to be well-crafted with continuous, smooth curves and symmetrical designs that match the aesthetic of the key’s bow. The patterns are proportionally similar and do not show any jagged edges or segments missing from the design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the satin compartment visibly smooth with soft highlights and gentle folds, and does the key sit flush within it without gaps or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior satin lining is depicted as smooth with subtle highlights indicating a gentle, soft texture typical of satin fabric. The folds appear natural and the key is seated such that it appears to rest directly on the fabric without visual gaps or floating, giving the impression of it being flush with the liner.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the embossed text “Eternal Elegance” clearly legible, evenly raised, and rendered with a metallic luster that matches the gold tone and reflectivity of the key and scrollwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text inside the box reads as 'Erale-Tlianet Elopese,' and appears clearly raised but does not match standard legibility nor the intended text 'Eternal Elegance.' Moreover, the metallic luster and reflectivity appear consistent with the surrounding gold elements, yet the text does not align with the expectations set by the description.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental details of the key are clearly depicted with sharp definition. The loops, bead-like protrusions, and shaft ridges are presented in a precise manner, maintaining clarity and quality without evident blurring, warping, or pixelation.",
