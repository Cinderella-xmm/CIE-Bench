      "question": "Does the surface of the mannequin's body exhibit a consistent weathered stone texture throughout, without patches of remaining metallic sheen or abrupt material changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire surface of the object, which appears to be a stone sculpture, has a unified texture resembling weathered stone. This texture is uniform across the mannequin's body without visible patches suggesting a different material like metallic sheen. The visual cue of rough stone texture is consistently applied, which is common in stone sculptures exhibiting weathering over time.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral and paisley patterns on the saree clearly visible as raised carvings on the stone surface, maintaining their original shape, symmetry, and spatial arrangement without blurring or geometric deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carved floral and paisley patterns on the saree are distinctly visible as raised designs, maintaining their intricate detailing. The stone texture slightly blurs and roughens the normally sharp edges seen in woven patterns but does not distort their shape or symmetry enough to lose recognition. This reflects how stone carvings often preserve the essential geometry of the designs they emulate.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mannequinâ€™s pose proportionally correct and structurally stable, with limbs positioned in a way that aligns with classical Indian sculpture conventions (e.g., slight tilt of head, bent elbow, relaxed hand placement) without unnatural bending or floating limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pose of the mannequin follows the classical Indian sculpture style, exhibiting a natural and structurally stable posture. The positioning of the limbs, including the bent elbow and relaxed hand placement, aligns with traditional artistic conventions. There are no irregularities such as unnatural bends or limbs appearing disjointed, allowing it to conform to the expected gracefulness in such sculptures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the necklace and bangle rendered as three-dimensional stone carvings with defined edges and depth, matching their original positions and proportions, and free from ghosting or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the necklace and bangle appear as raised stone carvings, maintaining their original three-dimensional form. These elements have defined edges and appear to match the positioning and proportions seen typically on a mannequin dressed with ornaments. They do not show ghosting effects or misplaced parts, which are critical elements in translating textile ornaments into carved stone.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the folds of the saree and contours of the body show subtle signs of weathering such as surface pitting, uneven texture, and shadowed crevices, without distorting the overall shape or creating artificial highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the folds of the saree and the body's contours exhibit signs of weathering consistent with stone sculptures, such as surface pitting and uneven textures typically caused by exposure over time. These details introduce natural depth through shadowed crevices while preserving the overall form. The presence of these subtle weathering cues enhances realism without causing distortion in the form of the statue.",
