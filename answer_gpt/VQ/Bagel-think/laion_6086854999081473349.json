    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the bark textures on the logs continuous and aligned with the original log shapes, showing no abrupt edges or inconsistent scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bark textures are designed to blend into the log shapes. This means that the textures should follow the curvature and natural alignment of the logs, fitting along their original path. In this image, the bark patterns are artistically modified around glowing features, but generally maintain alignment with the log curves without abrupt inconsistencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glowing amber eyes fit precisely within the original window openings without distorting the surrounding log structure or spreading light beyond the intended area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing amber eyes are bright and stand out visually. For them to fit 'precisely,' they should appear within the window spaces without altering the size or shape of the logs around them. In the edited image, there's an artistic light effect, but it appears the eyes directly correspond to the openings and do not excessively distort or spread.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the leafy canopy extend upward from the roof ridge in a natural, gravity-consistent manner, with leaves overlapping logically and not appearing suspended or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the leafy canopy in Image B, a natural extension implies gravity should pull the leaves down, overlapping as they grow from the ridge. The image shows leaves extending logically from the roof ridge, maintaining a natural appearance without appearing detached or suspended in air.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the vines and moss growing along the logs and roofline in a way that follows natural climbing patterns, with no flat, disconnected patches or unnatural straight lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, vines and moss should typically follow the contours of the logs and roofline, exhibiting climbing patterns that mimic real-life growth. They should not have flat or straight lines since natural growth tends to adapt to surfaces. The edited image shows the vines and moss wrapping around the structure without unnatural straight lines.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the runes carved into the logs with consistent depth and alignment, following the roundness of the logs and not appearing as flat or misaligned symbols?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Runes etched into logs should show consistent carving depth and should curve naturally to align with the round shape of the logs. In Image B, the runes seem to exhibit proper depth and follow the curvature, although stylistically modified, they don't appear misaligned or flat.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the forest spirit faces positioned within the original garage door frames, with facial features properly scaled and energy trails flowing outward in a smooth, non-jagged manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning within the garage door frames means the faces should fit 'within' those spaces without abrupt scaling issues. The energy trails should ideally follow smooth curves. Image B modifies these features but manages to keep the scale proportional within the frames with energy trails flowing smoothly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all structural components (logs, roof, canopy, vines, faces) connected seamlessly without gaps, floating elements, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For seamless connection, these components should visually integrate without gaps or floating elements. Image B creatively blends artistic elements while maintaining structural integrity without visible distortion or gaps between components.",
