      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style character maintain proper proportions and avoid unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D chibi-style character is characterized by exaggerated proportions, such as a larger head relative to the body, which is typical for this style. In Image B, the character maintains these proportions without exhibiting any unnatural geometric distortions, as the limbs and body conform to the expected chibi proportions. Therefore, the proportions are appropriate and consistent with this stylistic approach.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The landscape in Image B uses warm, golden hues similar to Image A, consistent with a desert or rocky environment. This maintains the surreal quality of the original, without introducing discordant colors or textures. Image B successfully preserves the warmth and consistent coloration of the scene.",

      "question": "Does the interaction between the 3D chibi-style character and the echidna appear natural and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character and the echidna are positioned naturally, with a clear focus on the interaction. The character's stance is straightforward, and the echidna is positioned in a typical manner, maintaining natural perspectives without distortion. The interaction avoids unnatural positions or scale mismatches, making it appear believable within the scene.",

      "question": "Do the clothing and accessories of the 3D chibi-style character retain their fine details without unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character's clothing and accessories in Image B are detailed appropriately for the 3D chibi style, with clear edges and textures that suit the design. There are no signs of unnatural textures, and the components like clothing folds and belt details are well-defined and consistent, ensuring a coherent look.",

      "question": "Is the confident pose of the 3D chibi-style character structurally consistent and visually credible within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pose of the character in Image B reflects a confident stance, with hands on hips and a solid footing. This pose is visually credible within the scene due to the balanced proportions and posture common in 3D chibi designs. The pose is well-suited to the context and the stylized approach of the image.",
