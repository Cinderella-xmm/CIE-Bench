      "question": "Do the anthropomorphic cardinal and blue jay have proportionally correct limbs and body structures that maintain anatomical plausibility without visible deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal and blue jay are presented in a stylized, anthropomorphic manner within a miniature stage-like setting. Despite this stylization, the proportions of the birds are consistent with their real-life counterparts. There are no visible deformations, and their body structures maintain anatomical plausibility given the artistic context. The limbs (legs) are depicted in a way that suits the style whilst maintaining believable proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Victorian garments worn by the cardinal and blue jay rendered with clear, consistent texture and stitching, free from pixelation, blurring, or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no Victorian garments present on the cardinal and blue jay. They are stylized but maintain a natural appearance without any clothing. Thus, the question is not applicable since there are no Victorian garments depicted.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the miniature stage and alcove elements positioned with proper depth and alignment, and do icicles and pine accents adhere to gravitational and spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stage and alcove elements are unified, with each bird occupying a well-defined space. The icicles and pine elements adhere to gravitational norms by hanging downwards and resting naturally, which creates a realistic representation of physics and spatial logic. The overall composition suggests proper depth and alignment within the scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all miniature seasonal elements (e.g., ornaments, snowflakes) properly scaled, cast realistic shadows, and aligned with the lighting direction of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seasonal elements such as ornaments and snowflakes are well integrated into the scene. They appear to be properly scaled relative to the birds and the background, and cast shadows consistent with the general lighting of the scene. The light source comes from the right, illuminating the elements realistically and maintaining the alignment with the overall scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the split-frame border clean and seamless, with no visible artifacts, distortion, or color bleeding at the boundary between the two scenes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the scene not as a split-frame, but rather as a unified stage-like setting with separate alcoves for each bird, divided by a central partition. The border inside the miniature box aligns seamlessly with the structure, without visible artifacts or distortion. The transition between sections is clear and cohesive.",
