      "question": "Is the head proportionally enlarged but still geometrically consistent with the neck and shoulders, without unnatural stretching or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is stylized in a chibi form where the head is typically enlarged compared to the body. This style increases the head size while maintaining a cute, proportionate look. The neck and shoulders appear consistent with this style, without any unnatural distortion. The geometric proportions fall in line with common chibi aesthetics, resulting in a natural and expected appearance despite the exaggerated features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the body, dress, and hair uniformly rendered with a soft rubber texture, free from conflicting textures or glossy reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the character in a keychain format, focusing on uniformity in texture. The surfaces of the body, dress, and hair all seem to be treated with a matte finish typical of soft rubber keychains. There are no visible glossy reflections or conflicting textures that could disrupt the material's consistency. This suggests a deliberate design considering a soft touch finish throughout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red boots and lace dress clearly identifiable with preserved structural details such as buckles, stitching, and knit patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clearly visible details on both the red boots and the lace dress. The boots show buckles and possibly some texturing indicative of stitching, while the dress retains a semblance of knit patterning. These details ensure that the keychain keeps the recognizability of the original clothing, albeit in a simplified form suitable for its scale.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bent posture maintain anatomical alignment of the spine, hips, and knees without unnatural angles or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image has a stylized figure in a consistent posture, bending with appropriate alignment throughout the body. The transition from the spine through the hips and knees respects the cartoonish style without implying unrealistic angles or misalignments. This suggests an intentional preservation of natural body mechanics albeit in a stylized form.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the silver keyring visibly connected to the character without gaps or overlapping edges, and does the wooden plank background show consistent texture and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the keychain (Image B), the silver keyring is firmly attached to the figure, showing smooth continuity without apparent gaps or overlapping edges at the interface. The wooden plank background under the flat keychain maintains a consistent texture and spacing, simulating a wooden surface without visual disruptions, reinforcing completeness in its design.",
