      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transition between the original elements (birds and branch) and the new background (starry night sky and moon) appear seamless without any unnatural artifacts or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds and the branch are set against a starry night sky with a crescent moon. Upon examining the boundaries and edges where these elements meet the new background, no visible artifacts or inconsistencies are noted that would disrupt the transition. This seamlessness suggests well-executed integration. The birds and branch appear naturally placed within the starry context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors and lighting of the starry night sky consistent with the rest of the image, and do they not introduce any unnatural artifacts or conflicting light sources?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette of the night sky in Image B includes deep blues and blacks typical of a starry backdrop, with twinkling stars and a moon providing potential light sources. The lighting on the birds and branches does not exhibit any anomalies or conflicting light sources. The colors of the birds and leaves retain their natural vibrance without clashing with the night theme, suggesting harmonious color merging.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the placement and appearance of the new moon natural within the context of the night sky, and does it not appear out of place or overly bright compared to the stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon viewing Image B, the crescent moon is positioned appropriately in the sky. Its brightness is consistent with a subtle moon, not overpowering, and it harmonizes with the surrounding stars. The moon's appearance does not outshine or negatively affect the night sky's overall ambiance, fitting naturally within the scene.",

      "question": "Do the birds retain their detailed features, texture, and proportions after the background change, showing no signs of distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detailed features of the birds, such as plumage, coloring, and proportions, remain intact. There are no visible distortions or loss in texture and detail even after changing the background to a starry night, indicating a successful editing process that preserved the original elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tree branch and leaves appear naturally lit and integrate seamlessly with the starry night sky, without any obvious inconsistencies in shadowing or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting on the branch and leaves in Image B aligns with the surrounding background. Though the scene is now set at night, the light reflections and shadows on these elements do not appear out of place. There are no glaring inconsistencies in how they catch and reflect light in relation to the night sky, indicating a well-integrated assembly.",
