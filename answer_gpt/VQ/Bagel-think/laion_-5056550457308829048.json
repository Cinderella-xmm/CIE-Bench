      "question": "Does the basketball motif on Patrick’s shirt appear seamlessly integrated with the fabric texture, without visible seams, jagged edges, or unnatural color blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Patrick's shirt features a yellow basketball motif that seems to stand out rather than blend with the texture of the shirt. The integration appears superficial, as the graphic does not exhibit a natural blending with any fabric texture, potentially showcasing visible edges where it meets Patrick's shirt. This indicates a lack of seamless integration.",

      "question": "Are SpongeBob’s sneakers proportionally accurate and do they feature a clear, consistent cereal loop pattern without distortion or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, SpongeBob is wearing sneakers with a cereal loop design. The sneakers do not appear accurate in terms of proportion to his body, as they seem oversized. The design includes cereal loops, but the pattern may lack consistency and could exhibit some distortion. Additionally, there is an unnatural sheen giving a polished look, which is atypical for fabric-like textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cereal hoops surrounding the characters have consistent circular shapes, appropriate size relative to the figures, and realistic lighting and shadowing that match the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cereal hoops have varied circular shapes, with some inconsistency in their form. The size of these hoops compared to the characters feels disproportionate, and the lighting does not seem to appropriately match the scene, lacking realistic shadowing, which results in an unnatural floating appearance. These factors detract from a cohesive look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the urban sports background with graffiti elements stylistically consistent with the characters and free from obvious texture mismatches, such as sharp edges, incorrect lighting, or unnatural surface details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background attempts to showcase an urban sports theme with graffiti. The style and color palette of the background are bold and vibrant, echoing the character designs and colors with an overall cartoon-like aesthetic. However, there's noticeable contrast due to potential mismatches in texture or lighting that don't fully integrate with the characters, leading to an inconsistency in visual unity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title “Basketball Breakfast Blitz!” clearly readable, properly aligned at the top of the image, and free from blurring, shadow artifacts, or overlapping with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Kasntense Farde Beist Bpsi!' is present instead of 'Basketball Breakfast Blitz!', and it occupies a prominent position at the top, resembling a title. However, the words are stylized with heavy contrast, potentially obscuring readability and leading to confusion. The alignment appears intentional. There are no serious signs of overlap or shadow artifacts affecting readability, though it's worth noting the choice of typography may impact clarity.",
