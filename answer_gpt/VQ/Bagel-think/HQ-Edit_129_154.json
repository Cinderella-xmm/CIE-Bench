    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the crown-like head formed from the lid free of distorted edges or broken geometry, and does it maintain a consistent metallic surface with the original teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic element corresponding to the teapot's lid has been transformed into a crown-like head on the owl. The design retains the intricate engraving seen in the teapot's lid, such as the ornamental detailing and metallic sheen. The geometry appears smooth and consistent without noticeable distortions. This observation suggests that the transformation processes effectively preserved the object's original features, maintaining a continuous and cohesive metal surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the spout-to-beak transformation maintain a smooth, continuous metallic surface without cracks, unnatural bends, or texture discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spout has been transformed into the beak of the owl. Analyzing the visual elements, the beak maintains a cohesive and continuous metallic appearance, free from any cracks or texture inconsistencies. The transition from spout to beak appears natural, suggesting a smooth and seamless adaptation of the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tail formed from the handle smoothly curved and proportionally aligned with the body, without abrupt angles or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle of the teapot is now the tail of the owl. This new configuration showcases a smoothly curved tail, which visually aligns well with the owl's body. The tail maintains the consistent metallic texture seen in the original object, and there are no visible abrupt angles or material inconsistencies, confirming a well-executed transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical eyes positioned symmetrically on the head, with visible cogs and soft glow that do not cause halos, color bleeding, or texture mismatch with surrounding metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's eyes are mechanical with visible cogs and illuminated centers. The eyes are symmetrically positioned, and the glow effect is soft, avoiding any excessive halos or color bleeding that might disrupt the overall image harmony. The cogs integrate well with the surrounding metal, maintaining the consistent texture of the sculpture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden branch beneath the owl well-integrated into the scene, with consistent wood texture, shadowing, and depth relative to the original table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl stands on a wooden branch that appears well-integrated into the scene. The wood texture aligns with natural expectations, and the lighting and shadowing correspond accurately with those of the table surface, ensuring depth and realism. The branch does not appear out of place or separate from its environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the engraved patterns across the body now resemble metallic feathers with consistent layering and directionality, without pixelation or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the engraved patterns on the owl's body resemble metallic feathers with consistent detail and directionality. The transformation retains the intricacy found in similar metallic work, ensuring high-quality detailing without visible pixelation. These elements contribute to a realistic and texturally cohesive appearance, preserving the craftsmanship evident in the original image.",
