    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed building retain consistent geometric proportions and smooth surface transitions, with no visible warping or broken edges in its armored body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building has been transformed into a robotic figure with a symmetrical and geometric design, reminiscent of a robot. The edits ensure that the structure maintains consistent geometric proportions throughout, with smooth surface transitions. The lines and edges are crisp, without any visible warping or discontinuities, indicating a cohesive transformation from a regular building. The visual appearance suggests a deliberate design, maintaining the original geometric integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stylized shoulder pads seamlessly integrated into the roofline, with clean, sharp edges and coherent patterns that do not appear stretched or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation in Image B includes the addition of stylized shoulder pads that are integrated into the roofline of the robotic structure. These shoulder pads exhibit clean and sharp edges, without any signs of stretching or fragmentation. The integration appears smooth, and the patterns on these shoulder pads are coherent, contributing to the overall sleek design of the robot, maintaining the architectural aesthetics.",

      "question": "Do the replaced traffic signs display clear holographic effects (e.g., soft glow, transparency) without causing light leaks or unnatural color shifts in adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the traffic signs have been replaced, but they do not exhibit clear holographic effects such as a soft glow or transparency. They appear as solid structures with no indication of holography impacting nearby colors or lighting. The surrounding areas show no signs of light leaks or unnatural color shifts, suggesting that the edits were restrained, focusing on structural changes rather than visual effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the robotic pedestrians have correctly proportioned limbs with five fingers per hand, and do their joints and body shapes follow geometric logic without unnatural bending or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pedestrians have been transformed into robotic figures. However, these figures do not display fingers, and their body shapes are more stylized rather than anatomically correct. The limbs are simplified and lack detailed proportioning such as distinct joint articulation or segmentation typically seen in humanoid forms. This lacks the geometric logic expected in a realism-oriented transformation.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are shadows cast by the robotic pedestrians and the transformed building consistent with the direction of sunlight from the top-left, and do they align naturally with surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the lighting in Image B, the shadows cast by the robotic pedestrians and the transformed building align with the expected direction from the top-left, consistent with the shadows seen on other objects like the lamp post in the image. This indicates that the editing process considered the direction of sunlight, ensuring shadows align naturally with the environment, maintaining overall realism.",
