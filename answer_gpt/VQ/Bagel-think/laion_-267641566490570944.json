      "question": "Are the crystal horns on the dragon head proportionally sized relative to the mountain peak and do they exhibit natural refraction and transparency consistent with crystalline material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts a dragon with horns on its head that visually appear large, yet are proportionately sized relative to the mountain peak. However, the texture and rendering of the horns do not exhibit the typical characteristics of crystalline materials, such as transparency or refraction. Crystalline horns are expected to have clear, glass-like qualities that interact with light in specific ways. The horns in the image appear opaque, without the natural refraction and transparency associated with crystal materials.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ridge lines forming the dragon body show smooth, flowing transitions without abrupt angular bends or disproportionate thickness changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual structures of the dragon's body show a series of ridges that generally adhere to smooth, flowing transitions. However, upon closer examination, some areas may exhibit abrupt angular bends or thickness changes that are inconsistent with typical biological or smooth flowing structures found in nature. These inconsistencies could detract from the natural appearance of the dragon's body.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rocky scales and moss-covered spines distributed in a way that mimics natural erosion and plant growth patterns without repeating textures or uniform spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon image shows rocky scales and moss-covered spines that are intended to mimic natural patterns. While some areas suggest randomness consistent with natural distribution due to erosion and growth patterns, there are sections where textures appear to repeat and display uniform spacing, which might not accurately mimic true natural occurrences. This suggests the use of repeated patterns rather than a completely organic distribution.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the dragon tail fade into the mist with a soft gradient, maintaining visibility of form through haze without sharp cutoffs or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition of the dragon tail into the mist is carefully calibrated with a soft gradient that allows the viewer to discern the tail's form through the haze. The transition appears natural, lacking any sharp cutoffs or disjointed segments that could disrupt the image. This gives the impression of a believable interaction between the dragon's form and the environmental mist, exhibiting continuity and cohesion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dragon features align with the sun's position in the sky and match the lighting on surrounding mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in the image suggests a light source from the left side where the sun is positioned. The shadows and highlights on the dragon's features are predominantly consistent with this lighting direction, as they match the way light interacts with the surrounding mountainous terrain. The alignment maintains realism in the image by closely adhering to the natural light source depicted in the scene.",
