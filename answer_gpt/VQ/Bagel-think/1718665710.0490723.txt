    "explanation": "In Image B, the black outlines around the character are consistently thick and delineate the boundaries between different elements like hair, skin, and armor. It's typical for illustrations to have bold outlines for clarity and separation of design details.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the armor display consistent glossy reflections and smooth color transitions without pixelation or repeating patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the armor shows flat colors typical of chibi designs, with minimal gradients or reflections. While glossy reflections and smooth transitions are more common in realistic images, chibi representations often prioritize clear outlines over detailed texture transitions.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the shoulder pauldrons and chest plate clearly defined with intact edges and symmetrical design, free from geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shoulder pauldrons and chest plate are clearly defined and symmetrical, characteristic of chibi designs that maintain geometric integrity. The design is stylized, typical of keychains, but free from distortions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the silver chain attached at a coherent point and composed of uniformly shaped links that appear physically connected to the figure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the attachment of the silver chain appears logical for a keychain design with uniform links. The chain is shown connected to a point on the character that makes sense in context, consistent with the purpose of a keychain.",
    "answer": "Yes"
