    "Question": "Q1: Do the feathers exhibit smooth, continuous gradients of fiery coloration without visible banding, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the feathers have been creatively edited to feature fiery coloration. Upon examination, the coloration transitions show abrupt shifts rather than smooth, continuous gradients. There is evidence of digital enhancements, and the sudden color shifts reflect this. Therefore, the coloration does not consist of smooth gradients.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the tail smoothly transform into smoke-like tendrils without abrupt cutoffs or disconnected segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tail has been altered to resemble flames or smoke-like tendrils. These tendrils do not exhibit a smooth transformation and instead show clear digital effects. There is an abruptness in their appearance, which suggests cutoffs or disjointed segments rather than a smooth, natural transformation.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the molten gold accents seamlessly blended into the wing and crest surfaces, showing depth and reflection consistent with metallic material?",
    "explanation": "The edited image displays molten gold accents on the rooster's crest and wings. However, these accents do not reflect the characteristics of real metallic surfaces, such as seamless blending or consistent depth and reflection. The digital nature of the overlays means they stand out rather than integrate smoothly with the natural textures of the rooster.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the flame-like eyes maintain the original eye shape and size, with no distortion of the surrounding facial features?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the eyes have been modified to appear flame-like, deviating from a natural rooster eye. This alteration has affected the shape and potentially the size, and it does impact the surrounding facial features by distorting the natural appearance of the rooster's face.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the rune patterns clearly visible but not oversized or warped, preserving the natural shape and texture of the talons?",
    "explanation": "The edited image incorporates rune patterns, which are prominently visible on the rooster. However, these patterns are oversized relative to the natural features and do not preserve the original shape and texture of the talons, indicating a distortion from their natural state.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the roosterâ€™s body posture and limb alignment preserved, with no stretching, compression, or misplacement of limbs relative to the torso?",
    "explanation": "Despite the extensive edits in Image B, the basic body posture and limb alignment of the rooster appear to be maintained. The limbs do not look stretched or compressed, and they remain in alignment with the torso, suggesting that this aspect of the rooster's physiology has been preserved in the edit.",
    "answer": "Yes"
