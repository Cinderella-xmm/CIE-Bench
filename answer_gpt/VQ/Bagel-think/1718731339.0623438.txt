    "Question": "Q1: Are all fine details such as spikes, rivets, and surface scratches on the armor clearly visible and undistorted after miniaturization?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the reduced size of the figure, the details such as spikes, rivets, and surface scratches on the armor appear distinct and preserved without distortion. This indicates careful attention to detail during miniaturization, which ensures these components remain visible and maintains the integrity of the armor's texture and design. Miniaturization often risks losing fine details, but given the clarity observed, they remain prominent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Does the glass dome enclose the figure without visible seams, distortion, or unnatural refraction effects that alter the appearance of the armor?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the glass dome encasing the figure shows a smooth and seamless appearance with no noticeable distortions or refraction effects that interfere with the visual clarity of the armor. Glass domes can often create optical effects due to curvature, but in this case, the transparency is preserved, ensuring that the armor's appearance remains true and undisturbed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the cogwheels at the base fully connected to the foundation, with interlocking teeth and consistent size ratios, and no floating or disconnected parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cogwheels at the base display a cohesive design, where the teeth interlock properly and exhibit consistent size ratios, indicating a well-structured connection. There are no signs of floating or disconnected parts, suggesting robust integration with the base, which is critical for mechanical authenticity in such designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
} 

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the mechanical wings securely connected to the shoulder armor, matching the metal texture and spike design, and free of unnatural bends or misaligned joints?",
    "explanation": "Examination of Image B shows that the mechanical wings are not connected at the shoulder armor but rather positioned separately in the dome. However, when observing their position and texture, they match the metal texture and spike design found in the armor, though they do not exhibit any misaligned joints or unnatural bends. The positioning maintains consistency with design aesthetics but does not involve physical attachment.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the copper pipes follow continuous paths along armor joints, maintain consistent diameter and smooth bends, and avoid intersecting with key armor components?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, no copper pipes are visibly integrated along the armor joints. As such, their assessment regarding path continuity, diameter consistency, or intersection with armor components is non-applicable as these elements are not present in the image setup.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the brass orbs positioned at varying distances around the figure, not touching or clipping into the armor or dome, and displaying uniform material finish and lighting?",
    "explanation": "Image B reveals brass orbs positioned with varying distances within the glass dome. Upon inspection, these orbs maintain separation from the armor and the dome itself, suggesting no clipping issues. Additionally, they reflect a uniform material finish and consistent lighting, which contributes to their distinct visibility and aesthetic appeal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
