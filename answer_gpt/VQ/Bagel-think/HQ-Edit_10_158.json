      "question": "Are the wood grain patterns across the surface of the boot evenly distributed and consistent with natural wood textures, avoiding artificial or repetitive patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot exhibits wood grain patterns that appear organic and evenly distributed. Woods naturally have varied grain patterns, which are visible as long streaks and lines flowing across the boot. This distribution mimics natural wood textures accurately without repeating artificially, conveying the boot was carved or modeled to resemble natural wood. Through observation and knowledge of wood's natural patterns, the distribution seems non-artificial and evenly formed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the transitions between light and dark wood tones on the boot follow the same contour and depth as the original leather and rubber sections, ensuring no abrupt or unrealistic shifts in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boot in Image B demonstrates smooth transitions in tones and shading that correspond with the form and depth of the boot. The wood tones gradually shift from dark to light, following the contours meticulously, similar to how light and shadows behave on leather and rubber surfaces. No abrupt or unrealistic transitions in the color are visible, indicating the shades were carefully applied to mimic the light interaction with the boot's original depth and contour.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lacing holes and surrounding reinforcement areas shaped precisely like the original metal hardware and fabric loops, without deformation or missing structural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lacing holes appear shaped similar to those found in typical boots, echoing metal hardware and fabric loops without any notable deformation or missing elements. The hardware is intricately represented using dark tones, suggesting metal components. Observations indicate fidelity to the original structures, retaining the integrity of metal and fabric-like characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden shelf flat, stable, and properly aligned beneath the boot, with no visible warping, floating, or unsupported edges that break physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden shelf in Image B is depicted as flat and well-aligned under the boot, featuring clean edges and surface without visible warping or floating sections. The shelf provides stable support consistent with physical laws, ensuring the boot rests correctly without defying gravity or balance principles. Observations confirm the shelfâ€™s structure adheres to realistic and logical physical support.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the boot retain its original three-dimensional shape, including toe box, heel, and ankle support, without any stretching, flattening, or irregular bulges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boot retains its three-dimensional form akin to typical boots, with a clearly defined toe box, heel, and ankle support. The boot exhibits robust structure, indicating proper representation of these sections without signs of stretching, flattening, or bulging irregularities, ensuring it preserves the authentic shape expected of such footwear.",
