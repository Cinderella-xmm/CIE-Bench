      "question": "Does the navy blue mesh pattern on the can maintain consistent texture density and alignment without visible warping or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the navy blue mesh pattern on the shoe exhibits consistent texture density and alignment. The mesh appears uniform without any visible warping or stretching, which indicates that the surface has not been distorted in any way by editing. This consistency in the texture suggests that the mesh pattern is well-preserved and naturally aligned.",

      "question": "Is the brand logo clearly visible on the front of the can, correctly proportioned, and free from blurring or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand logo located near the ankle area of the shoe (often similar to a 'C' in a stylized format for Champion) is sharp and clear, maintaining its original proportions. There is no noticeable blurring or deformation, which suggests that the logo has not been altered or edited improperly. The edges are clean, contributing to a professional appearance.",

      "question": "Are the embossed lace textures evenly spaced and aligned around the can, without jagged edges or inconsistent depth that suggests digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laces of the shoe appear to be evenly spaced and aligned. The texture suggests a natural depth without any noticeable artifacting such as jagged edges or uneven placement, which would suggest digital manipulation. The entire lace configuration gives a cohesive appearance, indicative of precise editing or retention of the original design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sole stripes wrap seamlessly around the lower half of the can, maintaining their shape and spacing without tearing or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes on the sole of the shoe have been replaced by red text. These alterations maintain a seamless wrap around the shoe's lower half. On closer examination, the text appears to follow the contours of the sole without tearing or misalignment and maintains consistent spacing around the shoe, although the overlap with original detailing would create a different visual effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the red \"Kickstart\" text clearly readable, properly centered on the white area, and free from shadowing or blurring that would suggest poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red text on what appears to be the sole has been replaced with the word 'Akissimi'. It is not clearly readable due to its fitment being too large and spaced awkwardly across the area, and it does appear to overlap and misfit the available white space. The text suffers from some degrees of shadowing and potential blurring, suggesting possible poor rendering or misalignment in the edit.",
