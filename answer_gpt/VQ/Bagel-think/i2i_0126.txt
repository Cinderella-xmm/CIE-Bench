    "Question": "Q1: Are the proportions of both characters consistent and free from distortion in their respective views within the combined illustration?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the characters appear consistent across the different panels. Each character maintains a similar body size and posture when compared to the others, showing no visible signs of distortion or inconsistency despite appearing in different contexts within the scene. This suggests that their portrayal is consistent and aligns well with the overall illustration style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the textures of the office elements such as chairs, plants, and desks appear natural and retain fine details without obvious artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the office elements like chairs, plants, and desks are designed in a simplified and stylized manner, which is consistent with an illustrative or cartoon-like aesthetic. This style does not emphasize fine details but rather focuses on clear outlines and shapes. As a result, there are no obvious artifacts and the simplified textures align with the overall style, giving a cohesive appearance to the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the computer screens realistic with sharp images, and does the interaction between the characters and screens appear natural without visible artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the computer screens are depicted with simple solid colors, representative of an illustration rather than photographic realism. The interaction between the characters and the screens is coherent with this illustrative style, without visible errors or artifacts, as both characters are positioned naturally interacting with their respective computer equipment. This results in a cohesive and artifact-free representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the characters align correctly with their environment, maintaining a plausible spatial relationship and avoiding any broken geometric shapes or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are well-integrated into their environment, showing consistent alignment with office elements like desks and chairs. The perspective and composition maintain a coherent spatial relationship, ensuring that geometric shapes such as tables and chairs remain intact and well-proportioned. This indicates that there are no misalignments or broken shapes to disrupt the spatial consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the lighting, including the hanging lampâ€™s shadow and the light on the characters, maintain consistency and contribute to the natural appearance of the scene without unnatural contrasts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is stylistically simple and consistent, matching the cartoon-like character of the illustration. The shadows, such as the one cast by the hanging lamp, are consistently applied, and the overall lighting setup does not exhibit unnatural contrasts. The shadows are coherent with the positions of objects and light sources, promoting a sense of harmony and natural lighting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
