      "question": "Do the chibi sheep maintain their original interaction pose by the railing in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi sheep are interacting with the fence, similar to the original sheep in Image A. The cartoon version maintains the positioning of the sheep facing the fence, suggesting the interactions are preserved. The reasoning here involves recognizing the similar spatial arrangement between Image A and Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the winter accessories (scarves, earmuffs, gloves) added to the chibi sheep free from unnatural textures and retain fine details similar to the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the winter accessories appear to be well integrated into the cartoonish style of the chibi sheep. The textures are consistent throughout the image, and the details in accessories like scarves and earmuffs are as finely drawn as the chibi sheep themselves, which is common in artwork that aims for a cohesive aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions and poses of the chibi sheep appear physically plausible and coherent with the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that while the chibi style exaggerates certain features for a cute and stylized effect, the proportions and poses still appear coherent with the cartoon scene. The sheep-shaped characters are anthropomorphized to fit into a matching scale for this type of stylized illustration, making the composition appear physically plausible within its artistic context.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the flat, cartoonish style conversion of the sheep maintain a sense of realism without introducing obvious unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the conversion to a flat, cartoon style adapts the elements of the scene into a cohesive, stylized form. Although inherently less realistic due to the artistic style, it avoids unnatural artifacts by providing a consistent illustrative approach across the sheep and accessories, which is crucial for maintaining scene harmony in chibi art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the edited image, including the chibi sheep and their accessories, preserve visual credibility and structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition of Image B, including the chibi sheep and their accessories, creates a visually credible and consistent layout. The positioning of the sheep and the fence, coupled with their well-integrated accessories, ensures structural consistency within the scene, maintaining harmonious artistic design that aligns with the conventions of such illustration style.",
