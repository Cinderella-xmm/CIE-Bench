    "Question": "Q1: Do the chibi-style characters maintain natural proportions and avoid unnatural distortion in their body shapes?",
    "explanation": "Chibi-style characters are characterized by their playful proportions, typically with oversized heads and petite bodies, creating a cute and stylized appearance. In Image B, the characters conform to this chibi aesthetic with their characteristically large heads and proportionally smaller bodies. This stylization is deliberate and a defining trait of chibi art, and resultant proportions are considered natural within this style. Thus, they do not display any unnatural distortion beyond what is expected for chibi characters.",
