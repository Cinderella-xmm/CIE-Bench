    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the isometric packaging box have consistent edges, proper depth cues, and accurate alignment with the toy figures without visible warping or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a packaging box containing car and robot figures. The edges of the box appear straight and well-aligned, alongside accurate depth representation. The internal toy figures line up with the box's dimensions, suggesting they fit well without misalignment or warping. This is based on typical packaging design that ensures products fit neatly inside boxes.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the chibi-style figures inside the box proportionally consistent with typical chibi design rules (e.g., large heads, short limbs) and do they retain identifiable features of the original car and robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toy figures adhere to chibi style with exaggerated features like larger heads and smaller limbs. While the chibi feature is most prominent in the additional driver figure, the main products (car and robot) retain elements such as details and proportions of vehicles despite not being perfectly chibi. However, the robot follows the known concept of a transforming toy, blending mechanical structure and identifiable features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the mini tool set, interchangeable helmets, and gear base clearly defined, properly scaled, and positioned without floating or clipping through other elements inside the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, items such as mini tools and additional helmet appear properly scaled relative to the toy figures. Their positioning seems consistent within the box environment, without floating off surfaces or clipping through adjacent elements. This reflects typical toy accessory arrangement where pieces fit logically in their designated spaces.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the external surfaces of the car and robot exhibit consistent metallic textures with natural highlights and reflections, without visible artifacts like blotches or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays car and robot with metallic textures, showcasing highlights and reflections expected on polished surfaces. No stray artifacts or jagged edges appear visible, suggesting a clean, consistent texture application expected of quality toy models in advertising or packaging.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the reflections and lighting on the showcase surface consistent with the direction of light and the materials of the figures, without unnatural glare or shadow mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B seems uniform, illuminating the box and elements inside with consistent reflection and shadow patterns. The light direction aligns well with the depiction of metallic textures and plastic materials, avoiding erratic glare or shadow placement typical of well-conceived compositions.",
