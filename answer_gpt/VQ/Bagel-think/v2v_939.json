      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D character maintain structural consistency and visual credibility, avoiding unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the analysis of the chibi-style 3D character involves observing its proportions, details, and overall structural consistency. Chibi characters are typically depicted with exaggerated features such as larger heads and smaller bodies. Observing Image B, the character retains these proportions successfully without any distortion or visible artifacts that would detract from its credibility. This conforms to the common design practices for such chibi representations.",

      "question": "Are the playful raindrops surrounding the chibi character visually credible and integrated naturally into the scene without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows raindrops around the character, which are consistent in shape and appearance with typical raindrops, fitting naturally into the environment of rainfall suggested by the image. There are no visible artifacts affecting their integration into the scene, thereby maintaining a coherent look that does not compromise the visual integrity.",

      "question": "Is the oversized, brightly colored umbrella visually consistent with the chibi character and the environment, without causing any unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The umbrella in Image B maintains consistency with the chibi character's style, exhibiting vibrant colors and a simplistic form that matches the character’s playful aesthetic. Upon inspection, it does not show any distortions or abnormal textures that would disrupt its visual harmony with the scene. Such bright and stylized umbrellas are commonly used to enhance the appeal of scenes involving chibi characters.",

      "question": "Do the wall and drainpipe maintain their realistic appearance and function, with the water flow interacting naturally with the ground, without any visible artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall and drainpipe appear consistent with real-world objects. The water flow from the drainpipe interacts naturally with the ground, conforming to visual expectations of how water behaves when flowing from pipes. This interaction suggests the realistic portrayal of these elements without visible artifacts, maintaining the credibility of the scene’s environmental details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the green jacket and boots of the chibi character retain their natural textures and fine details, avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the green jacket and boots of the chibi character are styled to fit the chibi aesthetic, but they retain enough detail to avoid appearing overly simplified or lacking texture. There are no visible unnatural artifacts or loss of detail that would detract from their visual appearance, ensuring their textural consistency within the scene.",
