      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) proportionally accurate and anatomically consistent with the original child's face, without any unnatural stretching or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Ignoring the blurred face as instructed, the focus is on proportional and anatomical consistency from an objective standpoint. In the edited image, the facial features (excluding blur) generally harmonize with typical human proportions; however, without clear visibility of the features due to blur, precise judgment on stretching or warping is not possible. Hence, without such information, consistency cannot be accurately assessed.",
