    "Question": "Q1: Are the limbs of the man and the components of the scooter proportionally coherent and free from geometric distortion such as elongated arms, bent knees, or misaligned wheels?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized, cartoon-like illustration where proportions are deliberately exaggerated. The limbs of the man are simplified and feature rounded forms, typical of cartoon art. The scooter is also depicted in a stylized manner with simpler shapes and curves, lacking the detailed complexity found in realistic depictions. As such, while the proportions may not adhere to realistic physics, they are coherent within the cartoon art style without obvious distortions like elongated arms or misaligned wheels.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the sepia tones cover all areas evenly without visible color banding, blotchy patches, or loss of detail in textures like fabric, stone, or foliage?",
    "explanation": "Image B has an antique, parchment-style background with sepia tones that contribute to an aged look. The tones are applied uniformly across the image, maintaining consistent coloration. Due to the cartoon nature, detailed textures like fabric and foliage are abstracted, eliminating worries about detail loss or blotchy patches in these areas. The uniformity of the sepia tones is consistent with the artwork's style and intention.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the edges of the image softly degraded with a smooth transition into white, without abrupt lines or visible masking artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a parchment-like background but the transition towards white at the edges isn't present, suggesting no intention of softened edge degradation typically seen in vignette or dissolving effects. The design confines within the art-nouveau frame, where the goal is a self-contained illustration without edge fading.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the art-nouveau frame surround the image without overlapping or cutting through the man’s face, scooter, or any background structures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, an art-nouveau style frame is present around the illustration. This frame encases the entire scene neatly and does not intrude upon or overlap the main elements like the man's body or scooter, maintaining clear boundaries between the image content and the decorative border.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the blank writing area located directly beneath the image, aligned horizontally, and free from warping or interference with the scooter’s base or ground line?",
    "explanation": "Image B indeed contains a blank area for writing beneath the illustration. This area is horizontally aligned and distinct from the main illustrated portion. It does not interfere with the base of the scooter or any other elements of the drawing, clearly delineated below the main image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the parchment texture appear uniformly across the image without causing blurring, ghosting, or obscuration of fine details like the man’s beard or window shutters?",
    "explanation": "Image B's cartoon-style illustration has a parchment texture that complements its antique appearance. As the drawing employs simple and bold lines with flat colors, rather than detailed textures, the uniform parchment texture does not blur or obscure details. Its simplicity ensures that elements like clothing and vehicle details remain sharp and unobscured.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the postcards arranged in a stack with realistic shadows, overlapping edges, and twine wrapped around them in a way that suggests physical binding?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict or relate to postcards, stacks, or the concept of physical binding. The image features a single character on a scooter within an art-nouveau frame, and thus the premise of postcards is irrelevant to the analysis of this illustration.",
    "answer": "No"
