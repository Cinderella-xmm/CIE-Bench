    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the silver and turquoise geometric patterns evenly distributed across the handbag's surface without visible misalignment, stretching, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silver and turquoise geometric patterns cover the handbag uniformly. The patterns appear intact, maintaining consistent shapes and sizes throughout the surface. This observation suggests skilled digital editing where the design flows seamlessly without signs of stretching or pixelation that could disrupt the visual harmony. In Image A, the original design also showcases a pattern distribution characteristic of high-quality craftsmanship. Comparing both, the edited version in Image B preserves the aesthetic fidelity and aligns perfectly with the contours, ensuring neat distribution.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic accents on the leather straps appear seamlessly integrated, with no sharp edges, inconsistent shading, or floating highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic accents on the leather straps display smooth integration, with no noticeable sharp edges or inconsistent shading. The highlights align realistically with the contours of the straps and follow the natural flow of light interaction, avoiding an unrealistic floating appearance. In Image A, traditional materials are used, focusing on functionality and aesthetics through consistent stitching and shading, thus corroborating the integration of elements seen in Image B as managed effectively.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the machine-age engravings along the edges of the handbag continuous, properly aligned with the contours, and free from broken lines or overlapping patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features machine-age engravings along the handbag's edges that run continuously and align with its contours. The engravings are precise and free from broken lines or overlapping patterns, indicating adept editing that respects the handbag's structural design. In Image A, such engravings are absent, presenting smooth and uninterrupted surfaces. This comparison emphasizes the addition's compatibility in Image B, enhancing its aesthetic while maintaining alignment consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the front pockets and zippered closure still clearly defined and structurally coherent, with no distortion in their shape or placement relative to each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains clearly defined front pockets and a zippered closure, with their structure remaining unchanged and coherent relative to each other. The editing process ensured that the original placement and proportions were retained, facilitating functional perception. In Image A, these features are prominently and properly structured, providing a reference for assessing clarity and coherence in Image B. Both images depict these elements with similar integrity, supporting their functional design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the transformed surfaces exhibit realistic material properties, such as subtle texture variation and appropriate light reflection, without appearing flat or digitally over-rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases transformed surfaces with realistic material properties, including subtle texture variations and light reflection that lend depth and dimensionality to the design. The surface technology avoids a flat or overly digital appearance, suggesting refinement within the editing process. Comparing this with Image A, where the traditional material naturally exhibits texture and light interaction, Image B achieves a similar realism, showing advanced digital rendering techniques.",
