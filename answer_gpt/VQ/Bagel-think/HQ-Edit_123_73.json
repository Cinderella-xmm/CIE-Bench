    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the pyramidâ€™s steps transformed into armored segments with consistent thickness, alignment, and geometric integrity, without visible breaks or unnatural warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pyramid's steps appear to have a wavy texture that resembles some kind of organic or alien structure rather than straight, consistent stone steps. This implies a transformation away from geometric stone steps towards something more unnatural and inconsistent in its form. The visual cues suggest that they lack geometric integrity. Therefore, the steps are not transformed into armored segments with consistent thickness and alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the entrance at the top of the pyramid replaced with an eye-like structure that matches the stone material and scale, without abrupt texture changes or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top part of the pyramid has a glowing eye-like structure, which looks distinct from the stone material of the pyramid. It does not match the surrounding cement-like textures and seems to be a glowing element placed on top, which represents an abrupt change in texture and appearance.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trees and foliage surrounding the pyramid transform into vine-like scales that follow natural growth patterns and maintain consistent texture and lighting, without unnatural sharp edges or disconnected patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees and foliage appear lit with a blue glow and don't transform into anything resembling vine-like scales. The lighting is inconsistent with natural illumination, creating a more fantastical look that doesn't adhere to natural growth patterns, showing sharp edges and disconnected visual elements across the pyramid.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are ancient stone patterns preserved and integrated into the base of the pyramid-creature, maintaining continuity with original carvings and avoiding mismatched or floating decorative elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original stone patterns are not clearly visible, and there seems to be no continuity with the original pyramid's carvings. Instead, there is an added visual effect of glowing patterns and highlights, which do not attempt to mimic or preserve ancient stone patterns. This results in a lack of integration with the original base.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the luminescent plants around the base emit soft, localized light that interacts realistically with the environment, without overexposed areas or unnatural color spillage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminescent glow emitted from light-blue elements surrounding the pyramid does not interact with the environment in a realistic manner. The light appears overly intense and dispersed, leading to an overexposed effect and unnatural blue color spillage over the forest, which does not imitate natural lighting scenarios.",
