    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the glass display case surrounding the car and road clearly defined with smooth edges, proper transparency, and no floating or misaligned sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a glass display case encasing a miniature environment. It is visibly constructed with neat edges and corners, displaying consistent transparency without any distortion or alignment issues. This smoothness and transparency suggest the case has been meticulously modeled.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the carâ€™s surface exhibit consistent metallic red coloring with smooth gradient transitions and preserved sharp detail lines along the body panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car within the display case shows a metallic red surface. The color transitions smoothly without abrupt changes and the details of the panel lines are clear and sharp, indicating well-rendered textures consistent with high-quality modeling.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the resin layers in the road and cliff areas visibly distinct with gradual transparency and depth cues, avoiding flat or uniformly colored sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road and cliff are constructed within the display case. These elements demonstrate gradual transparency and depth cues, such as layering and color variation, avoiding any flat or overly uniform appearance and suggesting a realistic portrayal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the micro gravel texture evenly distributed across the road and cliff surfaces, with natural variation in size and no repetitive or artificial patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a base texture resembling gravel. It appears evenly distributed and shows natural variation in grain size, avoiding any repetitive or artificial patterns that would detract from the realism of the miniature environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sunset sky panel blend smoothly with the original sky, maintaining consistent color gradients and horizon alignment without visible seams or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunset sky depicted blends seamlessly with the rest of the scene, showing smooth color gradients and consistent horizon alignment. There are no visible seams or clipping issues, indicating an accurate integration of elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the car, road, cliffs, and display case consistent with a miniature scale, avoiding exaggerated or unrealistic sizing relationships?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a miniature display case where the car, road, and cliff elements are scaled appropriately within the confined space. The relationships among these objects do not display any exaggeration or distortion, aligning with expectations of a miniature scale.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
