    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the shadows under and around the protruding clock consistent with its new 3D effect without creating artificial or inconsistent lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows are cast underneath and slightly to the side of the clock, indicating a light source from the upper left. This creates a believable 3D effect, as the shading aligns with how light typically interacts with objects that protrude from a surface. The consistency of the shadows suggests a natural integration into the scene without artificial effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the circular shape of the clock remain undistorted and geometrically sound after being altered to appear as if it protrudes from the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock maintains a perfect circular shape, which is crucial for a clock's design. The 3D effect gives it depth, but the circular geometry remains undistorted, reflecting an accurate transformation process.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the textures and fine details on the clock face been preserved, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or pixelation as a result of making it appear 3D?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock face in Image B shows smooth and clean textures without visible signs of pixelation or distortion. The details, such as the clock hands and face surface, appear sharp and consistent with high-quality imagery. This indicates careful preservation of the image quality during the 3D rendering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the clock's hands and markings retain their original clarity, style, and proportion, contributing to a natural and credible appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock's hands are sharp, well-defined, and proportionately placed, consistent with the original style. Their clarity and design stay intact, contributing to the realistic depiction of a functioning clock.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited clock appear to naturally integrate into the wall with a realistic thickness and depth, maintaining visual plausibility within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock in Image B appears to have a realistic edge thickness and depth, suggesting it is a tangible object protruding from the wall. The shadows and lighting complement this effect, making it look naturally integrated and plausible within the scene.",
