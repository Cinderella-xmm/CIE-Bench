    "Question": "Q1: Do the man's limbs and torso maintain proportional relationships and natural joint articulation despite stylization?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man is represented in a stylized or chibi format, which often alters proportions for artistic effect. Despite this, the limb and torso proportions appear balanced, with natural joint articulation typical of stylized portrayals. By comparison, Image A shows a realistic human form, confirming that Image B maintains proportional integrity in its stylization.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the textures of the tuxedo and fur jacket rendered with sufficient detail and depth to appear physically plausible despite stylization?",
    "explanation": "Image B's stylized representation uses simplified textures. While the tuxedo and fur jacket lack intricate detail, they provide enough texture and depth to suggest physical plausibility within the context of stylization. In Image A, the textures are realistic, bolstering the plausibility of Image B's simplified rendition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the FIA logo and sponsor names clearly visible and correctly formed within the simplified linear background design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the FIA logo and sponsor names are stylized yet clear, maintaining legibility within the simplified design. They are correctly formed, similar to Image A's realistic depiction, ensuring visibility against the background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the gold ribbon-like border fully closed, evenly shaped, and consistently thick around the entire perimeter of the stamp?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a gold ribbon-like border that is evenly shaped and consistently thick around its perimeter, giving a closed and cohesive appearance. This stylized design element effectively encloses the depicted individuals, as intended.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the embossed logo on the blue envelope show consistent depth, soft shadows, and surface texture without appearing flat or artificially rendered?",
    "explanation": "The embossed logo in Image B has soft shadows and surface texture, suggesting consistent depth. It avoids looking flat, offering an appearance of dimensionality despite the stylized nature. This is indicative of careful rendering, similar to effects seen in realistic depictions like Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the stamp positioned with appropriate shadowing and perspective to appear physically attached to the envelope surface?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases the stamp with shadowing and perspective that suggest it is physically attached to the envelope surface. The representation gives a realistic appearance of attachment, reflecting good design practices similar to how positioning is demonstrated in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do both individuals have exactly five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no deformation or missing digits?",
    "explanation": "Despite the stylized design in Image B, both individuals feature five fingers on each hand. The hand shapes are rendered naturally, avoiding any deformation or missing digits, consistent with the proportions observed in the more realistic Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
