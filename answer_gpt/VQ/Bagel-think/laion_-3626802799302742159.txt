    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) and limbs added to the cookies smooth, proportionally consistent with the cookie size, and free from pixelation or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies have added facial features like eyes and mouths, which are designed to fit naturally within the cookie size. Upon examining these features, they appear well-proportioned to each cookie's surface area, and there are no signs of pixelation or jagged edges. The edges are smooth, indicating a clean digital enhancement that complements the overall design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the floral pattern on the transformed plate appear continuous, evenly distributed, and consistent with fabric texture, without visible seams or unnatural stretching?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the plate is decorated with a floral pattern. Each flower looks evenly distributed across the surface. There are no evident seams or stretches in the pattern, suggesting a natural and uniform placement. This gives the illusion of a printed design consistent with fabric-like patterns.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the added miniature chairs and tea table positioned within the cup and around it in a way that respects physical proportions and does not cause overlapping or floating elements?",
    "explanation": "The added elements in Image B, such as the miniature chairs, are placed around the cup and cookies. These objects are scaled properly to match the size of the cookies and cup, respecting real-world proportions. No portions appear to be floating or incorrectly overlapping, indicating thoughtful placement with attention to realistic depth.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the facial expressions on the cookies (grinning, pouting, winking) show clear differentiation in mouth and eye shapes while maintaining symmetry and natural curvature?",
    "explanation": "The various facial expressions on the cookies in Image B are distinct, with different shapes for mouths and eyes signifying expressions such as grinning, pouting, and winking. The designs maintain symmetry suitable for each expression and exhibit natural curves without irregularities, allowing for easy identification of the mood each cookie is portraying.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the positions of the cookie characters, chairs, and tea table arranged in a way that suggests stable contact with surfaces and realistic depth, without floating or misplaced objects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the cookies, chairs, and other objects demonstrates a well-considered setup. Each element appears to touch the surfaces they are meant to be on, and there's an appropriate depth perception that avoids the illusion of floating. Everything is placed in a manner that reflects realistic physical contact with the surfaces, suggesting a stable and ordered presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
