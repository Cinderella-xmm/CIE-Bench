      "question": "Does the gear surface on the tabletop show consistent metallic sheen and detailed engravings without blurred or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tabletop in Image B features a richly detailed and intricate design, indicative of a steampunk style. The engravings are visible with clarity, showing a consistent and smooth metallic sheen that is common in polished metal surfaces, and there are no visual cues to suggest blurring or jagged edges. This precise craftsmanship reflects a high-quality finish typically respected in metalworking.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the piston-driven limbs symmetrically arranged and proportionally scaled to the central column, with clearly defined joints and no bent or broken segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central column in Image B is adorned with symmetrical mechanical components, akin to pistons, that are consistently arranged around the column. The joints appear well-defined, without any indication of bending or breakage. This symmetry is crucial in steampunk designs, where mechanical aesthetics are emphasized.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the steam vents evenly spaced along the central column and properly embedded into the metal surface without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection, the steam vents integrated into the central column in Image B are evenly spaced, contributing to a visually balanced appearance. They seem to be firmly attached to the surface, without any noticeable detachment or misalignment, which is consistent with a quality craftsmanship often associated with mechanical designs.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cog patterns and dials on the base have intact geometric shapes with uniform spacing and no overlapping or incomplete features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cog patterns and dials on the base in Image B are distinctly visible, with intact geometric shapes that showcase uniform spacing. There appears to be no overlap or incomplete features, which indicates meticulous design and execution, aligning with the intricate and precise nature of steampunk and mechanical aesthetics.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brass and copper accents clearly differentiated from the silver metal by color and reflectivity, without unnatural gradients or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass and copper accents are distinguishable from the silver metal through their distinctive color and reflectivity. The differentiation is clear and adds to the overall aesthetic harmony of the design. There are no noticeable unnatural gradients or texture artifacts, which ensures a sleek and polished look.",
