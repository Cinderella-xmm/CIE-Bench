    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the surface of the model’s dress retain the same pebbled leather texture as the original handbag, with no visible smoothing, blurring, or texture repetition artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model's dress appears to be made of a smooth fabric rather than the pebbled leather finish of the handbag. Pebbled leather has a distinctive texture that is not visible on the dress, which appears uniform and lacking in any leather-like texture. Therefore, the surface of the dress does not retain the handbag's texture.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the shape of the dress consistent with the original handbag’s contours, especially around the base and shoulder area, without unnatural bulges, pinching, or loss of dimensionality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress worn by the model is fitted and streamlined, typical of a fashion ensemble, compared to the rounded and three-dimensional form of a handbag. There are no unnatural bulges or pinching noted; however, the shape is inherently different due to its purpose as clothing versus a handbag's design.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the gold accessories positioned naturally on the model’s body, with proper alignment and scale relative to the face and limbs, and do they appear anchored without floating or clipping through skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold accessories, specifically the necklace, are placed around the neck of the model and appear appropriately scaled and well-aligned. They do not seem to be floating or clipping, suggesting natural positioning.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the MK logo charm clearly visible on the dress, maintaining its original circular shape and gold finish, without warping, stretching, or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The MK logo charm is not visible on the dress. The handbag's logo is not incorporated into the dress design, as the dress design instead features 'MICHAEL KORS' text and does not include the circular charm.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the background elements (runway, photographers, lights) align with the model’s position in terms of perspective, shadow direction, and depth of field, without overlapping or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background elements, including the runway and photographers, align with the model in a cohesive manner. The perspective and depth of field appear consistent and the lighting seems uniform across the scene, suggesting a coherent setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the entire model, text, and background contained within the vertical frame without any cut-off limbs, text, or objects, and is the layout vertically balanced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model, text, and background are fully within the vertical frame. There are no visible cut-offs for limbs or text, and the layout appears balanced, with the model centered and text placed at the bottom.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the text “Strut the City Streets” displayed in a clear serif font at the top of the image, without blurring, aliasing, or overlap with the model or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in the image reads 'Stroiaia Mooh' in a stylized script-like font at the bottom of the image, rather than 'Strut the City Streets' in a serif font. Hence, the specific text and font do not appear as specified.",
