      "question": "Does the transition from the realistic depiction of the patient to the pop-art comic design appear smooth without introducing unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition to a pop-art comic style introduces bold colors and outlines, characteristics typical of pop-art. The textures appear deliberate to match the genre, implementing halftone patterns and graphic design elements seen commonly in comic art. These changes are coherent and don't seem to introduce random artifacts; thus the transition appears smooth within the pop art framework.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the halftone patterns and bold graphical details added to the image consistent with the rest of the scene and do not look out of place or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Halftone patterns and bold graphical details are defining characteristics of pop-art and comic styles. In Image B, these patterns are applied uniformly across the scene on both the patient and nurse, as well as the background elements like the medical equipment. This consistency in style does not create distortion and all elements blend together well within the pop-art theme.",

      "question": "Do the core elements like the IV stand, monitors, and nurse retain their structural integrity and remain visually credible within the pop-art comic design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the transformation into a pop-art comic design, key elements such as the IV stand, monitors, and nurse retain their recognizable shapes and integrity. The conversion to comic style focuses primarily on color and outline changes while maintaining the structural integrity needed to keep them identifiable and credible within this artistic theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the shapes of objects such as the bed, pillows, and medical equipment been preserved without distortion or damage in the pop-art comic design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the transition to a comic art style in Image B, the shape and form of objects like the bed, pillows, and medical equipment are preserved accurately. The pop-art style employs bright colors and defined outlines without significantly altering the contours or introducing distortion, maintaining their recognizable forms.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the patient's facial features and the nurse's uniform preserved without loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts in the pop-art comic design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the pop-art style naturally simplifies and stylizes details into graphic forms, Image B adapts these features into the genre without losing structural basics. The patient's facial features are altered to fit the stylistic approach, yet remain distinct and compatible with the pop-art aesthetic; similarly, the nurse's uniform transitions into graphic detailing that aligns with comic design principles without artifact introduction.",
