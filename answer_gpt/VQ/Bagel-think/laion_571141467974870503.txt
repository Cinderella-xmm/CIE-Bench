    "Question": "Q1: Are the bold primary colors applied to the train's body consistent across all surfaces without visible color bleeding or mismatched tones?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the train with a design utilizing bold primary colors that are consistent and applied evenly across its surfaces. The colors are bright and distinct without any visible color bleeding or mismatched tones between them, as these colors are well-defined and uniform, showing clear separation. This is typical of graphic stylization in digital art where colors are applied with precision.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the halftone dot patterns on the train display consistent size, spacing, and alignment across all visible panels without distortion or clustering?",
    "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the train features bold colors but does not include halftone dot patterns as described in the question. The design relies on solid color application rather than texture patterns like halftone dots, which are usually characterized by a clear, consistent size and spacing when present in stylized graphics.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the geometric shapes used to replace the barn’s wood texture aligned with the original architectural elements such as windows, doors, and roofline without breaking their structural boundaries?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the barn’s texture is replaced with solid color and basic shapes that do not disrupt the integrity of structural elements such as the windows, doors, and roofline. The geometric shapes are applied uniformly, aligning well with these architectural features, maintaining the building's form without crossing or breaking boundaries.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the graphic bursts representing foliage positioned in a way that respects the original spatial layout, with no overlapping or misplaced elements that contradict the scene’s depth?",
    "explanation": "The graphic bursts in Image B are used to replace foliage and are positioned thoughtfully to respect the original spatial layout from Image A. There are vibrant, colorful bursts that maintain depth and do not overlap or misposition relative to the landscape, ensuring coherence with the scene's depth and overall composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the black outlines around the train, barn, and foliage uniformly sharp, continuous, and free from gaps or misalignments at object edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines around the train, barn, and foliage are distinctly sharp and continuous, adhering to a consistent thickness and style typical of a graphic art approach. These outlines effectively constrain each element without gaps or misalignments, providing a clean and well-defined edge to all illustrated objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
