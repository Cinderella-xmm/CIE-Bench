      "question": "Does the exaggerated and elongated clock tower retain its structural consistency and does it appear logically consistent with the original proportions of the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower is depicted in a chibi, stylized form, which means it's exaggeratedly tall and narrow compared to its realistic proportions. The transformation prioritizes a cartoon-like visual style, which may distort original proportions for aesthetic purposes. Comparing it to Image A, where the tower's proportions are more grounded and accurate, Image B's tower does not retain the logical consistency or original proportions of a real-world clock tower.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colorful geometric flowerbed rings natural in appearance, lacking any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows colorful geometric rings at the base of the clock tower, presented in bright, flat colors typical of a chibi art style. These rings do not aim to replicate the details or textures found in real-life objects like flowers as seen in Image A. Instead, they prioritize simplicity and bold color. Thus, they lack natural appearance and detailed texture present in real flowerbeds.",

      "question": "Does the transition from the chibi-style illustration elements to the glossy enamel coloring look smooth and free of visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B embodies a chibi-style illustration combined with bold color choices that mimic the appearance of glossy enamel. This artistic choice typically reflects a smooth and polished style, a hallmark of many enamel artworks. Given this style often emphasizes uniformity and sheen without artifacts, the transition appears smooth and intentional, adhering to aesthetic standards of such illustrative and enamel combinations.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the clock tower and flowerbed badge maintain a vertical, metallic structure consistent with a city souvenir badge, without any structural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style depiction of the clock tower and flowerbed adopts a bold, illustrative design that is flat rather than metallic, and focuses more on color simplicity and exaggeration. While it has artistic integrity, it does not strictly adhere to representing a vertical, metallic structure akin to a conventional city souvenir badge. The stylized art causes deliberate distortions from realistic shapes and textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style transformation of the clock tower and flowerbed retain a natural and authentic appearance, avoiding any obvious distortions or unrealistic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B applies a chibi-style which generally involves stylized, exaggerated proportions and elements that deviate from natural realism. This transformation intentionally incorporates unrealistic features as part of its artistic nature. Hence, the appearance is not meant to be naturally authentic, and does feature distortions typical of chibi illustrations when compared to the realistic depiction in Image A.",
