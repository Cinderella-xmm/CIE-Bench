    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed hairstyle retain a consistent volumetric structure without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in the cotton candy swirls?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hairstyle resembles swirls of cotton candy, which are smooth, rounded, and continuous. The volumetric structure appears consistent as the swirls flow naturally without any abrupt or jagged interruptions, suggesting a well-constructed design. This aligns with the common visual expectation of a cotton candy-like hairstyle, which should be cohesive and soft. Therefore, based on the visual cues and typical characteristics of such designs, the hairstyle in Image B maintains a consistent structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the suit’s surface uniformly glossy without areas of over-saturation or unnatural reflection that disrupt the 3D paper doll illusion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the suit displays a smooth, glossy texture with a balanced distribution of light reflections, which maintains a paper doll illusion. The colors are vibrant and consistent, with no visible areas of over-saturation or harsh reflections that might break the visual coherence or give an unnatural appearance. The uniform glossiness contributes to the cartoon-like, stylized aesthetic expected in such a design, enhancing the illusion without disrupting it.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the oversized tie proportionally aligned with the collar and neck area without distorting the jawline or shirt collar?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tie is notably oversized but appears properly aligned with the collar and neck area, maintaining aesthetic proportionality. The tie does not intrude upon or distort the visual integrity of the surrounding regions, such as the jawline or shirt collar area, which remain undistorted and continuously flowing. This careful alignment ensures that the cartoon style is preserved without any awkward overlaps or disproportionate elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the pastel pink and blue hues smoothly blended throughout the hair without visible color banding or hard edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pastel hues covering the hair are uniformly blended, resulting in a seamless transition of colors. There are no visible boundaries or harsh lines interrupting the color distribution, which would otherwise indicate poor blending or banding. The smooth color flow is indicative of a polished digital illustration, maintaining the visual appeal expected from a stylized graphic representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the geometric patterns on the suit align with the garment’s seams and contours without overlapping or breaking at critical structural points?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric patterns on the suit are seemingly aligned with the shape and contours of the garment, adapting to its flow without breaking at critical junctures. This alignment preserves the structural integrity of the suit's design, ensuring that patterns do not interfere or misalign with the imagined 3D structure of the piece. Such alignment is essential in maintaining a coherent visual style, characteristic of structured yet dynamic patterns fitting digital illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
