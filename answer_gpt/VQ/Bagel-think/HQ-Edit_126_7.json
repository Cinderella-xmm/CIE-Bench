    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cat’s body exhibit a smooth, flowing mist-like texture with a consistent sky-blue hue that blends naturally without sharp edges or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the cat is transformed into a cloud-like texture with a flowing and soft appearance. The hue is consistent with sky-blue shades that blend smoothly, giving the image a cohesive feel. The transitions between colors and textures are well-rendered without abrupt edges or artifacts, indicating smooth digital editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the swirling cumulus cluster positioned atop the cat’s head in a way that follows natural cloud formation and integrates seamlessly with the head’s shape without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cumulus cloud formation atop the cat's head follows a natural pattern and integrates smoothly with the shape of the head. The cloud appears aligned and part of the composition rather than floating separately, which suggests a thoughtful and careful positioning reflecting natural aesthetics.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cloud patterns integrated into the cat’s body in a way that respects the original fur direction and does not cause visible distortion or unnatural layering over the striped pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows cloud patterns merging into the cat's body, concealing the original fur pattern entirely while establishing a new texture. Although the stripes are not visible, the integration does not distort the existing contour or shape of the cat’s body, maintaining a natural, smooth look indicative of cloud assimilation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the translucent wings have a soft, ethereal appearance with subtle cloud swirls and are they attached to the cat’s body in a way that preserves anatomical plausibility and spatial consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the translucent wings exhibit a soft and ethereal appearance with cloud swirls, enhancing the fantastical theme. Their attachment to the cat's body preserves spatial consistency with the clouds, and the positioning aligns with plausible anatomical aspects, reflecting intentional and artistic design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the vapor trails and eye swirls smoothly rendered and aligned with the cat’s facial contours, avoiding jagged lines or misplaced streaks that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features smoothly rendered vapor trails and eye swirls that complement the cat's facial contours. The transitions are seamless, without jagged lines or digital artifacts, indicating high-quality editing. The artist has maintained coherence in the visual elements, resulting in a harmonious appearance.",
