      "question": "Are the facial features on the central body aligned with the original angular design and free from visible texture artifacts or shape distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central body of the drone features what appears to be a robotic face, following a stylized and cartoonish depiction that diverges from realistic and angular design expectations. The facial features, such as the eyes and mouth, are clearly exaggerated and presented in a highly stylized manner, suggesting intentional distortion for artistic effect. There are no significant texture artifacts, but the inherent design is not angular as originally depicted in Image A, which was more of a realistic drone without such cartoonish elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the arms formed from rotor blades have consistent proportions and smooth joints that suggest functional rotation without visible warping or breakage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rotor blades have been transformed into arms for the stylized robotic figure. The proportions are exaggerated and cartoonish to match the overall theme, with no indication of functional rotation, which breaks away from functional realism. The joints appear smooth for the artistic style, but do not suggest mechanical functionality as they depart from the realistic representation of Image A. Therefore, the design choice implies decorative rather than functional assembly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the spider-like legs connected at the original landing gear locations and do they display coherent joint structures without gaps or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents a completely different design where the original landing gears of Image A do not seem to play any role in the new configuration seen in Image B. The new 'legs' stemming from the design do not adhere to the original placement or structural coherence that would reflect a 'spider-like' form, given their abstract, artistic representation. Gaps and coherence are not recognized due to stylization focusing on the robot art theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the lighting on the drone consistent with the futuristic cityscape background, showing appropriate metallic reflections and no harsh transitions between the drone and environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a vibrant, colorful portrayal of a futuristic hovering robot against a neon-lit cityscape backdrop. The lighting on the drone matches this background with brightly glowing features that complement the neon city lights and demonstrate a cohesive style. There are no harsh transitions noted, as the entire image uses a unified color palette typical of stylized animations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the speech bubble positioned near the robotic face with clear, legible text and no overlap with drone components or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubbles are placed around the robot figure, yet the text within them is distorted and not clearly readable as meaningful dialogue, likely the result of an intentional artistic choice. They are well-positioned spatially to avoid direct overlap with the drone components, maintaining a distinct separation from the background. However, the legibility criterion is not met due to the text itself being unclear.",
