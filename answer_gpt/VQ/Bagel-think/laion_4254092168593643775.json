      "question": "Does the silhouette of the rider maintain correct limb proportions and joint alignment without unnatural elongation or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the rider is stylized and appears as a solid color cutout. World knowledge indicates that a silhouette should ideally reflect accurate human proportions, but artistic representations sometimes deviate for stylization. In this case, the arms and legs of the rider seem simplified yet proportionate to common visual interpretations of human riding posture. Therefore, despite the artistic style, the silhouette maintains a reasonable depiction of proportions without obvious elongation or distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sand streaks in the background smoothly blended with the motion blur and do they follow the direction of travel without sharp, unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, comparing the edited sand streaks against world knowledge, they appear smoothly integrated with a sense of motion continuity. Motion blur typically signifies speed and direction, and the streaks in this image align with this principle, enhancing the sense of forward movement without abrupt or awkward interruptions. Thus, the sand streaks are consistent with the expected visual coherence.",

      "question": "Is the \"RaceFuel\" text clearly legible and positioned without obscuring key parts of the rider or motorcycle, and does it blend cohesively with the overall design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the placement and legibility of the \"RaceFuel\" text, it is designed to stand out using contrasting colors that harmonize with the overall energetic feel of the image. It is placed on the silhouette in a way that does not obscure crucial elements like the rider's pose or the motorcycle details. This strategic placement ensures the text serves its intended purpose without detracting from the visual impact of the main subjects.",

      "question": "Does the track outline in the upper-right corner form a continuous, closed loop without self-intersections or broken segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the track outline is examined for coherence and continuity. World knowledge suggests that race tracks are generally depicted in graphics as closed loops. In this image, the track outline indeed forms a continuous loop without broken segments or self-intersections, indicating a proper illustration of a racing path.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the speedometer icon positioned correctly at the bottom of the image with a clear, non-deformed dial and needle pointing to maximum speed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speedometer icon is not present at the bottom of the image, as it instead mimics the track's position at the upper right. Upon analyzing this detail, there is no dial or needle identifiable representing speed, which differs from what might be a common expectation in depicting speed indicators in visuals related to races or velocity.",
