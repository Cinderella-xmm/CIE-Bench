    "Question": "Q1: Do the skeletal wing-like extensions emerge naturally from the rock arch's edges without gaps, floating sections, or unnatural angles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skeletal wing-like extensions appear to be added artificially. They do not naturally emerge from the rock arch's edges, showing gaps and unnatural angles compared to what would be expected if they were part of the natural rock formation. The visual cues in the image suggest that these extensions do not align seamlessly with the existing structure, indicating an edited addition rather than a natural feature.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the crystalline growths along the archâ€™s curve textured and colored to blend with the surrounding rock, avoiding excessive gloss or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystalline growths are visible along the arch's curve. However, they exhibit a glossy texture and unnatural highlights that do not blend with the surrounding rock's natural coloration and texture. The added elements reflect a significant contrast to the original rock, making them stand out unnaturally.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the glowing veins across the surface follow natural mineral-like patterns and have soft, continuous light emission without jagged edges or blocky artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing veins are present across the surface. While attempting to mimic mineral-like patterns, they exhibit jagged edges and some blocky artifacts, deviating from a soft, continuous light emission that would be expected in a natural mineral formation. This suggests a digital addition rather than an organic occurrence.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the runic symbols on the inner surface of the arch carved into the rock with consistent depth and shadow, matching the texture of natural erosion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, no runic symbols are visible on the inner surface of the arch. Therefore, there are no carvings or consistent depth and shadow present to analyze if they were designed to match the texture of natural erosion. The absence means this edit is not applicable or present in the image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the radiant orb emit light that matches the ambient lighting direction and creates realistic soft shadows and reflections on adjacent rock surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the radiant orb is depicted as emitting light. However, the light emission does not completely match the ambient lighting direction as it fails to create realistic soft shadows and reflections on the adjacent rock surfaces. The lighting from the orb appears distinct, creating an unnatural appearance compared to the overall scene's natural lighting conditions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the ground textures, cracks, and soil near the base of the arch preserved and not obscured or distorted by the added elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ground textures, cracks, and soil near the base of the arch are mostly preserved, with the added elements primarily affecting the arch and the immediate vicinity of the radiant orb. The primary area of distortion and inclusion is farther up, with minimal impact on the ground's natural features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
