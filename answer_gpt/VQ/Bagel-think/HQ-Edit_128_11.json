      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sepia tone evenly applied across all surfaces, maintaining visible texture differences between materials such as the wooden floor, piano finish, and gilded ceiling, without introducing muddy or oversaturated areas?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a consistent sepia tone application across various surfaces. Each material, from the wooden floor to the piano finish and the ornate ceiling, retains distinct textures. There is no appearance of muddiness or oversaturation, allowing texture variations to stand out distinctly despite the unified color tone.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grand piano is correctly positioned on stage, maintaining a central alignment that matches the perspective of the scene.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is not clearly visible as it does not display a coherent or legible phrase, instead appearing as 'AN EVENING IN AMENE'. The inconsistent stroke weights and unaligned positioning interfere with the aesthetic of the background, blending poorly with the intricate ceiling pattern.",
