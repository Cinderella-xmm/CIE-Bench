    "Question": "Q1: Are the brushed metal and matte finishes applied consistently across the robot’s body without visible texture artifacts or inconsistent sheen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot appears to have consistent finishes across its body. The materials simulate real-world textures like brushed metal and matte surfaces, coming across clearly with a polished sheen appropriate to the lighting. There are no visible texture artifacts or areas where the sheen looks inconsistent. The finish is smooth and professionally done, suggesting an attentive application of material properties.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the hexagonal box fully enclosed around the robot with clean edges, proper proportions, and a clearly legible 'MECHA VANGUARD' label without distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no presence of a hexagonal box enclosing the robot. The scene is presented on a flat background with a cityscape design, and there is no visible label saying 'MECHA VANGUARD.' Therefore, the hexagonal box with the described features is not part of the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the engraved details on the armor plates and weapon surfaces clear and non-blurry, and do the joint areas (elbows, knees) show no signs of geometric distortion or missing segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the engraved details on the armor plates and weapon surfaces appear clear and non-blurry, demonstrating high-resolution artwork typical of CGI renderings of technology-focused subjects. Joint areas at the elbows and knees are depicted accurately with no geometric distortions or missing segments, reflecting careful modeling work.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the cityscape background extend behind the robot without clipping through its limbs or body, and does it match the lighting direction and scale of the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cityscape background extends properly behind the robot, aligning with the robot's position without any clipping issues. The background matches the scene's scale and lighting direction, integrating well with the robot's pose and perspective, enhancing the sense of realism and depth in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the robot’s limbs, weapons, and armor pieces correctly aligned and positioned without overlapping or floating elements that violate spatial logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot’s limbs, weapons, and armor pieces are well-aligned and correctly positioned, maintaining spatial logic. There are no indications of overlapping or floating elements. Each component is carefully modeled and integrated into the scene, reflecting a cohesive and realistic design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
