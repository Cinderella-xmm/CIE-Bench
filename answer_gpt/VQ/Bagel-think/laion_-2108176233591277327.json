      "question": "Does the transformed object maintain a continuous, symmetrical egg-like shape with no visible breaks, jagged edges, or misaligned contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a central object that resembles an egg shape with a uniform and symmetrical contour. There are no noticeable breaks, jagged edges, or misaligned contours in the shape as it appears smooth and well-defined. The consistent symmetry and smoothness indicate a maintenance of the intended egg-like form. This conclusion is drawn by assessing the visible curves and the balance in its shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the feather-like patterns seamlessly integrated into the surface, with consistent line thickness, shading, and color gradients matching the original level of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feather-like patterns on the object are intricately detailed, displaying consistent line thickness and shading. The integration appears smooth, and the feathers exhibit a gradient of color that matches the depth and detail expected in high-quality design. By examining the pattern consistency and the harmonious blend with the object, it demonstrates a high level of detail much like traditional artistic motifs.",

      "question": "Is the wing-shaped handle smoothly connected to the body of the egg, with realistic feather layers and no visible gaps or distortions in its curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wing-shaped handle in Image B shows a smooth transition to the egg's body; the connection appears natural with no visible gaps or distortions. The feather layers along the handle are portrayed with realistic depth and overlap, contributing to a genuine appearance without disrupting the overall curve. Through observing the seamless blending and continuity in the design, it reflects realistic craftsmanship.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the nest-like rim have a layered, organic structure with consistent material texture and properly placed jewel accents that do not appear displaced or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nest-like rim in Image B demonstrates a layered and organic structure with detailed texturing similar to natural materials. The jewel accents are strategically placed, appearing firmly and properly placed within the rimâ€™s structure, without any indication of them floating or being out of place. By analyzing the placement and texture consistency, it aligns with realistic expectations for such designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing embers produce a subtle luminous effect that enhances the patterns without causing blurring, color bleeding, or unnatural highlights on adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing embers in Image B emit a soft luminosity that enhances the overall design without introducing blurring or color bleeding into adjacent areas. The effect is balanced, with the glow complementing the patterns on the egg's surface without distorting the visual quality of other elements. This observation is based on the precise illumination control within the image, sustaining detail clarity while adding a visual enhancement.",
