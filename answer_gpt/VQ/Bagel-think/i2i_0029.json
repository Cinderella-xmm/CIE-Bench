      "question": "Do the extended stripes seamlessly blend into the grass without creating unnatural textures or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the extended stripes from the zebra do not blend seamlessly into the grassy environment. Instead, they continue past the zebra's body and cover the surrounding environment, creating a striking and surreal texture that differs significantly from natural grass. The pattern and texture of the stripes disrupt the expected natural look of the grass, creating an unnatural scene. Therefore, based on the visual cues and common sense understanding of what grass typically looks like, the stripes do not blend smoothly into the grass.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stripes extended in a way that preserves the original geometric structure and proportions of the zebra's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are extended beyond the body's typical boundaries and are transformed into a more abstract, surreal representation. The original geometric structure and proportions of the zebra's stripes are altered, as they now occupy the entire visual space and transform it beyond the conventional anatomical confines. This surreal extension changes the perception of the original proportions, so the stripes do not preserve the geometric structure of the zebra's body.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a visually credible composition where the zebra remains the focal point without being overshadowed by the surreal extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the zebra itself is still discernible, the surreal extension of its stripes dominates the image, overshadowing the zebra's presence. The extension fills the entire background, drawing attention away from the zebra and becoming the main element of the composition. Thus, the original focal point is diluted by the abstract design of the surrounding environment, making the surreal stripes more prominent than the zebra itself.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are key features of the zebra such as its mane, ears, and legs still clearly visible and natural looking amidst the surreal extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mane, ears, and legs of the zebra remain distinctly visible, retaining their natural appearance despite the surreal extension of the stripes around them. These anatomical features are clearly illustrated and do not appear distorted or altered in a way that looks unnatural. The key features are discernible and maintain a natural look amidst the extended stripe patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the zebra's stripes and the grass been preserved without noticeable degradation or introduction of artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the zebra's stripes are extended and turned into a surreal background, their fine details are preserved to some extent. However, the environment around the zebra, originally grass, has been transformed into this surreal stripe pattern which alters its natural texture and details, introducing an artistic effect rather than preserving its natural state. As such, the grass and surrounding detail are not preserved in their original form, which may be viewed as degradation or introduction of new patterns/artifacts.",
