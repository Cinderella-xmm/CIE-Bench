      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cogwheel curls integrated into the hairline without distorting the shape of the head or breaking the continuity of the scalp surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cogwheels on the hairstyle appear to seamlessly integrate with the hairline, maintaining the overall shape of the head. The cogwheels are suitably aligned and follow the hairline, creating a coherent and smooth transition along the scalp surface. By blending mechanical elements with classical features, the sculptural form remains intact, without visible breaks or distortions in the curvature of the scalp.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic fabric folds follow the natural contours of the shoulders and chest without unnatural stretching or buckling, and are the rivets and tubes placed in physically plausible locations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic fabric folds follow the natural contours of the shoulders and chest in a manner that appears coherent with the anatomical shape, maintaining form without unusual stretching or buckling. The rivets and tubes are strategically positioned in areas where clothing seams or embellishments might naturally occur, supporting the overall structure without defying physical plausibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the watch parts and gears attached to the base in a stable and symmetrical arrangement without overlapping or floating elements that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the watch parts and gears affixed symmetrically and in a balanced array, ensuring stability in design without the presence of floating or overlapping components. The mechanical items are arranged in a manner that respects the physical laws, with logically consistent placement that complements the existing structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the monocle mechanism positioned flush with the eye socket and connected to the face via visible but plausible mechanical joints, without altering the shape of the surrounding facial bones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a monocle mechanism placed appropriately within the space of the eye socket, suggesting precision without seeming distortion to the structural arrangement of the facial bones. The mechanical joints are clearly visible and appear to connect seamlessly without altering the skeletal outline.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bronze and copper tones uniformly applied across all modified elements, with realistic reflections and no abrupt color boundaries or flat, non-metallic areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bronze and copper tones are evenly distributed across all modified components, yielding a seamless metallic look with realistic highlights and reflections. There are no evident abrupt transitions or flat regions that would interfere with the cohesive metallic appearance. The color application is thorough, adding depth and realism to the modified design.",
