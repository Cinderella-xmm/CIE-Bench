      "question": "Do the zebras maintain their signature striped coats with no unnatural texture or loss of detail in the chibi-style 3D recreation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi-style 3D recreation (Image B), the zebras retain their signature striped coats, but the texture and detail appear more stylized and simplified compared to the realistic depiction seen in Image A. Chibi-style typically involves exaggeration and simplification of details, which can be seen here where the stripes are clearer and more uniform, but without the same level of texture detail. The coats are still recognizably zebra-like, but there is a loss of realistic texture in favor of a smooth, cartoon-like finish.",

      "question": "Are the lush green field and fencing preserved in a photorealistic manner without any visible distortion or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the field and fencing are depicted in a simplified, cartoon-like style rather than a photorealistic one. The grass and sky have been rendered in solid colors with less texture contrast, and the fence is more uniform and minimalistic, typical of chibi art. Comparing this with the realistic texture and detail of Image Aâ€™s grass and wood fence, Image B lacks the photorealistic quality.",

      "question": "Do the zebras retain their realistic grazing stances without any distortion or deformation in the chibi-style 3D recreation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi-style 3D recreation (Image B), while the zebras are depicted in grazing stances similar to those in Image A, their postures have been adjusted to fit a stylized, more exaggerated and cute aesthetic typical of chibi art. The body proportions and head sizes are altered, leading to a more cartoonish appearance rather than a realistic one. This involves some deformation from their natural look, but it is intentional for the style.",

      "question": "Does the ornate decorative photo frame integrate seamlessly with the scene without disrupting the visual coherence or introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of an ornate decorative photo frame around the scene in Image B complements the chibi-style 3D art and enhances the overall presentation without introducing any visible artifacts or disrupting the coherence. The frame seems intentionally placed to match the stylized theme, and it integrates well aesthetically.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition between the chibi-style 3D zebras and the photorealistic background smooth and believable without any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the chibi-style 3D zebras and the background is not seamless or believable if expected to blend into a photorealistic setting. Both the zebras and their environment have undergone a similar transformation into a stylized, cartoon appearance. Consequently, while they are visually coherent within the chibi context, the question implies a mismatch with photorealism which the image does not attempt, as both foreground and background follow a stylized aesthetic.",
