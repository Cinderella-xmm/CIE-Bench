      "question": "Is the head of the character significantly larger than the body, with smooth, consistent scaling across facial features and neck, avoiding jagged edges or inconsistent proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character displays typical proportions of a chibi style where the head is disproportionately larger than the body. This is a common feature designed to enhance cuteness. The facial features are scaled consistently with smooth lines and lack jagged edges or inconsistent proportions, suggesting intentional design choices.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character with hands that appear to have stylized fingers, compatible with chibi art, where fingers might not be individually delineated due to their small size. The arms and legs are proportionally shortened to match the chibi style, displaying smooth curves and joints without signs of unnatural bending or breaks.",
