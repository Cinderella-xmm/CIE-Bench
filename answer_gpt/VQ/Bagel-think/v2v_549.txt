    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi-style Funko Pop figure maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the baseball player's pose and attire without introducing unnatural distortions?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a Funko Pop figure, which is intentionally designed to have exaggerated and disproportionate features (such as a large head and small body) characteristic of chibi-style figures. The pose and attire are simplified to match that toy design style. While this is not realistic in a traditional sense, it is true to the expected design of a Funko Pop toy, which purposefully incorporates unnatural proportions as part of its aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the detailed textures and lighting of the realistic depiction of the figure outside the box natural and consistent with the lighting and textures in the original image?",
    "explanation": "The depiction of the Funko Pop figure outside the box captures uniform lighting but lacks the photo-realistic texture detail present in Image A. This is expected since it is a toy figure styled as a cartoonish character, and Funko Pop figures traditionally have smooth surfaces rather than the textured surfaces seen in realistic images. Hence, textures match the style but not the realism of Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there an absence of unnatural textures or loss of fine details where the chibi-style figure transitions to the realistic depiction of the figure outside the box?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure and its depiction outside the box maintain the same smooth and simplified textures expected from a Funko Pop figure. These textures lack fine details and do not lead to any awkward transitions, as both the boxed and unboxed characters present the same level of detail consistent with toy design. There are no losses of expected detail in the transition as there is no expected transition between chibi style and realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the Funko Pop-style box and its elements (ball, glove, title) integrate naturally with the overall scene without disrupting the visual credibility?",
    "explanation": "The Funko Pop-style box is designed to resemble typical retail packaging for collectible figures. Visual elements like the baseball motif and the figure's glove, along with the fictional branding, create a cohesive representation within the context of novelty items. Though it contrasts with realistic Image A, its design does not visually disrupt the expectation of what a Funko Pop product represents, given the expected artistic license.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the isometric view of the Funko Pop-style box preserve the structural integrity and avoid any broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "The isometric view of the Funko Pop-style box in Image B retains clear, straight-edge geometric shapes typical of box outlines. No visual errors such as skewed lines or mismatched angles are evident, and the structural representation maintains its visual integrity, suggesting that the box is well-preserved in terms of geometry.",
    "answer": "Yes"
