      "question": "Does the ship retain its original structural shape and proportion when rendered as part of a spherical globe, without visible warping or stretching of the hull or sails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To analyze Image B, I observe that the ship inside the globe maintains its structural shape and proportion, resembling an accurate miniature without distortion. Common sense tells us that objects within a snow globe often retain their original form despite the curvature of the glass. Comparing with Image A, which shows the full ship in natural proportions, Image B doesn't show any visible warping from the spherical effect. The visual cues align well with this understanding.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass dome transparent with realistic reflections and refractions, and does the wooden base display natural wood grain and intricate compass engravings without pixelation or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome appears transparent, exhibiting realistic reflections and refractions, indicative of high-quality rendering. The wooden base shows a natural wood grain with detailed, intricate compass engravings. Observing these features, it's apparent they are well executed without any indication of pixelation or repetitive textures. Using world knowledge, these qualities are typically associated with skilled craftsmanship in glass and wood designs.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sea creatures clearly visible beneath the ship, properly scaled, and positioned in a manner consistent with underwater motion, without appearing floating unnaturally or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image, Image B, the sea creatures are visible beneath the ship, exhibiting proper scaling which suggests realism in a miniature globe setting. Their positioning is consistent with underwater motion, as common sense and world knowledge indicate how aquatic forms behave underwater. There is no visual evidence of unnatural floating or distortion in their appearance. This understanding helps verify the realism within this art context.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sails exhibit fine fabric details such as wrinkles and weave patterns that align with the lighting direction and do not show unnatural seams or repeating patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the sails display fine fabric details including wrinkles and weave patterns, indicative of realistic textile rendering. These details correspond well with the direction of lighting, supporting a natural appearance. From common experience and textile knowledge, such details validate high execution quality without unnatural seams or repetitive patterns that might disrupt realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the internal clouds smoothly shaped and distributed within the dome without clipping into the ship or glass surface, and do they have soft edges and luminous quality consistent with being lit from above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the internal clouds are smoothly shaped and distributed within the globe. They do not clip into the ship or glass surface, giving a clean visual separation. The clouds possess soft edges and a luminous quality, which suggest they are appropriately lit from above. This follows world knowledge of cloud formation and lighting in artistic domains or model-making, where light plays a pivotal role in defining shape and depth without overlapping object space.",
