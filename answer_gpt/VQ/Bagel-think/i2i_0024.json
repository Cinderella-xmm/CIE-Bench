      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure maintain the correct body proportions without any unnatural stretching or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the chibi-style figure shows the typical characteristics associated with chibi art: a smaller body compared to the head, large eyes, and simplified facial features. These proportions match the style, which often exaggerates certain features for artistic purposes. There is no indication of stretching or distortion beyond what is typical for this art form. Therefore, based on these observations, we conclude the body proportions are correct for the chibi style.",
