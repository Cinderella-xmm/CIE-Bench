    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the petal shapes preserved with jagged crystal facets that follow the natural curvature of the original lily petals, without visible warping or geometric breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal petals display jagged edges that trace the natural outline of flower petals, resembling stylized versions of natural forms found in lilies. This replication maintains smooth transitions across the curves, without introducing irregularities or geometric anomalies. The jagged facets add dimension while preserving the natural curvature seen in live petals.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glass rods extend naturally from the vase upward, matching the number and spacing of the original stems, without appearing disconnected or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows glass rods that originate from the vase, extending upwards with consistent alignment and spacing similar to the stems in Image A. The transition from vase to rods is visually seamless, with no signs of misalignment or disconnection. This reflects an organized structure reminiscent of plant stems.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black marble surface beneath the vase smooth, uniformly dark, and reflective, with shadows and highlights consistent with the light source and object placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black marble surface exhibits smooth, dark qualities with reflective properties. The presence of shadows and highlights on the marble corresponds with the direction and intensity of available lighting, suggesting a polished surface. These details are coherent with the set-up found under Image B's lighting conditions and object placement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the crystal petals exhibit subtle variations in amber hue and transparency, with internal light refractions and depth cues that suggest volume and translucency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates crystal petals exhibiting nuanced amber hues and varying Degrees of transparency. These ensure each petal has visual depth and translucency characteristic of glass materials. The internal reflections contribute to the perception of volume, enhancing the artistic rendition of natural flower petals.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glass rods enter the water at angles consistent with refraction, showing slight bending at the waterline, and remain submerged without floating or disappearing mid-length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass rods extend into the water with observable bending at waterlines, attributed to light refraction phenomena. These rods continue visibly below the water surface without interruption or floating, maintaining realistic representations of submerged objects. The continuity ensures coherent visual and structural representation similar to true stems in water.",
