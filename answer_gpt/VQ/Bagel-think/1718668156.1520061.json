    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the tall glass on the right display consistent pixelated and circuit-like textures across its surface without visible cracks, jagged edges, or inconsistent rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tall glass in Image B shows a circuit-like texture that is uniform across its surface. This design choice reflects the neon and digital theme. The patterns are regular, without visible noise or inconsistencies, suggesting a controlled application of texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the outlines of the Sydney Opera House composed of continuous, evenly spaced neon lines that maintain the correct number and shape of the shell structures without misalignment or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neon outlines of the Sydney Opera House in Image B are bright and continuous, maintaining the iconic shape, number, and arrangement of the shells. The neon effects seem intentionally designed without gaps or misalignments, presenting a stylized yet accurate representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wave patterns in the water consist of uniform, repeating geometric shapes that align horizontally and vertically without overlapping irregularly or creating gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water is depicted with geometric wave patterns that are consistent and align horizontally and vertically. These patterns do not show inconsistencies like overlaps or gaps, suggesting careful design to evoke a digital aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the beverage in the shorter glass show a consistent holographic effect with subtle layering and refraction, without distorting the shape of the ice cubes or causing unnatural transparency gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beverage in the shorter glass in Image B appears with normal lighting, and does not show a holographic effect. The illumination reflects typical refraction from being backlit by a neon environment. However, the ice cubes maintain their shape, showcasing realistic transparency without unnatural gradients.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the two glasses aligned with the direction of the sunset lighting, and do they match the apparent position of the sun in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene appears to be digitally altered to a nighttime aesthetic, suggesting the absence of natural sunlight. Consequently, the visible shadows wouldn't correlate with sunset lighting or the sun's position as it was modified to neon illumination, making alignment unlikely.",
