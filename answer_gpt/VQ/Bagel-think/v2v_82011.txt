    "Question": "Q1: Do the bold calligraphic outlines and flat planes of color on the dolls' clothing and hair maintain the original proportions and positions without introducing unnatural distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bold calligraphic outlines and flat planes of color are stylistically typical of Ukiyo-e, which uses such features to represent figures without distorting their essential shapes or proportions. The dolls' clothing and hair appear consistent with their original proportions when compared to Image A, maintaining a uniformity without any unnatural alterations.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the textures of the dolls' skin and hair free from unnatural artifacts and maintain a natural appearance after the style transformation?",
    "explanation": "Image B employs an artistic style where textures are rendered in a flat, illustrative manner typical of Ukiyo-e art. While this approach reduces details, it does not introduce artifacts but rather supports stylistic uniformity, maintaining the dolls' skin and hair in a coherent, natural appearance aligned with the artistic motif. This depiction is without unnatural artifacts given the artistic context.",
