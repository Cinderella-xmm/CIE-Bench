    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the wood-carved hat and scarf clearly distinguishable from the original fabric textures, with consistent grain patterns and engraved details that follow natural wood structure without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and scarf are designed to appear as carved wood instead of fabric. The engravings feature sharp, precise lines and patterns that mimic traditional wood carving details, maintaining consistent grain patterns typical of wood. This clarity suggests the objects are intended to look wooden, differing significantly from soft fabric textures, thus adhering to the natural structure without distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks form a continuous, anatomically plausible layer over the dog’s body without gaps, overlapping inconsistencies, or floating pieces that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks are constructed to fit around the dog's body coherently. They create a logical layer over the dog's body shape, and the connection between bricks appears continuous without apparent gaps or illogical overlaps. The assembly looks stable and realistic, respecting physical laws.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the light-colored wooden tabletop background evenly lit and seamlessly integrated with the subject, without abrupt transitions or shadow mismatches that suggest poor compositing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a smooth wooden tabletop that matches well with the lighting conditions of the subject. The lighting is evenly distributed, with shadows and highlights blending naturally into the scene, indicating good compositing and integration without mismatches.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ear flaps of the wood-carved hat properly shaped and positioned symmetrically on both sides of the dog’s head, without deformation or disproportionate scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ear flaps of the hat are symmetrically shaped and positioned on each side of the dog’s head. They maintain a natural and proportionate appearance, fitting well with the dog's head shape without evident deformation or scaling issues that would disrupt symmetry.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks exhibit consistent edge definition, proper shading, and logical placement across the dog’s body, avoiding blocky artifacts or color clumps that break visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO bricks in Image B are precisely defined with consistent shading that captures the light source effectively to create depth and dimension. They are logically placed across the dog’s body, maintaining visual integrity without artifacts or color inconsistencies to disrupt continuity.",
