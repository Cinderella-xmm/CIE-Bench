    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the magnifying glass placed among the books on the left bookshelf visually consistent in size, shape, and material, with a shadow extending toward the desk that matches the lighting direction from the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual cues show the presence of a magnifying glass among the books on the left bookshelf. It appears consistent in size, shape, and material typical of a classic magnifying glass. The lighting in the image comes from the window, directing light towards the desk. However, there is no visible magnifying glass in the bookshelf area, suggesting it may not have been included or not realistically integrated with proper shadows.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the ghostly outline of the detective in a trench coat appear as a translucent, softly blended form within the stained-glass window pattern, maintaining the integrity of the original design and showing no jagged edges or inconsistent opacity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ghostly outline of a detective is present, positioned near the stained-glass window. The form appears translucent and integrates with the window's stained glass without disrupting its pattern. The edges are soft, maintaining consistent opacity with no visible jagged edges, suggesting a well-blended integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the deep sepia tones applied consistently across all surfaces including the wooden desk, bookshelves, floor, and window, preserving fine details like wood grain and book spines without introducing blotchy or uneven color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sepia tones are prominent throughout the image on various surfaces such as the wooden desk, bookshelves, floor, and window. The fine details, such as wood grain and book spines, remain clear, indicating an even application of color without blotchiness or uneven patches, upheld by the preservation of intricate details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the title \"The Lost Legacy\" positioned at the top of the image in a bold serif font that is clearly legible, proportionally scaled, and seamlessly overlaid without obscuring the ceiling details or causing visual disruption to the surrounding ornate patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title present at the top of the image reads 'THE TAHE BRICDERS,' which is different from 'The Lost Legacy.' The title is in a bold serif font and is legible but slightly disrupts the visual alignment with the window and ceiling details. It causes some interference with the surrounding ornate patterns due to its position and style.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the added elements—the magnifying glass and the ghostly figure—integrate seamlessly into the scene without distorting adjacent objects, altering lighting logic, or introducing visible artifacts such as misaligned edges or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the added ghostly figure seems to integrate well without disrupting the window's pattern, there is no visible magnifying glass placed among the books on the left bookshelf, indicating a lack of integration. The ghostly figure is added without apparent distortion of nearby objects or lighting issues, but the absence of the magnifying glass or its mismatched integration suggests a lack of seamlessness in the combination of elements.",
