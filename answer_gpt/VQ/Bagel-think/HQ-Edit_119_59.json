      "question": "Do the exaggerated arms maintain anatomical plausibility with visible muscle groups that follow natural contours and joint alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B features a stylized representation commonly seen in caricatures or cartoons, which tend to exaggerate certain features like muscle size while sacrificing anatomical realism. The arms are larger and rounded, lacking the detailed muscle definition and joint alignment seen in reality. They do not follow the natural contours one would expect anatomically, as seen in the more realistic depiction of Image A.",

      "question": "Are the gym-themed motifs on the tank top and shorts clearly rendered with consistent material properties and no overlapping or fragmented textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gym-themed motifs are stylized and have a cartoon-like consistency. The material properties are simplified, focusing on clear outlines and colorful designs, which do not overlap or appear fragmented. The motif 'TASTY' is visible without overlapping textures. Comparing with Image A, the realistic rendering of the clothes highlights material texture and shading.",

      "question": "Are the colorful icons positioned symmetrically on both sides of the barbell and aligned with the barâ€™s axis without appearing detached or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, colorful icons such as dumbbells and circles appear to be part of a calendar strip design, positioned symmetrically along the bottom. While artistic in nature, they are aligned with the barbell's axis without distortion. This symmetry is an intentional stylized feature distinct from Image A, which focuses on realism and lacks such icons.",

      "question": "Do the shadow illustrations in the mirror maintain consistent lighting direction and depth relative to the main subject and surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror reflection does not adhere to realistic shadow illustrations. The stylized depiction avoids intricate details like light direction and depth, focusing more on straightforward visual appeal than realism. Image A provides a more accurate representation of lighting direction and depth relative to the subject based on realistic reflection principles.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the calendar strip aligned horizontally along the bottom edge of the panel and sized appropriately to match the scale of the figure and surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a calendar strip at the base, which is balanced horizontally with the panel, fitting well with the scale and proportions of the illustrated figure and setting. This strip, with its icons, is consistent with the proportions of the overall stylized artwork. In comparison, Image A lacks such an element, focusing instead on realism without added graphic components.",
