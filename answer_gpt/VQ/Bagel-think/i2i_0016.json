      "question": "Are the clothing and hairstyle features of the players accurately represented in chibi form without artificial or distorted textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi characters in Image B have hairstyles that correspond closely to the players' original looks in Image A. The one on the left has her hair tied up, resembling the original player's ponytail, while the one on the right has a similar hairstyle to the player. The clothing, particularly the sleeveless tops and shorts or skirts, are simplified into chibi form but still retain the core characteristics of the original attire, without any artificial or distorted textures present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi representation, the handshake pose between the players is correctly depicted with each character having a standard number of fingers—four fingers and a thumb—on each hand, maintaining anatomical accuracy in terms of finger count and position during the handshake.",

      "question": "Does the semi-transparent tennis court logo integrate smoothly into the background without creating distracting artifacts or distorting the tennis court?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The logo in Image B is positioned centrally behind the chibi characters and appears semi-transparent. It integrates well into the background, serving as a decorative element without introducing any distortion to the court lines or other features. There are no distracting artifacts; the logo complements the chibi design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tennis rackets proportionally appropriate for the chibi characters and clearly identifiable as tennis rackets without any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tennis rackets in the chibi form are proportionally smaller to match the character size but are still easily recognizable as tennis rackets. They maintain a shape consistent with tennis rackets shown in Image A and do not display any unnatural distortions, ensuring the elements are coherent with the context of tennis.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details like facial expressions and clothing patterns on the chibi characters been preserved without significant loss or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi characters typically feature simplified design elements, yet in Image B, facial expressions are drawn clearly with distinct eyes, eyebrows, and mouths. The clothing patterns, while simpler, replicate the design intent from Image A, avoiding any significant loss in detailing or displaying unnatural smoothing, which aligns with typical chibi aesthetics.",
