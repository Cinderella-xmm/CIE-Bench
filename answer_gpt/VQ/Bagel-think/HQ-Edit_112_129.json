      "question": "Does the glass dome have natural transparency and refraction effects that match the lighting direction and shadow patterns from the window, without visible artifacts such as uneven edges or unrealistic glare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears to have clear transparency and refraction effects that are consistent with the lighting direction and shadow patterns, as evidenced by the light source visible through the dome and the clarity of objects behind it. The boundaries of the dome are smooth and without irregular edges or excessively bright glare, indicating an effective rendering of glass properties.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the vintage wooden base visually consistent in color, texture, and grain pattern with the surrounding wooden table, and does the velvet lining appear soft and layered without pixelation or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base shares similar color tones, texture, and grain patterns with the surrounding wooden table, suggesting consistency and harmony in the scene. The velvet lining appears soft, has natural layering, and lacks any notable harsh pixelation or unnatural sheen, emphasizing quality rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the flowering plants and ferns emerging from the spout and lid grow in a way that follows natural botanical form and maintains contact with the teapot's surface without floating or breaking geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't depict plants emerging from the spout or lid; therefore, there's no analysis regarding adherence to botanical form or geometric continuity. There are no visual cues suggesting such additions.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the butterflies positioned at plausible flight heights and angles near the floral engravings, with visible wings and body details that match the scale and lighting of the scene, and do they cast subtle shadows on the teapot surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterflies in Image B are positioned in a manner that suggests natural flight heights and angles relative to the teapot, with detailed wings and bodies. The lighting matches the scene, and subtle shadows cast on the teapot enhance realism and integration.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added elements, including the base and butterflies, are depicted in muted earth tones which harmonize with the silver teapot and wooden background. The colors blend seamlessly, avoiding any distracting contrasts or brightness that could disturb the visual coherence of the image.",
