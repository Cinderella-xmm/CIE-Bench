      "question": "Are the butterfly wings proportionally sized relative to the woman’s body and positioned naturally behind her shoulders without overlapping or distorting her silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings are large and artistically rendered to resemble a decorative background panel, fitting the whimsical and stylized nature of the edited image. The wings are positioned symmetrically behind the woman's shoulders, aligning naturally and enhancing the visual harmony without distorting her silhouette. This indicates an intended integration with her body, which suits the art style and theme presented.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the butterfly wings display consistent and detailed textures across their surfaces, with no visible artifacts such as jagged edges, repeated patterns, or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B are part of a stylized artistic depiction, characterized by smooth and consistent textures typical of hand-painted or digitally rendered illustrations. There are no artifacts such as jagged edges or repeated patterns disrupting the wing design. The shading is deliberately uniform and natural for the intended art style, which supports a cohesive visual presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the woman’s body maintain natural proportions, with no exaggerated limbs, distorted joints, or disproportionate head size that would compromise visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the woman's body is rendered in a stylized manner that reflects intentional artistic choices. Her proportions are consistent with simplified illustrative styles, with no visibly exaggerated limbs or distorted joints. Her overall silhouette is harmonious, aligning with the illustration norms observed in similar artworks, thereby maintaining visual credibility within its context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the gold embroidery on the red dress clearly defined, textured appropriately, and integrated into the fabric without appearing flat, misplaced, or disconnected from the material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress features distinct patterns that suggest embroidered details. These details are clearly defined and tightly integrated into the fabric's design, although portrayed in a simplified manner to fit the artistic style of the overall image. The integration is seamless, avoiding a flat appearance, which is typical for stylized art where realistic texture may be less emphasized for aesthetic purposes.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the months displayed on the wings clearly legible, properly aligned, and integrated into the wing design without disrupting the wing’s shape or causing visual conflicts such as overlapping or floating text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no evidence of any months being displayed on the butterfly wings. The wings instead focus on maintaining their artistic and decorative aspects, without the inclusion of text. This ensures the design's integrity and avoids any disruptions caused by additional elements.",
