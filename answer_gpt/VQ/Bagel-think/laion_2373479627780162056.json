      "question": "Does the suit jacket exhibit watercolor-style blue-black tones with smooth transitions and no visible digital artifacts such as jagged edges or unnatural blotches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit jacket has been transformed into an artistic representation with blue-black watercolor tones. Upon close examination, surfaces appear smooth with transition areas between colors showing gradual shifts without evident digital artifacts or unnatural blotches, thus embracing a watercolor painting style which is usually characterized by smooth transitions and harmonious color blending.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the golden pinstripes aligned with the suit’s fabric grain and do they reflect light consistently with the surrounding material, avoiding floating or misaligned lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B closely, there is no evidence of golden pinstripes visible on the suit fabric. The artistic interpretation lacks any detailed rendering such as pinstripes that would suggest alignment with fabric grain or consistent light reflection.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the pattern on the tie uniformly distributed, maintaining consistent size and spacing across its surface without stretching or repeating errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tie is depicted with a pattern represented in a stylized manner. The pattern quality appears stretched with inconsistencies across the surface, not maintaining uniformity or consistent spacing. Such variations suggest an artistic interpretation rather than precise uniform distribution seen in realistic tie patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the leather-bound border feature realistic texture details such as stitching, grain, and embossed lettering without warping or clipping the subject’s features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leather-bound border includes texture elements and some form of lettering. The texture details do include stitching and grain elements but lack precision and realism typically expected from genuine leather products. The artistic execution results in some warping effects; therefore, it doesn't fully achieve the semblance of realistic texture without impacting or clipping within the image scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background and surface of the image show a soft, uniform satin paper texture with subtle reflections, avoiding harsh glare or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backdrop and surface in Image B demonstrate more artistic elements than practical material depiction. While aiming for a uniform appearance, subtle reflections are apparent; however, the execution leaves areas without a fully blended and consistent satin texture and occasional harsh areas or pixelation, typical results of such artistic renditions.",
