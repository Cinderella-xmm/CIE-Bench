    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the steps now display a series of uniformly sized, overlapping scale-like segments that follow the spiral path without visible gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steps have not been altered in a way that they display overlapping scale-like segments. The steps still show their original marble or stone texture, similar to how they're arranged in a continuous pattern typical of spiral staircases. There is no indication of scale-like segmentation as asked in the question.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the railing now form a continuous, gently curving spine-like structure with consistent thickness and no abrupt changes in direction or width?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railing has been edited to display a more decorative and intricate design, resembling a continuous spine-like structure. The modifications include groove patterns resembling vertebrae but maintain the general spiral curvature of the original structure. The changes do make it appear more spine-like, notably with consistent thickness and smooth curvature.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wooden patterns applied to the spine consistent in tone, grain, and texture with the original railing, and do they appear as an integral part of the structure rather than a separate overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railing exhibits a new wooden pattern that differs from the original, which was a uniform dark wood. The edited pattern introduces more texture and segmented appearance, which makes it stand out rather than integrating seamlessly. The new pattern appears more as an overlay due to its distinct design, suggesting a deviation from the original tone and grain.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the stone-like ridges aligned along the outer edge of the spiral coils and smoothly integrated into the surface, without appearing detached or misaligned with the underlying form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no distinct addition of stone-like ridges along the outer edge of the spiral coils. The focus is more on the railings and not on the steps or any additional ridges that may appear misaligned. Thus, the mention of stone-like ridges does not apply to the edits observed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the spiral coils decrease in size proportionally toward the center, maintaining smooth curvature and even spacing without compression or stretching that distorts the spiral shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B still maintains the proportional decrease in size of the spiral coils towards the center, just as in Image A. The edits to the railing have not affected the basic structure of the spiral staircase. The spiral curvature is preserved with consistent spacing, exhibiting a smoothly curving structure without any distortion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do shadows and highlights on the scales, spine, and ridges follow the contours of the new surface structure, matching the direction and intensity of ambient light from above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the adjustments to the railing's texture and pattern have introduced shadows and highlights that complement the curved surface. However, because the question refers to scales and ridges that aren't present, the answer must rely solely on the newly introduced railing pattern aligning with ambient light. The lighting seems consistent and naturally follows the contours of the structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the edges of the scale segments, spinal bones, and stone ridges clearly defined and free from blurring, aliasing, or stair-stepping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the railing has been modified to resemble a spinal form, the resolution and clarity of the edited design remain intact, showing defined edges without noticeable blurring or aliasing. The design is clear and appears to be well-integrated without major distortion artifacts, aligning with the question's criteria.",
