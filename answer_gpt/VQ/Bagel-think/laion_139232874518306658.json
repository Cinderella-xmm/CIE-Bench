      "question": "Do the enlarged shopping bags retain their original geometric shapes without distorted edges or broken polygons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shopping bags are depicted with clear geometric shapes that appear consistent with typical rectangular forms expected from shopping bags. Their edges are straight, and there are no visible distortions or broken lines in the shape of the bags. World knowledge suggests that shopping bags are usually rectangular, which aligns with their depiction in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the velvety texture on the coat uniformly applied without unnatural shine or inconsistent surface details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the coat's texture as velvety, which is indicated by smooth, matte surfaces without any shine that would suggest a different material like leather or silk. The texture appears uniform, and the lighting does not create any unnatural highlights, consistent with the coat's intended material.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glossy gloves visually consistent in shape and reflection, with no distorted finger joints or misplaced highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gloves exhibit a consistent glossy finish typical of leather gloves. The reflections on the gloves are even, and there are no distortions indicating inaccuracies in the finger joints or shape. Highlights on glossy surfaces are straightforward; thus, any misplaced highlights would suggest editing errors, which are absent here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the abstract retail symbols positioned around the subject without overlapping or intersecting with her body or shopping bags?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes various abstract shopping symbols scattered around the subject. They are positioned in such a way that they float in the background space, not physically overlapping or intersecting with the subject's body or the shopping bags, which suggests a careful placement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the open panel for personal messages blend seamlessly into the background with matching lighting and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show an explicit open panel for personal messages. Therefore, itâ€™s assumed there is no such element requiring assessment in Image B. Any potential blending would involve analyzing how well elements match the background lighting and texture, but since no such panel appears, the question is inapplicable.",
