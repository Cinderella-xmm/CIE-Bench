      "question": "Does the enlarged head appear natural and maintain structural coherence without distortion or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head appears to have been transformed into a stylized, exaggerated form typical of cartoon depictions. This kind of alteration inherently introduces elements of unnatural stretching as the proportions deviate from realistic human dimensions. Enlarged heads in cartoon figures often aim for a whimsical or humorous effect, rather than maintaining natural structural coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cartoonified body free of obvious artifacts and maintains a certain sense of realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body in Image B shows a smooth, streamlined cartoon style, common in caricatures or stylized representations meant to simplify features while retaining essential shapes. Although the body's realism is compromised by the cartoon style, it maintains quality without visible artifacts or issues that would detract from its intended whimsical portrayal.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the bobblehead on the bookshelf look visually plausible and structurally consistent with the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bobblehead in Image B is positioned directly in front of a bookshelf. It aligns with the bookshelf and maintains believable proportions concerning the background, suggesting that its placement is visually plausible and structurally sound within this context. There is no misalignment or disproportion that might cause the image to look inconsistent.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the face retained its accuracy with no loss of fine details or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even though the face is blurred in Image B, the focus is primarily on analyzing potential loss of detail or unnatural textures. Because the face is altered to fit the cartoon style of the image as a whole, details may be simplified, but this analysis must exclude the blurred face. Thus, focusing solely on other aspects of Image B does not show signs of lost accuracy or the introduction of bizarre textures on unblurred portions.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the combination of an accurate face and a cartoonified body achieve coherence and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the face cannot be assessed for accuracy due to blurring, the cartoonified body complements the concept of caricature, with exaggerated proportions and a stylized aesthetic. The coherence lies in how the body and head share a common theme, but natural appearance is inherently compromised by the fantasy style; thus focus remains on coherence which corresponds with a purposeful portrayal rather than authenticity.",
