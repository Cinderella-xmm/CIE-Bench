    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style warrior retain the long hair and muscled neckline with proportional scaling and without unnatural deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a chibi-style figure, which often involves disproportionate scaling to enhance cuteness and simplify elements. However, the figure maintains long hair without visible unnatural deformation common in chibi representations. The neckline is armored rather than muscled, indicating a shift in design focus from realistic muscle structure in Image A to stylized armor in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the icy armor transparent with visible internal reflections and no solid or jagged edges that suggest digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor appears icy and has a reflective sheen suggesting transparency but not absolute translucency. The edges are smooth without jagged lines or signs of digital artifacting, maintaining a coherent polished appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ice shards evenly distributed around the figure, small enough to fit the snow globe scale, and textured like real ice without repeating patterns or floating anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ice shards are distributed around the figure within the snow globe. They are scaled appropriately to fit within the environment and exhibit irregular textures reminiscent of real ice. No floating anomalies or repeating patterns are discernible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the terrain beneath the figure composed of jagged, snow-covered rocks with realistic texture and shadowing, and does the figure rest securely on it without appearing suspended?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the terrain beneath the figure as smooth snow rather than jagged rocks, consistent with the concept of a snow globe. The figure appears securely nestled within this snow-covered surface as expected.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the wooden base have consistent wood texture, visible grain, and clearly defined runes that do not appear pixelated or digitally overlaid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base showcases a consistent texture with visible wood grain, suggesting realistic material. The runes are clearly defined and do not suffer from pixelation or digital overlay issues.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the snow globe's surface smooth and transparent, with no visible seams or distortions that affect the internal elements' appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the snow globe in Image B appears smooth and transparent, with no visible seams or distortions that compromise the appearance of the internal elements. This transparency allows for clear visibility of the chibi-style figure and surrounding shards.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the chibi version of the figure’s face preserve the original’s blue eyes, white hair, and facial structure in a simplified but identifiable manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the face is blurred, the visible features include consistent white hair and a simplified version of the original facial structure typical of chibi representations. The elements are identifiable despite simplification, maintaining the chibi aesthetic.",
