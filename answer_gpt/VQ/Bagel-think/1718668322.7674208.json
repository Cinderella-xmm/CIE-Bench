      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the shoulder and chest armor sections display realistic metallic sheen with proper light reflection and depth, avoiding flat or overly shiny surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor sections have a shiny metallic appearance that captures light and reflects it realistically. This gives the material depth and dimension, contributing to a more natural metallic sheen rather than a flat or overly shiny surface. The understanding of how metal reflects light helps in determining the realism of the material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the joint areas of the armor aligned with the underlying anatomy and free from geometric distortions or unnatural gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B, the armor's joints are fitted and aligned to the character's anatomy without noticeable distortions or gaps. The armor seems to follow the natural curves and lines of the body closely, which is essential for preserving the realism and integrity of the design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the metallic hair strands appear as continuous, flowing wires with consistent color gradients and reflective properties, without breaking or clumping unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair strands exhibit a metallic look with consistency in color gradients and reflective properties. There are no visible breaks or clumps; this continuity and the flowing appearance are significant for resembling realistic flowing wires or strands of hair with metallic characteristics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform, neutral gray tone with no visible remnants of the original setting or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the background is a consistent gray tone without any remnants or elements from another setting, and the lighting throughout is uniform. The use of a neutral background aids in emphasizing the main subject without distractions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all edited regions—armor, hair, and background—seamlessly integrated with smooth transitions and no visible artifacts like pixelation or mismatched edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited regions in Image B, including the armor, hair, and background, show seamless integration with smooth transitions. There are no visible signs of pixelation or mismatched edges. This indicates a high-quality edit where various elements are harmonized to form a cohesive image.",
