      "question": "Do the wings of the butterfly retain their natural texture and pattern without any visible unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is represented in a pixelated, blocky 3D style that does not aim to preserve the natural texture and pattern of a real butterfly. The representation uses simplified blocks to create the form, resulting in visible unnatural artifacts such as pixelation. Without referencing Image A, common sense suggests that this representation loses the natural texture seen in real butterflies.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the butterfly's body and wings consistent with its natural form, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a pixelated, 3D representation of a butterfly which inherently alters the proportions and shapes due to its stylized and abstract form. The use of square blocks creates a form that does not adhere to natural shapes and proportions. Comparing this to Image A reveals that Image A displays a natural butterfly shape and proportions that are not present in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the lighting and shading on the butterfly in the 3D model appear natural and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pixelated, 3D style of Image B inherently lacks detailed lighting and shading, offering instead flat and uniform color blocks which do not reflect natural light consistency. Image A shows subtle shading and lighting that gives the butterfly form and depth. Thus, the lighting and shading in Image B do not appear natural or consistent with the realistic shading seen in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details, such as the patterns on the wings and the texture of the body, been preserved without any loss or distortion in the 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B simplifies details and textures into a blocky, pixelated form, representing them abstractly rather than preserving the intricate textures and patterns present in real butterfly wings. Image A shows delicate patterns and textures which are lost in the stylized representation of Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and placement of the butterfly in the 3D model appear visually plausible and coherent within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is positioned flat against a plain background, with no clear interaction or coherence with a scene or environment like Image A shows on a wooden surface. The composition is simplistic due to the style, but the butterfly's placement in the edited image doesn't appear visually integrated into a surrounding scene.",
