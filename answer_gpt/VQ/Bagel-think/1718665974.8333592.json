    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the brass gears and leather armor pieces on the character’s torso and limbs have consistent shapes, realistic metallic textures, and proper alignment without visible gaps or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a character adorned in brass and leather armor with intricate gear work. The shapes of the gears and armor pieces appear consistent and symmetrical. The brass components exhibit a realistic metallic texture, typical of well-rendered steampunk aesthetics, and there are no visible gaps or misaligned edges, indicating a careful design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the clockwork wings symmetrically positioned and structurally coherent, with visible mechanical joints and gear patterns that follow logical engineering principles and do not exhibit warped or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings on the character are fashioned after clockwork mechanisms, featuring symmetrical positioning and detailed gear patterns. These gears and joints follow consistent mechanical logic, with no visible warping or breakage, demonstrating a solid understanding of coherent structural design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the clock face integrated into the glowing orb clearly visible, properly scaled, and emitting light consistently with the surrounding glow, without distorting the shape or texture of the orb or tendrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In this image, the clock face is prominently integrated into the center of the character's chest, surrounded by a glowing orb. The scale is appropriate and complements the glowing design without distortion in the shape or texture. The light emission seems consistent with the orb's glow, providing a harmonious visual.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background cityscape feature detailed brass towers and airships arranged in a spatially plausible layout, with consistent lighting and shadowing under a sepia tone, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background presents a steampunk cityscape with brass towers and balloons as airships. Everything is arranged spatially plausibly with correct perspective and scale. The consistent sepia tone and shadowing provide a realistic atmosphere without anomalies of floating or disconnection.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sepia tone applied consistently across the entire image, maintaining visible details in the character’s clothing, mechanical elements, and background without causing fading, discoloration, or loss of contrast in critical areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire image is covered with a uniform sepia tone that ensures all aspects, including clothing details, mechanical elements, and the background, are visually coherent. Details remain clear without fading or loss of contrast, suggesting a solid understanding of applying sepia toning effectively.",
