      "question": "Do the facial features and accessories of the individuals appear detailed and clear despite the enlarged heads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the analysis of the individuals suggests that the faces are deliberately blurred, and accessories are minimal, focusing on the visual aspect of likeness to cartoon-style figures. Even though there's an enlargement effect, the absence of clear and detailed facial expressions aligns with the design of this cartoonish transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the transition between the enlarged heads and the cartoonish bodies smooth and free from noticeable artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a smooth integration between the heads and bodies as part of their conversion to cartoonish figures. The overall design of the image ensures no apparent artifacts or discontinuities are visible at the junctions, reflecting a consistent cartoon-style image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the individuals' bodies in relation to the log cabin realistic and consistent with the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individuals' bodies are transformed into cartoonish shapes, which typically entail exaggerated features for stylistic reasons and may not adhere strictly to realistic proportions. Compared to the cabin, the figures appear stylized and not realistically proportioned, indicating a deliberate stylistic choice.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the clothing and equipment retain their natural textures and details without any loss or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing and equipment are rendered in a simplified, uniform cartoon style, which eliminates realistic textures and detail. This results in a smooth, non-textured finish which is characteristic of cartoon imagery, contrasting with the detailed textures found in realistic images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the individuals' bodies and the log cabin intact and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition to a cartoon style retains the geometric shapes in terms of broad outlines and structures of both the characters and the log cabin, without visible distortion. This is seen in the outlines and spatial arrangement that keep their basic integrity despite the strong stylization.",
