    "Question": "Q1: Are the pastel-colored areas of the dancer's leotard and tights smoothly blended without visible color artifacts or unnatural transitions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is depicted as a sticker figure on a journal. The colors of the leotard and tights should appear smooth and consistent, avoiding any harsh lines or transitions that can signify poor editing. Pastel colors typically blend softly and shouldn't display artifacts such as pixelated edges or uneven coloring. Observing the dancer’s attire in the context of this illustration style, it should look naturally coherent with the style of the journal design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the detachable sections around the dancer’s leg maintain consistent thickness and alignment with the leg’s natural curvature, avoiding floating or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the section around the dancer’s leg is part of the sticker design element on the journal cover. Consistent thickness and natural curvature indicate that the sticker is well-aligned and illustrates the dancer’s leg in a realistic yet stylized manner, consistent with the artistic theme. Any irregular edges might imply a misalignment or disproportionate representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the angular transformations applied to the dancer’s limbs physically plausible, with joints and limbs maintaining correct anatomical relationships and no exaggerated bends?",
    "explanation": "When examining Image B’s depiction, the dancer is illustrated as a sticker figure which should symbolize the human form with plausible anatomical relationships. This means the arms, legs, and joints must appear in a position that is theoretically possible, avoiding anatomically impossible bends or exaggerations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the edges of the dancer’s sticker figures cleanly integrated onto the journal surface, with shadows and lighting matching the surrounding environment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is represented as a sticker on a journal cover. The integration should appear seamless such that the edges of the sticker do not stand out inappropriately from the journal. The lighting and shadow should reflect the same conditions as the rest of the elements on the surface to ensure a realistic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the dancer’s hands retain five fingers each, with natural spacing and proportions, and no fused or extra digits?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, as a stylized sticker, the dancer's hand should still reflect the typical human anatomy, retaining five fingers on each hand. The depiction should show naturally spaced fingers without any merging or unnecessary additional digits to maintain anatomical accuracy even in stylized forms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
