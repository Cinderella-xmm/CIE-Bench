    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the energy crown at the top of the Eiffel Tower symmetrically aligned with the tower’s central axis and does it cast consistent light without visible rendering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The energy crown is positioned at the top of the structure in Image B, and its alignment with the tower’s central axis can be assessed by observing its symmetrical placement above the central part. The light emitted by the crown should be consistent and uniform without any rendering artifacts for proper integration with the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the iron lattice girders of the Eiffel Tower preserved in their original geometric configuration, with no signs of bending, stretching, or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis involves looking at the iron lattice girders’ configuration and noting if they maintain their structural integrity, characteristic shape, and connections as they do in consistent geometric patterns. Comparing both images reveals that the girders in Image B have been modified or replaced with digital elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the luminescent circuits run continuously along the tower’s surface without floating above it, and do they emit light that blends naturally with the surrounding illumination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminescent circuits should be tightly integrated into the surface, following the tower’s contours. The emission of light should blend harmoniously with the environmental lighting, suggesting seamless integration rather than appearing detached.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the digital glyphs embedded into the girders without causing visible displacement or deformation of the metal structure beneath them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Digital glyphs should be seamlessly integrated into the structure without causing any warp or distortion of the tower’s underlying metal framework. In Image B, these elements appear imposed onto the tower’s surface, altering its original design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the holographic elements appear translucent and layered with depth, and do they avoid intersecting solid parts of the tower or showing pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Holographic elements should exhibit transparency and depth, offering dimensionality. They need to be applied in a manner that avoids interfering with solid elements of the structure and should lack pixelation signs. The review of such integration in Image B shows overlapping with the tower’s form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the pixelated energy barriers positioned directly around the base of the tower and do they have sharp, consistent edges without blurring or floating above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Pixelated barriers should be accurately positioned at the base, displaying a well-defined outline without artifacts like blurring or elevation above the ground. Analysis of Image B indicates floating elements not aligned with the ground.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the digital eyes located in a position consistent with the tower’s architecture and do they emit light that casts soft shadows and reflects off adjacent surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Digital eyes and their location should align with the design layout of the tower without disrupting its architectural harmony. Light emission from these elements should interact with the structure and surroundings to cast shadows or create reflections, which is not observed in Image B.",
