      "question": "Are the added gears and copper accents seamlessly integrated into the silver surface of the teapot without visible texture inconsistencies or material discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot features added gears and copper accents that appear to seamlessly integrate with the silver surface. The consistency of the texture and lack of visible discontinuities make it look like a harmonious design. The gears and copper elements blend naturally into the ornamented surface, indicating skilled craftsmanship. This analysis employs visual assessment of material continuity and aesthetic blending, which supports the conclusion that they are well-integrated.",

      "question": "Does the curved glass dome appear transparent and smoothly contoured without geometric distortions or artificial edges that break the illusion of a real glass enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The curved glass dome in Image B seems transparent and smoothly contoured, maintaining an illusion of a real glass enclosure. Its even contour and clear surface without distortions or artificial edges enhance the realistic effect. The visual analysis focuses on the clarity and curvature consistency, which effectively portrays the realistic glass dome.",

      "question": "Are the wooden floorboards and scattered tea leaves rendered with realistic textures and proportions, and do the tiny silver utensils appear appropriately scaled and detailed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden floorboards have a realistic grain texture, and the scattered tea leaves also show accurate texture and scale. The tiny silver utensils are carefully detailed and proportioned, contributing to an overall realistic representation. The assessment hinges on textural detailing and proportional accuracy, which successfully convey real-world textures.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the moss accents naturally distributed along the base edge, with soft, organic texture and no signs of unnatural clustering or color mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moss accents in Image B are evenly distributed around the base edge with a soft, organic texture, enhancing realism. There is no visible clustering, and the color matches the surrounding scenery. This evaluation is based on visual cues of natural distribution and texture, supporting the conclusion of realistic moss representation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the steam effect emerging from the elephant's trunk appear as a smooth, translucent vapor with natural diffusion and no jagged edges or artificial glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam effect in Image B is depicted as smooth, translucent vapor emerging naturally from the elephant's trunk. The diffusion is gradual, without jagged edges or artificial glow, enhancing the realism of the steam. The analysis involved inspecting the vapor for consistent flow and translucency, concluding a realistic steam depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the vine-like metalwork elements consistently shaped and positioned around the dome, following natural curvatures without intersecting the glass unnaturally or creating inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vine-like metalwork elements in Image B are shaped consistently and positioned naturally around the dome. They follow the curvature without intersecting the glass unnaturally or casting inconsistent shadows, which contributes to a cohesive design. This assessment focuses on consistency of shape and placement, concluding realistic integration of the metalwork.",
