    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the orange, black, and silver sections of the truck's body composed of clearly defined LEGO brick patterns with uniform size and alignment, avoiding blurred or inconsistent textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is composed entirely of LEGO bricks, which are characterized by their distinct and uniform patterns due to their construction from interlocking pieces. The visual cues indicate the use of LEGO bricks with clear alignment and consistency in texture and size across the truck's body. The colors are vibrant and uniform, representing a typical LEGO brick construction, which contrasts with blurred or inconsistent textures commonly seen in non-LEGO-made objects.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wheels consist of circular gray LEGO-style pieces with correct proportions and no deformation, maintaining a solid geometric structure without jagged edges or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels are made of circular LEGO pieces, displaying the characteristic smoothness and uniformity of LEGO construction. The wheels are clearly defined with proper circular geometry and lack any jagged edges or distortions, which are traits of improperly constructed or non-standard models. This precision is indicative of typical LEGO construction standards.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth, flat black LEGO tiles arranged in a regular grid pattern without gaps, overlaps, or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck bed is made of black LEGO tiles, which are known for their smooth and flat surfaces when correctly assembled. The image shows a grid pattern that is typical of LEGO setups, with no visible gaps, overlaps, or misaligned edges, indicating a precise and intentional assembly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO truck positioned securely on a flat white shelf with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does the shelf extend appropriately beneath the full width of the truck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the LEGO truck resting on a white shelf, with no visible gaps or floating effects, suggesting it is securely placed. The shelf extends beneath the entire width of the truck, providing ample support without overhangs that could suggest instability, thus appearing as a solid, supportive surface.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all major structural components such as the tailgate, side steps, and bumpers correctly reconstructed in LEGO form with accurate proportions and proper alignment to the rest of the truck body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model of the truck includes features like the tailgate, side steps, and bumpers, all constructed with LEGO bricks. These components appear to be proportionate and properly aligned with the overall structure of the truck, which is typical when LEGO models are designed to mimic real vehicles closely.",
