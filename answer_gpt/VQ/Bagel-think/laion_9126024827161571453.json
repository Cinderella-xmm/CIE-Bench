      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the robot figures derived from the batteries have limbs and heads that are proportionally sized and attached in a way that maintains structural coherence with their original cylindrical form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual representation of batteries is stylized with a theme of science fiction, suggesting futuristic elements. However, there are no robot figures with limbs and heads derived from the batteries visible in the image. The batteries remain in their cylindrical forms without anthropomorphic features. Therefore, since there are no robotic figures with limbs and heads shown, it's concluded that the image does not maintain any such structural coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the robot figures made from the batteries rendered with a consistent metallic texture that mimics copper and black materials without visible artifacts like checkerboard patterns or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the batteries are displayed prominently, and while there are metallic colors of copper and black, these are rendered with an artistic stylization rather than a realistic texture. The image style aims for a futuristic and digital appearance, but the surfaces show inconsistent artistic textures and renderings typical in digital art rather than realistic metallic textures. Therefore, unnatural artistry is present which does lead to deviating textures from realistic metal consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the digital cityscape background positioned behind the robot figures with correct layering, atmospheric gradient, and light source alignment that matches the direction of illumination on the robots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a digital cityscape background depicted behind the batteries. However, the image does not depict actual robot figures, so comparing the lighting and alignment based on non-existent robots is not applicable. The cityscape and batteries do show stylized lighting, but the question is irrelevant to the image content as there are no robot figures to relate this to.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the digital screen displaying “10 Years in Storage” seamlessly integrated into the scene with readable text, smooth edges, and ambient lighting that matches the sci-fi theme without pixelation or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B appears with an altered phrase '10 17EO RFANES!' which suggests distortion and altered contexts from the original. This indicates the text is not seamlessly integrated for clear readability. The display does not have smooth edges and appears stylistically distorted and inconsistent with the input question's criteria.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title \"Duracell Guardians: Power Preserve Adventures!\" displayed in a clean, bold, futuristic font with uniform stroke width and no visual artifacts like jagged edges or overlapping glyphs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title in Image B is displayed as 'DURACELL YERRS'. It captures a futuristic style, consistent with the sci-fi theme with bold text, yet it does not match precisely with 'Duracell Guardians: Power Preserve Adventures!' as proposed. The lettering appears artistic rather than cleanly presented and has potential visual artifacts due to the deviation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the robot figures, title, and digital screen arranged in a way that avoids overlapping text or important visual elements, ensuring all components are legible and distinct?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there are no robot figures present in Image B, any assessment of their arrangement in conjunction with the title and digital screen is not applicable. The elements that are present have a sci-fi arrangement with the batteries and altered text front-facing and distinct in their artistic presentation, but this does not align with the presence of robot figures or the clarity aimed at discernment.",
