    "Question": "Q1: Does the scaled-down Statue of Liberty retain correct proportions between its head, torso, arms, and legs without any visible stretching or compression?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue within the glass lantern appears to maintain accurate proportions consistent with the iconic design of the Statue of Liberty. It shows the head, torso, arms, and legs in the expected proportions, despite being a miniature version for display purposes. These proportions are known from the original statue's design, which is universally recognized.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the green and copper hues on the statue’s surface distributed naturally with variations in tone and texture resembling real patina formation?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the Statue of Liberty with smooth, consistent green coloring. While it looks aesthetically pleasing and matches the typical color of the statue, it does not fully capture the varied patina that occurs on copper surfaces, where different tones and textures are present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the glass lantern transparent with visible reflections and refractions, and do its edges appear smooth without jagged lines or digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lantern is shown as transparent, demonstrating visible reflections and refractions as expected in a glass object. The edges appear smooth, and there are no visible jagged lines or artifacts that would suggest poor rendering or digital anomalies, indicating a high degree of realistic representation of glass material.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the pastel skyline composed of smooth color gradients and softly defined building silhouettes without abrupt color changes or banding?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a skyline with smooth gradients and softly defined silhouettes of buildings. The transition between colors is gradual and there are no abrupt changes or banding effects, suggesting a harmonious and cohesive design typical of pastel artwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the ships and waves beneath the statue appropriately sized relative to the statue and do they exhibit natural shapes and wave patterns without repetition or distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ships and waves are scaled to fit the smaller setting within the lantern. They are visually coherent and appropriately sized relative to the statue. The shapes of the ships and wave patterns look natural without noticeable repetition or distortion, suggesting a realistic miniature depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the revolving mechanism at the base integrated seamlessly with the lantern’s structure, with all components properly aligned and grounded without floating or misaligned parts?",
    "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a seamless integration of the revolving mechanism with the lantern structure. Components appear properly aligned and grounded, contributing to a cohesive design with no elements floating or misaligned.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do all elements in the scene—including the statue, glass lantern, ships, and waves—cast shadows consistent with a single light source and show uniform lighting without conflicting highlights or dark spots?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, it appears that the elements within the scene, including the lantern, statue, ships, and waves, are illuminated uniformly by light. However, due to the nature of the glass and the complexity of the scene, it may not conclusively demonstrate consistent shadow casting from a single light source, leading to potential discrepancies in highlights and dark areas.",
    "answer": "No"
