    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the silver-gray fabric on the blade retain the original blade's curved shape and pattern details without distortion or loss of fine lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade appears to be rendered with a pattern similar to that of Image A, but the fabric texture and slight shifts in the pattern indicate possible loss of fine detail and slight distortion in the curvature. The visual cues suggest that the fabric's textural interference might obscure some original intricacies, observable around the edge designs. Combining this observation with knowledge about textile renderings, the curved shape seems retained but not the nuanced details.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the edges of the hilt smoothly rounded and consistent in curvature, without abrupt flattening or irregular bulges suggesting poor volume shaping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a hilt covered in a gray fabric, which has evident sewing patterns and seems to lack the consistent smoothness of the original ivory hilt in Image A. The fabric introduces irregular bulges and an inconsistent texture, apparent when comparing the two, hinting at poor shaping along the volume.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the blade’s tip preserved as a pointed, slightly curved end without drooping or flattening due to over-stuffing or under-support?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade’s tip maintains a pointed appearance similar to Image A, showing no signs of drooping or flattening. Despite the fabric overlay, the tip's structure supports its curved and taut shape, indicating adequate structural support.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the black embroidered patterns uniformly spaced and aligned along the blade’s length, matching the original engraving’s density and symmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replicates the original blade's pattern from Image A, yet upon closer inspection, the alignment and spacing between individual embroidered motifs show some mild inconsistency compared to the original engravings. While general density remains similar, the fabric overlay and digital alteration slightly disturb perfect symmetry.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a consistent, flat solid color without visible gradients, shadows, or texture that could imply improper rendering or compositing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background with subtle variations and shades, indicating the presence of shadows and faint textures. These variations suggest that the background isn’t a perfectly flat, solid color, demonstrating some complexity or shadows from the item or fabric interference.",
