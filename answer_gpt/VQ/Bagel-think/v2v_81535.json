      "question": "Do the blue dragons' scales seamlessly integrate with the bowl's blue floral design without appearing as unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cilantro has been transformed into a vibrant blue, resembling dragon scales. Upon analyzing the bowl's existing floral design, which is blue, the scales do not blend seamlessly but contrast sharply with the original patterns. The distinct color and texture mismatch highlight the edited element as artificial and not naturally integrated with the bowl's design.",

      "question": "Are the wisps of orange smoke naturally integrated into the scene, complementing the curry without looking out of place or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible transformation depicting orange smoke wisps emanating from the curry. The curry retains its original texture and appearance without any added smoke effects. Therefore, any notion of orange smoke is absent ensuring that nothing appears distorted or out of place within the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the dragon eggs retain the shape and texture of the original chicken pieces, ensuring they look like solidified curry without losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, involves manipulation mainly of cilantro turned into blue dragon-like elements. The chicken pieces retain their original shape and texture as observed in Image A, with no changes made to their appearance or fine details. This preservation indicates they have not been transformed into dragon eggs in terms of structure.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the blue dragons positioned naturally above the dragon eggs, maintaining a playful yet coherent interaction without breaking the scene's structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows that the blue dragon-like elements are positioned over the curry, which remains unchanged as chicken pieces. The blue cilantro visually seems somewhat detached and appears more superimposed than integrated. The arrangement does not maintain coherence or a playful interaction with the curry due to its artificial look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the edited image, including the transformed cilantro, dragon eggs, and smoke, maintain a natural and authentic appearance without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cilantro has been altered to an intense blue color resembling dragon scales, visually clashing with the rest of the scene. There are no visible alterations involving dragon eggs or smoke effects. The cilantro modification appears conspicuous and creates an unnatural look which disrupts the authenticity of the overall image.",
