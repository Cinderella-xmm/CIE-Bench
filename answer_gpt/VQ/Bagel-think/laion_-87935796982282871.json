      "question": "Are the color blocks on the comforter smoothly blended and textured to resemble natural fur, with no visible stitching artifacts or abrupt edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The comforter in Image B features a design that mimics tree bark and leaves rather than smooth natural fur. The texture appears more like layered leaves and bark rather than a seamless fur pattern. The abrupt change in texture from leafy areas to wood sections suggests a deliberate artistic design rather than a smooth blending. This indicates the absence of a fur-like, smoothly textured surface.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ear-shaped pillows have a natural, upright shape with soft leaf trims that appear securely and organically attached without floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ear-shaped pillows are red with a distinct pattern, resembling upright whimsical ears. The visual effect suggests they are not natural as they do not incorporate typical pillow softness and structure. The leaf trims around the ears do not appear securely attached, as they have abrupt edges and do not integrate seamlessly with the main pillow. This suggests the design intention rather than natural, secure integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the branch-like legs thin, curved, and textured like natural wood, and do they connect correctly to the bed base without appearing broken or disconnected?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited bed legs in Image B aim to represent tree branches with a look inspired by nature. However, they do not exhibit a thin, curved structure typical of slender branches. Instead, they are depicted with a broader, more exaggerated appearance that does not precisely mimic natural wood. Furthermore, the integration with the bed base seems more artistic than physically realistic, which implies a deliberate design choice to disengage from a natural appearance.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the red tail extend from the comforter with a rounded, fluffy shape and soft texture, and does it not intersect or clip through the fabric beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red tail is prominent with a distinct shape that suggests a fluffy texture, consistent with the intent of exaggerated design. It extends smoothly from the comforter's design, indicating a clear separation. However, it appears to be connected at a specific point and does not show any intersection or clipping with the surrounding fabric. The tail's visual properties suggest it intends to simulate a fluffy appearance without realistic texture engagement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows and lighting on the ears, tail, and branch legs consistent with the ambient light source in the room and do they align with the original bed's position and surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ambient lighting in both images is diffused and comes from the side of the bed, as indicated by the lamp. The additional elements in Image B need more consistent shadowing and light reflection matching the original setting. The shadows cast by the ears, tail, and branch-like legs in Image B do not fully correspond to the directional light that would create expected shadow patterns, with altered element perspectives lacking coordination with the room's consistent lighting conditions.",
