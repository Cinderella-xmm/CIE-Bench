    "Question": "Q1: Does the bread slice retain a natural crumb texture and crust edge without visible smoothing or unnatural distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bread slice features a cartoonish design, and the expression of texture is more stylized than realistic. The edges of the bread are more defined by lines and do not exhibit a natural crumb texture as would be expected in a realistic depiction. The colors and outlines are simplified, and there is an artistic distortion to suit the illustration style. This differs from a photographic or realistic texture, indicating a departure from naturalism.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the facial features positioned within the bread slice and aligned with its surface plane, without appearing detached or floating above it?",

    "Question": "Q3: Do the lettuce leaves forming the cape show consistent leaf texture and natural curling, without flat or uniformly colored sections suggesting loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lettuce leaves resemble a simplistic, stylized illustration rather than a detailed, textured depiction. The leaves are uniformly colored and lack significant detail in texture or natural leaf curling. The leaves have a uniform, consistent color, common in cartoon styles, which doesn't emphasize detail as a realistic image would.",
