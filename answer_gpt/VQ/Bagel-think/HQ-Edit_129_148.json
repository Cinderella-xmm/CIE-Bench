      "question": "Is the figure proportionally scaled and positioned within the globe such that her body parts (especially limbs and head) maintain natural anatomical alignment and do not appear stretched or compressed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure of the girl within the globe appears proportionally accurate. The limbs and head are naturally aligned, maintaining typical anatomical proportions expected in a model or sculpture representation. There is no apparent distortion or stretching, suggesting that the figure has been correctly scaled within the three-dimensional space of the globe.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the intricate patterns on the dress and the braided hairstyle clearly visible and free from blurring, aliasing, or loss of fine detail after conversion to a 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the dress and the braided hairstyle are visibly detailed and sharp. The design is clear, with distinct lines and colors that do not show signs of blurring or aliasing. This indicates that the conversion to a 3D model has preserved the fine details without any noticeable degradation in quality.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wall patterns inside the globe accurately reflect the colors and shapes of the dress's pattern without warping, misalignment, or color deviation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns inside the globe in Image B mirror the intricate designs on the dress. The colors and shapes appear to be accurately represented, with no visible warping or misalignment. There is consistency in the color scheme and design elements, indicating no color deviation, supporting the accuracy of the reflection.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature roots beneath the figure arranged in a way that follows natural growth patterns and does not intersect or distort the figure’s legs or skirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature roots beneath the figure are arranged naturally, following organic growth patterns similar to those seen in nature. They do not intersect or distort the figure’s legs or skirt, maintaining a harmonious integration into the scene without overlapping the figure inappropriately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the miniature animals positioned at ground level with proper shadowing and scale relative to the figure, and do they have natural textures and forms without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature animals in Image B are positioned at ground level and appear to be proportionally scaled relative to the figure. The shadows align correctly with their positions, giving a natural appearance. The textures and forms of the animals are realistic, with no visible artifacts or unnatural elements present, indicating a high level of detailing.",
