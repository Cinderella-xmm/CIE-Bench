      "question": "Do the vibrant striped and polka dot patterns on the 3D chibi-style ties appear undistorted and maintain their original integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the striped and polka dot patterns on the ties appear bold and intact, with clear delineation in color and spacing of dots. The visual inspection shows that the stripes are consistently colored, and the polka dots are evenly spaced without irregularities or distortions. Using world knowledge, one can note that consistent patterns suggest integrity. Therefore, these patterns maintain their original integrity.",

      "question": "Are the 3D chibi-style ties seamlessly integrated into the realistic drawer setting without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a drawer setting with ties that appear distinctly in a 3D chibi-style, which contrasts with the more realistic setting of a wooden drawer. The texture of the ties appears smooth and plasticky, which does not naturally integrate with the realistic wooden texture of the drawer. From world knowledge, smooth and unrealistic textures generally indicate visible artifacts or mismatches in style within different presentation dynamics.",

      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style ties retain proper proportions and physical rationality, ensuring no geometric shapes are broken or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties are presented with a cartoonish and stylized exaggerated look typical of chibi design. Despite this stylization, there's no visible distortion or breakage in the overall proportions and shapes, suggesting physical rationality is maintained. Based on world knowledge about chibi design, which often exaggerates proportions for stylistic effects, the shapes are consistent with the rules of chibi aesthetics.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style ties exhibit consistent material properties, such as texture and sheen, similar to their original appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the original image shows ties with fabric texture and fabric-type sheen. In Image B, these ties have a distinct chibi-style plastic quality without any fabric texture or sheen. From knowledge of material properties, it's evident that the 3D chibi-style appearance has changed these aspects, moving away from the original fabric-like qualities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the arrangement of the 3D chibi-style ties within the drawer setting adhere to common sense and physical logic, ensuring visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties are positioned adjacent to each other in a drawer setting, and a chibi-style representation of arms suggests ties could be held or supported from the back. While the stylization is chibi in nature, using world knowledge about drawer layouts and object placement, the placement seems rational with ties neatly adjacent, maintaining common sense and physical logic for organization within a drawer.",
