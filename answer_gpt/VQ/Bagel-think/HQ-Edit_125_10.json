      "question": "Does the sail's surface retain its original fabric texture and intricate knotwork design when converted into a game board layout, without visible pixelation, warping, or inconsistent patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sail of the Viking ship model is transformed into part of the game box design. Analyzing the fabric texture, it appears smooth and consistent, similar to the original texture in Image A, and the intricate knotwork design is well-preserved without pixelation or warping. The patterns appear evenly integrated into the box layout, suggesting high resolution and careful adaptation.",

      "question": "Are the mini figures derived from the rowers positioned correctly along the hull, maintaining proportional size and anatomical structure without distortion or missing limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents small figures resembling rowers in front of the box. These figures appear anatomically correct with no distorted or missing limbs, maintaining proportional size consistent with the miniature theme commonly found in board games. Their positioning around the box suggests deliberate placement without distortion.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box in Image B features Norse motifs similar to the intricate carvings on the Viking ship's dragon head and hull from Image A. These motifs maintain the carving style with smooth edges and consistent shading. The material appearance matches the original wood texture, indicating precision in design transfer.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text on the game box in Image B reads 'Voræs Faglîns' with clear typography. It is stylistically consistent with a historical theme, involving bold and serif fonts often associated with Northern European design. There are no signs of the text floating above or casting unrealistic shadows, which would disrupt the visual coherence.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden texture accents on the sides of the game box in Image B match the grain pattern seen on the tabletop in Image A. Both textures exhibit similar lighting conditions and consistent color tones that avoid visible tiling or mismatches, showing attention to detail in maintaining realism.",
