      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the branches of the tree composed of clean, angular geometric lines consistent with Art Deco style, without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the tree with a prominent Art Deco influence. The branches are formed using angular geometric lines characteristic of stained glass art and Art Deco design, offering an elegant and clean outline. There are no abrupt or jagged edges present in the tree structure, which aligns with the Art Deco styling principles. Thus, through careful observation combining visual cues from Image B with knowledge about Art Deco style, the conclusion can be drawn.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the grass in the foreground display muted, uniform coloration with preserved textural details such as individual blades or soft gradients, rather than appearing uniformly flat or artificially colored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the foreground grass maintains a flat appearance consistent with the stained glass design, differing from textured depictions. The grass is rendered without distinct blades or soft gradients. Instead, the use of consistent coloration and line work reflects stained glass techniques, thus appearing uniformly flat and artificial. Hence, visual assessment combined with knowledge of stained glass implies the grass does not have the described textural detailing.",

      "question": "Are the mountain silhouettes composed of defined angular planes in bronze and teal tones, maintaining layered depth and spatial consistency without overlapping or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the mountain silhouettes with angular planes typical of stained glass artistry, in bronze and teal shades. The planes are distinct, which helps maintain spatial depth and consistency; they do not overlap or appear isolated from the background. Stained glass style accentuates layered depth through such defined geometric divisions, affirming the mountain silhouettes meet the criteria.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the sky feature a smooth gradient from dark at the top to lighter near the horizon, with thin, evenly spaced accent lines that follow the curvature of the scene without intersecting or distorting the starfield?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sky designed as part of a stained glass motif. It does not possess a smooth gradient or accent lines typical of natural scenes. Instead, it relies on solid, contrasting visual divisions inherent to stained glass style, lacking fine gradient detailing or intricate accent lines. Consequently, analyzing the sky based on visual evidence and stained glass characteristics leads to the conclusion that it doesn't feature a gradient or thin accent lines as described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all elements—tree, mountains, and sky—rendered with consistent stained glass-style outlines and fills, lacking transparent patches, misaligned edges, or inconsistent shading within the same layer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consistently illustrates a stained glass aesthetic across all elements—the tree, mountains, and sky—with distinctive outlines and fills. The structural integrity typical of stained glass panels ensures no transparent patches, edge misalignments, or inconsistent shading. Through an examination highlighting the use of typical stained glass techniques, the rendering consistency across Image B's composition becomes evident.",
