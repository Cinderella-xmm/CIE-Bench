      "question": "Does the chibi version of the woman have a proportionally enlarged head relative to the body, with limbs and torso scaled down appropriately without deformed joints or elongated limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi art style is characterized by an oversized head relative to the body, which is a common depiction to create a cute and whimsical effect. This stylistic approach results in a smaller torso and limbs that appear properly scaled without visible distortion in joints or undue elongation of limbs. The body parts successfully maintain a proportion typical for chibi representations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the oversized frills on the gown rendered with curved, layered shapes that suggest fabric volume, and do they avoid flat, rigid edges or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frills on the gown in Image B exhibit a soft, curved appearance, with layers that impart a sense of fabric volume, which is essential in creating a realistic drapery effect in clothing artwork. The absence of flat, rigid lines or any visual indicator of stretched fabric supports the depiction of a textile with texture and dimension.",

      "question": "Do the gold accents on the jewelry show consistent metallic highlights and soft shadows that align with the lighting direction in the scene, without harsh glints or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold details on the jewelry feature highlights and soft shadows, which are indicative of metallic surfaces reacting to light sources. The absence of harsh glints or distracting texture artifacts suggests a competent rendering of metal that adheres to the lighting direction indicated by the sceneâ€™s composition.",

      "question": "Is the modified chair still identifiable as a chair with four legs and backrest, scaled down proportionally and colored vividly without broken geometry or missing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chair in Image B retains its recognizable features of having four legs and a backrest, scaled proportionally while also showcasing vivid colors. No geometry appears broken, nor are parts missing, which sustains the identity of the object as a proper chair.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pearl border encapsulates the image boundaries evenly, with spheres that are consistently sized and well-spaced. There is no evidence of pearls overlapping the main subject, and the edge is smooth, devoid of jagged lines that would disrupt the consistent design.",
