      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D figure maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the skateboarder's mid-action pose without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboarder's pose maintains a dynamic mid-action stance similar to that of the skateboarder in Image A. The chibi-style figure accurately reflects the proportions and physical rationality of such a pose, considering the common artistic style of chibi figures which emphasize cute and exaggerated proportions while retaining movement characteristics.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing and skateboard of the chibi figure are detailed, showing textures and material characteristics typical of such miniature figures, similar to how they appear in a real-world context. The details are well-preserved, reflecting natural textures within the snow globe setup.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B appears structurally consistent and credible, with a clear glass surface reflecting realistic light scattering effects mainly from sunlight through the window. The globe structure aligns with expectations for such an object, presenting a plausible visual scenario.",
