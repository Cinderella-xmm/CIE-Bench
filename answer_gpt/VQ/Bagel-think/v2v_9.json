      "question": "Does the creature's body maintain the structural coherence and visual plausibility of the bubble tea cup's shape and texture without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is presented in a whimsical, cartoonish style. The general form of the bubble tea cup remains recognizable, smiling, with star-like eyes, and a straw protruding from the lid. The texture of the cup, including the cup's body and the tapioca pearls, maintains a consistent and coherent appearance, avoiding unnatural distortions. The emphasis on a jovial expression is a natural enhancement, fitting the artistic style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the design elements like tapioca pearls and the straw integrated naturally into the creature's form without appearing as unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the straw and tapioca pearls are essential components of the bubble tea depiction. The straw is prominently placed within the lid, retaining a plausible attachment to the overall design. The pearls are smoothly incorporated into the base of the cup, clearly visible and properly sized to match the aesthetic cartoon style of the creature. No unnatural textures or artifacts are apparent, maintaining a coherent look.",

      "question": "Does the custom orb or capsule near the creature's feet feature patterns and colors consistent with the bubble tea theme without losing fine details or introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The custom orb and capsule near the creature's feet in Image B are designed with vibrant colors that complement the purple theme of the bubble tea creature. These elements are stylized but are consistent with the overall whimsical theme and do not introduce any unnatural textures or lose fine details that would clash with the bubble tea concept.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the creature relative to the custom orb/capsule and the overall scene logically consistent and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the bubble tea creature compared to the orb and capsule are cartoonishly exaggerated, but this is consistent with the style. The scene maintains a consistent proportionate logic where even the whimsy of the presentation aligns with a fantastical context. There are no visible distortions in proportions within this artistic style.",

      "question": "Does the presentation of the creature's name and elemental type complement the artwork's charm without disrupting the visual flow or introducing distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presentation of what appears to be the creature's name ('SFIMI') and elemental type is stylized as part of a fictional or playful interpretation of text, fitting the whimsical and charming style of the artwork. While the text is designed to appear indecipherable, it complements the artwork by maintaining thematic flair and does not disrupt the visual flow or introduce distractions.",
