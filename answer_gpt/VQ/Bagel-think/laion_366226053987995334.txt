    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) on the feather earrings proportionally sized and seamlessly integrated into the feather surface without distorting the engraved lines or creating unnatural texture contrasts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are present on the cartoon characters and not directly on the feather earrings as depicted in Image A. Therefore, no integration of facial features with feather surfaces needs assessment.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the central black oval stone on each feather preserved and unobscured by the added facial features, and do the engraved lines of the feather remain symmetrical and undistorted?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict feather earrings with central black stones, rather anthropomorphic figures holding hands with textual additions. Therefore, this characteristic preservation or obstruction is not applicable.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a visible and logically connected arm-like extension from one earring to the other, suggesting motion, and are both earrings still properly attached to their hooks without floating or detachment?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows cartoon figures holding hands, indicating an implied connection, but this is not directly related to earring hooks; motion is suggested via posture of cartoon characters. Therefore, earrings' hook attachment isn't assessed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the text bubble positioned near the head of the anthropomorphic earring, clearly legible, and free from overlapping or covering essential details of the earrings?",
    "explanation": "The text bubble in Image B is clear and placed above the cartoon figures. Despite legibility issues with extra symbols, it does not overlap figuresâ€™ essential details.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the bold outlines follow the exact contours of the earrings without gaps or misalignment, and are the vibrant colors applied consistently without pixelation, blurring, or loss of fine engraved details?",
    "explanation": "The bold outlines in Image B generally align with the cartoon character contours and colors, showing consistency. Given its caricature-style presentation, pixelation or detail loss isn't evident.",
    "answer": "Yes"
