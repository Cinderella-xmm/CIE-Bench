    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal facets on the cabin’s walls, roof, and windows evenly shaped and aligned with the original cabin’s triangular and rectangular outlines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin is transformed with crystal-like facets, primarily of triangular and polygonal shapes, which do not align precisely with the original triangular and rectangular outlines seen in the log cabin structure of Image A. The facets appear to be placed without regard for the original shape, suggesting a disrupt in alignment.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the blue and green hues on the crystal surfaces show variations in transparency and light reflection consistent with real glass or crystal, rather than uniform solid colors?",
    "explanation": "Image B gives the appearance of having varying hues and gradients of blue and green, which mimic the reflective and translucent qualities of real glass or crystal. These variations suggest a play of light and transparency typical of such materials, rather than flat, uniform colors.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the vertical support beams and horizontal railings converted into crystal forms that maintain their original spacing, height, and alignment with the cabin’s frame?",
    "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the support beams and railings are altered into crystal forms, but they do not maintain the original spacing, height, or alignment. The transformation alters their structural integrity and placement relative to the cabin’s frame, deviating from the original setup.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the white marble platform beneath the cabin flat, continuous, and free of cracks or irregularities, and does it extend evenly under the entire base of the structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the white marble platform appears flat and continuous without visible cracks or irregularities. It extends uniformly under the base of the cabin structure, suggesting a solid and consistent foundation for the crystal cabin.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the small crystal formations along the base of the cabin proportionally smaller than the main structure, grouped in clusters, and positioned in a way that suggests natural growth rather than random placement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no distinctly small crystal formations along the base of the cabin that fit the description of being clustered or positioned as if they suggest natural growth. The cabin itself is the primary focus, and the surrounding features lack smaller, naturally arranged crystals.",
    "answer": "No"
