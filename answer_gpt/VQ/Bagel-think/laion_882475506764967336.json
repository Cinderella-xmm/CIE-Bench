      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the table and chairs composed of uniformly sized brown and amber LEGO bricks with clean, interlocking edges and no visible breaks or misalignments in their surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the furniture appears to be constructed from uniformly sized LEGO bricks. LEGO bricks are known for their clean, interlocking edges due to their precise manufacturing tolerances. This characteristic ensures there are no visible breaks or misalignments in their surfaces, contributing to a cohesive appearance. The furniture in Image B reflects these qualities, showing no breaks or misalignments. Given this observation along with the knowledge of LEGO construction, the furniture does indeed consist of uniformly sized bricks with the expected clean edges.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the tabletop and chair seats display a consistent LEGO brick texture with repeating stud patterns and no unnatural stretching or distortion of individual bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop and chair seats exhibit the texture typical of LEGO constructions, with repeating stud patterns visible across their surfaces. LEGO bricks are designed to fit together seamlessly without unnatural stretching or distortion, enabling consistent textural patterns. The furniture surfaces in Image B maintain the expected LEGO texture, showing regularity in the stud patterns without visible distortion. Thus, the tabletop and chair seats display a consistent texture with repeating studs, aligning with how LEGO bricks are typically structured.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the central element on the table a LEGO-style plant made of green bricks with recognizable leaf shapes, and is it positioned centrally without overlapping or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a central element on the table that resembles a LEGO-style plant made of green bricks. LEGO elements are designed to be recognizable in their shapes and assemble securely on flat surfaces. The central element in Image B mirrors the characteristics of a LEGO plant, with defined shapes that suggest leaf-like structures, positioned centrally without overlapping the surrounding furniture, nor floating. This observation is consistent with how LEGO constructions are usually depicted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the furniture placed on a flat, gray LEGO baseplate that fits snugly beneath the table and chairs, with no overhang beyond the furniture edges and no visible seam between the baseplate and the real ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the furniture set upon a gray baseplate that aims to resemble a LEGO construction surface. LEGO baseplates are typically flat and designed to fit snugly beneath structures placed on them. However, in Image B, the baseplate does not cover the entire area beneath the furniture, showing overhang beyond the furniture edges, and the ground surrounding the table and chairs does not appear to seamlessly integrate with the baseplate. This discrepancy suggests an imperfect fit and visible bound between the baseplate and the actual ground.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged edges, pixelation, or unnatural lighting shadows around the LEGO furniture that suggest incomplete rendering or poor integration with the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals certain characteristics suggesting possible rendering artifacts. The LEGO furniture is integrated with the background, but the brightness and contrast variances around it suggest potential integration issues. These variances could lead to jagged edges, pixelation, or shadows that appear unnatural compared to typical LEGO presentations. Such traits may imply incomplete rendering or less effective integration with the background environment seen in the image.",
