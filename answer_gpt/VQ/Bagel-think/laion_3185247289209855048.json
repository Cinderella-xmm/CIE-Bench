      "question": "Does the gold wavy hair enamel pin on the head have smooth, continuous curves without jagged edges or distorted proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold wavy hair is depicted with smooth, consistent lines typical of enamel pins, which usually have clear and well-defined boundaries. The pin does not show any jagged edges or distorted shapes, suggesting quality craftsmanship. The curves are continuous and represent a stylized rendering of hair, reflecting the common design principles in enamel pins.",

      "question": "Is the pink fur-textured enamel pin on the shoulder rendered with a consistent glossy finish and no visible fibrous or organic texture that contradicts its intended material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pink fur-textured enamel pin in Image B appears uniform in finish, characteristic of enamel pins, which are usually smooth and polished. The absence of fibrous or organic textures indicates it is not trying to replicate real fur, matching the common smooth and glossy appearance of enamel representations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lines of the minimalist outline enamel pin complete, evenly spaced, and free from broken segments or irregular curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inspecting the minimalist outline of the enamel pin in Image B, the lines are consistent in width and curvature, displaying a typical enamel pin's precision. There are no interruptions or irregularities in the line work, indicating a clean design often seen in high-quality pins.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all three enamel pins exhibit consistent glossiness and color intensity without visible noise, halos, or uneven shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows all three enamel pins with even glossiness and a uniform color palette, typical of enamel pins that are polished and display vibrant, flat tones. The frame lacks visual disturbances such as noise or halos, and the shading is consistent without uneven patches.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the three enamel pins positioned such that they appear to rest on the subjectâ€™s head and shoulder without intersecting through skin or appearing detached from the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the enamel pins in Image B is such that they visually align with the contours of the head and shoulder, giving a sense of attachment expected in pin design. They do not intersect the face or body in any unnatural way, maintaining the illusion of resting on the surface as intended.",
