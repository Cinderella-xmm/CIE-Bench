      "question": "Does the leaf crown on the fox’s head have natural leaf shapes, consistent texture, and proper alignment with the head without visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf crown on the fox's head is depicted as stylized green shapes resembling leaves. These shapes are simplified and cartoon-like, consistent with the overall art style of the image. The alignment appears appropriate for the character’s head, following the aesthetic approach typical of animated illustrations. Given the stylized nature, there are no visible seams or unnatural edges that disrupt the design. This aligns with world knowledge that animated characters often have features adapted in this manner for stylistic purposes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fox’s hind legs properly aligned and proportioned when standing upright, with no distorted joints, unnatural curvature, or missing limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fox's hind legs are depicted in a cartoonish style with an upright stance. While the legs are proportionately smaller than realistic anatomy, consistent with the character design, they do not display distorted joints or unnatural curvature. Both legs are visible, maintaining typified proportions for animated fox characters. Such deviations are typical and intentional in cartoon illustrations, aligning with world knowledge of animal character designs in animation.",

      "question": "Do the tree outlines in the background maintain clean, continuous lines without jagged edges, overlapping inconsistencies, or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree outlines in the background are presented as simplistic, stylized lines typical of cartoon art. These lines are clean and continuous, fitting the art style. There are no noticeable jagged edges, overlapping inconsistencies, or missing segments, aligning with the intended aesthetic that focuses on minimalism for character emphasis.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pastel colors applied uniformly across the forest floor and foliage without creating unnatural color bleeding, pixelation, or loss of fine details like moss texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the forest floor and foliage using flat pastel colors consistent with cartoon art style, emphasizing simplicity and bold color blocks. While detailed textures like moss are absent due to the art style, they are replaced by uniform color application without visible color bleeding or pixelation. This uniformity reflects world knowledge of how animated scenes simplify complex textures for artistic expression, prioritizing bold and clear visual presentation over intricate detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the speech bubble positioned at a plausible distance from the fox, with correct shadowing and edge blending that matches the lighting and depth of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubble is positioned near the fox's head, typical for cartoon dialogues, but does not incorporate shadowing or edge blending typical of realistic lighting effects. In simple animated scenes like this, speech bubbles are often rendered without atmospheric integration as a stylistic choice, focusing on text readability and instant messaging clarity rather than depth realism.",
