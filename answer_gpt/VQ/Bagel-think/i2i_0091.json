      "question": "Does the integration of the castle hall elements into the room visually align with the existing lighting and shadows, avoiding unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows cast by the stone materials of the castle hall appear to be consistent with a real-world environment where sunlight hits from an angle, creating natural shadows and highlights. This aligns with the direction of light observed on the wooden door, suggesting an integrated setup without visible artifacts. Thus, the lighting seems continuous and cohesive, similar to what could be expected to happen indoors with natural lighting sources.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the materials of the newly added castle hall elements, like stone and metal, depicted naturally and free from obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone arch and wall provide a robust visual texture that reflects realistic stonework typically found in castle architecture. The metal elements on the door, such as hinges and handles, also appear well-integrated, with appropriate shading and detail that reflect light naturally. There are no obvious signs of digital artifacts, indicating a well-rendered scene.",

      "question": "Have the books, vases, and plants remained undistorted and preserved their original details post-editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image A contained these objects and they are absent in Image B, there is no distortion or loss of details in the edited image because the focus has shifted entirely to the castle hall scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the introduction of the castle hall maintain the room's spatial rationality, keeping the proportions and placements of objects consistent with expectations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the stone archway and wooden door, replacing the modern room elements seen in Image A. The proportions and placements in Image B suit an architectural setting typical of castle halls, with everything proportionately matching realistic expectations as they fill the scene appropriately without conflict or compression of space.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting effects in the edited castle hall scene match the light source and style of the original room, ensuring continuity in illumination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting effects are consistent with what may have been expected in a castle hall setting, with sunlight entering from above and casting shadows and bright spots naturally. This matches with Image Aâ€™s light hitting objects from the window and aligning with the texture and material reflection in Image B, ensuring continuity and coherence in illumination.",
