      "question": "Do the quilts' patterns maintain their structural consistency and detailed appearance without unnatural texture disruption after conversion to a watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilts are transformed into a watercolor style, which by nature simplifies and smooths textures and patterns. Despite this artistic transformation, the overall structure of the quilt pattern remains recognizable. However, the definition of the patterns and details are softer and less precise, which is typical of watercolor art. This inherent change leads to some texture disruption, as watercolor generally lacks the texture detail found in the original fabric material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the colors of the bedding and surrounding elements been naturally blended into the watercolor style without appearing unnaturally muted or overly vivid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors across the bedding and other elements are vibrant but not excessively so. Watercolor styles often emphasize blending and fluidity of colors, and here the hues are vivid but meld well into the watercolor theme, avoiding harsh contrasts or unnatural appearances. The colors maintain a harmonious and appealing blending typical of watercolor painting, without excessive vividness or unnatural muting.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the nightstand, picture frames, and flowers retain their natural shapes and material textures without distortion or unnatural artifacts in the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nightstand, picture frames, and flowers are depicted in a watercolor style, which inherently alters their texture and material appearance. The objects retain their general shape, but the transformation to watercolor inevitably introduces a level of form simplification and blending typical of this artistic style. The watercolor effect causes some smoothing and fluidity in the representation of texture and sharpness, but there is no excessive distortion or unnatural artifacts beyond what is typical for this style.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the relative positions and proportions of the beds, nightstand, and wall pictures consistent and visually plausible in the watercolor illustration style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positions and proportions of the beds, nightstand, and wall pictures appear consistent with what is found in Image A. Despite the transition to watercolor, there is no evident distortion of scale or relative positioning between these objects. They are depicted in a visually plausible manner consistent with the original, respecting logical spatial relationships typical in such room settings.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the quilt's intricate patchwork design stay recognizable and free from distortion or unnatural simplification in the watercolor illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the quilt's patchwork design is translated into a watercolor style—which naturally simplifies and blurs hard lines—the overall pattern and configuration are still recognizable. However, the innate characteristics of watercolor mean some level of detail and texture is lost or simplified. Thus, while the pattern remains coherent, it does undergo some level of simplification and softening, which may lead to perceivable distortion in structural detail.",
