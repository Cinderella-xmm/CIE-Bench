      "question": "Do the iridescent scales cover the cardinal’s body smoothly without visible seams, pixelation, or inconsistent color gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal has been transformed into a fiery bird with iridescent scales that appear smooth with consistent color gradients and no visible pixelation or seams. The colors transition naturally along the body, evoking the appearance of flames. This assessment is based on the visual cues of even coloring and smooth transitions across the body's surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the flames emerging from the wingtips and tail oriented upward and shaped naturally, without abrupt edges or disconnected fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flames at the wingtips and tail are oriented upwards, conforming to a natural flow consistent with typical depictions of fire. Their movement appears fluid, and there are no abrupt edges or fragments that disrupt the continuity of the flames. This is concluded from observing the smooth and cohesive appearance of these flame elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glowing ember effect confined to the eye area, with no halo bleed onto the surrounding feathers or face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing effect in Image B is particularly prominent in the eye area of the fiery bird. The intensity of the glow is focused on the eye itself, with a distinct boundary that prevents any halo from bleeding onto the adjacent feathers or face, maintaining a clear definition. This precise containment indicates an intentional design in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the obsidian branch retain the original branch’s branching pattern and thickness, with a smooth, glassy surface free of cracks or texture inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branch in Image B has been altered to resemble obsidian, retaining the shape and branching pattern of the original branch while appearing smooth and glossy. The consistent texture across the branch surface and absence of cracks suggest a glassy, polished look characteristic of obsidian.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the flames on the blossoms directly connected to the petals, with no detached or floating flame elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, flames envelop the blossoms and seem to be directly attached to the petal surfaces. There are no separate or floating flame elements; each flame is rooted in the petals, indicating a deliberate design to show the flames as part of the blossoms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the snowflakes falling around the flaming elements evenly distributed, with no unnatural absence or clustering near the fire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The distribution of snowflakes in Image B appears even throughout the image, including areas near the flames. Despite the presence of fire, there's no unnatural gap or excessive clustering evident around these fiery elements, suggesting attention to natural snowfall distribution.",
