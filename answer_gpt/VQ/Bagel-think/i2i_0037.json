      "question": "Does the white border framing the image maintain a clean edge along the entire perimeter without disrupting the natural appearance of the dessert inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a white border is visible around the image, similar to a Polaroid photo. This border appears consistent and clean along the perimeter, which is typical for a Polaroid style that aims to mimic an old-fashioned photograph. The dessert inside the border seems unaffected by the border itself, maintaining its natural appearance. The visual cues suggest that the border's purpose is mostly decorative, not impacting the internal elements.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the light brown vintage filter applied to the image enhance its film-style appearance without causing any parts of the banana slices or whipped cream to appear unnaturally colored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the application of a light brown vintage filter creates an aged or nostalgic effect, contributing to the film-style appearance. The filter alters the overall tone, giving the photo a warm hue typical of vintage aesthetics. While there is some color alteration due to the filter, the banana slices and whipped cream do not exhibit colors that look unnatural or unrealistic. The editing remains subtle enough to evoke a vintage look without overpowering the true colors of the dessert.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the handwritten caption \"Banana Cream Dream 2024\" at the bottom clear and legible with a natural look that complements the Polaroid-style photo without seeming out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handwritten caption appears at the bottom of Image B, in a manner consistent with Polaroid-style photographs where captions are often written directly onto the thick lower border of the photo. The text is slightly illegible, making it challenging to read clearly, and exhibits a handwritten style that complements the vintage aesthetic. However, the clarity and legibility of the caption could be improved while still fitting with the intended theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details like the texture of the whipped cream and the smooth surface of the cheesecake slice been preserved without showing any unnatural artifacts or blurring due to the editing effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the texture of the whipped cream and the smooth surface of the cheesecake remain distinguishable, despite the application of a vintage filter. The filter adds a slight blur or softness, which can be part of creating a vintage look. However, it does not significantly obscure or distort the details, suggesting that the editing effects preserved these aspects reasonably well without introducing unnatural artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the newly added Polaroid frame and caption seamlessly integrate with the original image of the cheesecake and bananas, ensuring the dessert remains the focal point and no elements look disjointed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Polaroid frame and caption integrate into the overall composition, embodying a cohesive retro style. The dessert remains the focal point as the central element, with the frame and caption designed to enhance rather than distract from it. The integration is typically successful if the added elements do not detract from the main subject's prominence. In this case, the focal point is preserved, and the frame and caption complement rather than clash, creating a seamless final presentation.",
