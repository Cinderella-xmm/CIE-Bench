      "question": "Do the transformed skis and hockey sticks maintain their original structural integrity and proportions as footwear, avoiding any unnatural distortions or breaks in geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the skis and hockey sticks are observed to be leaning against a rock in the snow, maintaining their shape as sports equipment. There is no indication that they have been transformed into footwear. Therefore, their structural integrity is intact as skis and hockey sticks, and there is no unnatural distortion of their geometry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vivid patterns and wooden textures from the original skis and hockey sticks naturally incorporated into the footwear design without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skis retain their vivid colorful patterns, and the hockey sticks maintain their wooden texture with no evidence of being transformed into footwear. Thus, there hasn't been any incorporation of these designs into a new form; they remain as they are.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transition from skis and hockey sticks to footwear appear logical and plausible, maintaining the visual credibility of both the original and new forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering Image B, there is no evident transition from skis and hockey sticks to footwear. The objects remain as they originally wereâ€”sports equipment. Thus, no transition has been attempted, and hence there is no visual credibility in such a nonexistent transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the original skis and hockey sticks been preserved in the new footwear design, avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the skis and hockey sticks are visible with all their details intact, as they have not been converted into footwear. Thus, there is no loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures in any supposed new design, as no such transformation has occurred.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the new footwear design respect the physical properties and proportions of the original skis and hockey sticks, avoiding any distortion or damage to geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skis and hockey sticks retain their original shapes and forms without any alteration into footwear. Hence, there is no discernible new design concerning these items, and their physical properties and proportions remain as initially depicted without distortion or geometric alteration.",
