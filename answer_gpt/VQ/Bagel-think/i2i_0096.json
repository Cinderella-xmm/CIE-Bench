      "question": "Does the sofa maintain its structural integrity and proportions from both the front and side views, avoiding any unusual geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa, when viewed from the front, appears proportionate and symmetrical. The cushions, seat, and backrest are evenly arranged, and there are no visible distortions in the geometric design of the sofa. The angles and edges of the sofa are consistent with what is typically expected for such a piece of furniture. Without comparison to Image A, the sofa in Image B maintains its structural integrity and appears without any unusual geometric distortions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fabric textures and details of the sofa consistent and clear in both the front and side views, without any visible loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric texture of the sofa appears consistent and clear. The material displays a soft texture typical of a well-upholstered sofa. There is no indication of blurriness or unnatural patterns that would suggest a loss of detail. The visual details such as the stitching and fabric texture are consistently presented, indicating the details of the sofa fabric are maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cushions and legs of the sofa align naturally between the front and side views, maintaining visual plausibility and coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the alignment of the sofa cushions appears natural and coherent. The cushions are symmetrically placed along the sofa, and the legs of the sofa appear stable and appropriately positioned under the frame. The overall arrangement of the elements on the sofa follows the expected design layout, which aligns with the typical visual and design plausibility for such furniture. The proportions between cushions and legs remain coherent.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the light and shadow effects on the sofa and surrounding area remain consistent and natural when transitioning from the front to the side view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light source appears to be coming from the left side, casting shadows on the sofa and wall. The light and shadow effects look consistent with the direction of the light, enhancing the three-dimensionality of the objects. The shadows help in grounding the sofa to the floor naturally and add depth to the room. The lighting is consistent with the scene's overall ambient light, contributing to its realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the artwork on the wall and the wall itself retain their natural appearance and realism when viewed from both the front and side perspectives?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork on the wall is a dominant feature with swirling warm colors. It appears well-integrated into the wall and shows no signs of distortion from any angle, which is consistent with flat wall-mounted artworks. The wall itself looks smooth and properly colored, consistent with the rest of the scene's design. The appearance remains realistic and natural, contributing positively to the room's aesthetics.",
