      "question": "Do the transformed chalets maintain consistent roof slopes and chimney placements without geometric distortion or floating components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chalets are transformed with ice enhancements, yet they retain the traditional chalet structure with roof slopes and chimney placements. Upon analysis, the roof slopes appear consistent and the chimneys remain in typical positions without visible distortion or floating elements. This suggests that the transformation did not affect these aspects visually.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glowing ice surface continuous across the slope and around the chalets without jagged edges, unnatural reflections, or inconsistent brightness patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a glowing ice surface covering the slope and around the chalets. The surface has smooth transitions and consistent brightness, with no visible jagged edges or patches of inconsistent brightness. The enhancements seem well-integrated, creating an even effect without unnatural reflections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the ice-enhanced pine trees retain recognizable tree silhouettes with evenly distributed icicles and no fused or missing branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pine trees are enhanced with ice features. Despite the transformation, trees maintain their characteristic silhouettes and branch structures. The icicles are evenly distributed along the branches without indications of fused or missing parts, allowing the trees to be recognizable as pine trees visually.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the auroras positioned above the mountain range without overlapping the sun or creating unnatural light halos or disconnected streaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The auroras in Image B are depicted above the mountain range, featuring a smooth gradient and placement that seems natural. They do not overlap with the sun, avoiding any unnatural halos or disconnected light streaks. The portrayal of auroras aligns with typical atmospheric depictions, avoiding visual inconsistencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the snowflake patterns on the chalet walls uniform in scale and orientation, and do they align naturally with the building's architecture without repeating or distorting at edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Close examination of the chalet walls in Image B reveals snowflake patterns integrated consistently relative to the building's architecture. The patterns appear uniform in scale and orientation, aligning naturally with the structural layout without repeating excessively or distorting at the edges. This indicates a thoughtful integration of decorative patterns.",
