    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the armor elements on the central figure's torso and arms follow natural human body contours without causing distorted shapes or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is depicted with armor that appears artistically stylized rather than realistic. The design of the armor, including its embellishments and shapes, likely prioritizes aesthetic appeal over anatomical accuracy. This often results in altered proportions or forms that do not strictly adhere to natural human contours. Armor, when represented in a fantasy or artistic style, tends to have exaggerated features that deviate from the real body's geometry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the ocean-themed armor on the rightmost figure’s jacket smooth and continuous without visible tiling or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rightmost figure's armor features intricate designs, possibly inspired by ocean motifs. The textures appear deliberately stylized, with an emphasis on detailed patterns and ornamental elements. While these designs are visually complex and intentional, such intricate details can sometimes lead to non-uniform blending or visible tiling in digital art. In fantasy illustrations, this may be observed as part of the creative choice to make the armor appear more ornate and mythical.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the right hand of the rightmost figure have exactly five fingers with natural spacing and joint curvature, even with armor applied?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rightmost figure's hand is covered by armor, which can obscure the natural anatomy of the fingers. Artistic depictions of armored hands may not always clearly display each finger due to stylization or the addition of armor elements. Armor can enhance or alter proportions for aesthetic effect, affecting how naturally the fingers are represented in terms of spacing or curvature. In fantasy artworks, hands can be stylized, resulting in potential anatomical inaccuracies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky gradient from the horizon upward smooth and free of color banding or abrupt transitions between orange, blue, and purple hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is depicted with a dramatic and stylized gradient. While the intention is to create a smooth transition between colors, digital representations can sometimes exhibit banding, where distinct lines separate color blocks. This effect can occur due to limitations in color depth or the rendering process. In fantasy art, this may be used intentionally for dramatic effect, but typically, a smooth gradient is preferred for realism.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the typography at the bottom of the image clearly legible, properly aligned, and textured with ocean-spray effects without repeating patterns or sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typography in Image B features a stylized and possibly thematic design. Fantasy or theme-oriented texts often incorporate unique textures or effects to align with the imagery. These effects, however, can sometimes lead to readability issues or irregular patterns that might not always blend smoothly. Creative textures like ocean spray can introduce details that compete with legibility, depending on their execution and parallax with the intended visual focus.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the ocean creature motifs on the armor of the leftmost figure small, integrated, and positioned in a way that does not distort the armor’s form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leftmost figure's armor involves motifs that are likely intended to create an ocean-themed aesthetic. These decorations are meant to complement and embellish the armor, fitting seamlessly without warping the implied protective function or main form. While fantasy designs encourage creativity, placement of motifs can be strategic, allowing the primary structure of the armor to remain intact and undistorted.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the shadows of the figures fall forward onto the rocks in alignment with the sun’s position behind them, and are the silhouettes sharp and unbroken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background and overall lighting are stylized, which may not adhere strictly to natural light behavior. The depicted positioning of the figures suggests backlighting from the illustrated sun. However, artistic emphasis can result in exaggerated or softened shadows that don't align with realistic light physics, causing potential discrepancies in the direction and clarity of shadows. The stylized nature might prioritize dramatic presentation over physical accuracy.",
