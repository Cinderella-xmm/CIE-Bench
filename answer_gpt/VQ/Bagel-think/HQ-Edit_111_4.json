    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the cactus arms show smooth, continuous segmentation without abrupt breaks or distorted joints, and do the glowing orbs at their ends appear naturally attached and aligned with the limb direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms the original cactus into a fantastical structure with tentacle-like arms and glowing orbs at the ends. These edited arms lack the smooth, continuous segmentation of natural cactus arms and display abrupt changes in form as seen in fictional or alien representations. The glowing orbs, while visually striking, do not naturally align with where limbs would logically taper in a natural organism, indicating a synthetic attachment inconsistent with nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the iridescent scales evenly distributed across the cactus surface, following the original rib pattern without visible seams, repetitive textures, or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a transformation with iridescent scales and vibrant colors that neither mimic the rib pattern typical of a natural cactus nor the uniform, organic distribution. These scales appear artificial, with vivid color gradients that do not naturally occur in the real world, indicating visible seams or breaks from how a normal cactus would appear based on Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the crystal spine rise vertically from the base of the cactus with consistent facets and internal clarity, maintaining alignment with the original trunk and showing no signs of digital clipping or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal spine, which stands as a centerpiece of transformation, rises vertically but does not maintain the natural alignment with the original trunk as observed in Image A. The edited structure appears added on, lacking seamless integration as it shows attributes like edge artifacts and inconsistency in facets and internal clarity expected in a digital enhancement.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bioluminescent tendrils positioned along the cactusâ€™s surface in a coherent, organic pattern, with consistent thickness and spacing, and do they cast soft glows that match the ambient lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces the organically spaced cactus arms with bioluminescent tendrils, which follow an irregular pattern and thickness, unlike the natural segmentation in Image A. The tendrils and their emitted glows do not naturally correspond with ambient lighting seen in the landscape, suggesting an artificial look.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the base of the transformed cactus fully grounded in the sand, casting a shadow that aligns with the light source and does not show floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the transformed base appears grounded with a shadow cast on the sand that aligns well with the apparent light source. Despite the fantastical elements added, the base's connection and shadow casting seem consistent with the position and setting, suggesting correct grounding and alignment.",
