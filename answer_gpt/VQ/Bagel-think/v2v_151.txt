    "Question": "Q2: Does the whimsical park backdrop with soft pastel hues, cherry blossom trees, and rose petals appear photorealistic and integrate naturally with the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger?",
    "explanation": "The whimsical park setting in Image B features pastel colors, cherry blossom trees, and dispersed petals in harmony with the chibi tiger’s playful design. The integration of background elements with the main subject is seamless within a cartoon environment, though it does not achieve photorealism. Instead, it achieves visual coherence and matches the thematic tone suitable for a cartoon depiction. Hence, while the design fits well aesthetically, labeling it as photorealistic doesn't align with the artistic intent.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the proportions of the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger holding the skateboard realistic and does the action of holding the skateboard appear physically plausible?",
    "explanation": "Considering the exaggeration inherent in chibi art, Image B portrays the tiger with a relatively large head and small limbs typical of this art style. Despite these proportions, the depiction of the tiger grasping the skateboard seems physically plausible within the artistic context. The skateboard's size relative to the chibi tiger supports the illusion that it is held securely, maintaining internal coherence between the character’s actions and design proportions.",
