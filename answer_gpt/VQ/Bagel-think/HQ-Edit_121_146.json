      "question": "Does the glass candle chamber maintain consistent transparency and refractive qualities with natural glass, and are the embossed gold floral motifs clearly defined without distortion or unnatural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass candle chamber appears to maintain a natural transparency and refractive qualities as seen in typical glass materials. The embossed gold floral motifs are visually clear and well-defined. There's no apparent distortion or texture issues, suggesting the chamber adheres to typical characteristics of glasswork. These observations are based on the way light passes through the candle chamber and the clarity of the detailed motifs.",

      "question": "Is the camel red hue of the glass candle chamber evenly distributed and visually harmonious with the surrounding silver and gold elements, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural saturation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the glass chamber exhibits a consistent camel red hue. It harmonizes well with the decorative elements like silver and gold motifs, without abrupt shifts in color or saturation. The image showcases a balance between the colors and elements, presenting a cohesive visual appearance.",

      "question": "Does the wooden lid accurately reflect the contour and curvature of the original teapot handle, and does it display natural wood grain and polish without visible artifacts or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden lid is consistent with the handle's contour and curvature, as both feature similar design aesthetics. The wood grain appears natural and well-polished, without visible artifacts or distortions, indicative of realistic wooden finishes. This suggests the lid aligns with real-world woodwork appearances.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the brand logo positioned on the base in a way that aligns with the existing decorative elements, and does it lack jagged edges, misalignment, or unnatural contrast that would suggest digital insertion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no visible brand logo on the base, making it impossible to assess its alignment, edges, or contrast. Consequently, the assessment of whether the logo aligns with existing elements is not applicable.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the newly added patterned fabric background exhibit consistent texture, proper lighting interaction, and seamless integration with the teapot's shadow and reflection on the surface below, without visible seams or lighting discrepancies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a patterned fabric that interacts seamlessly with the teapot, particularly in the way shadows are cast and reflections appear. The texture seems consistent and integrated with the scene's lighting, maintaining realism without noticeable seams or discrepancies. This is determined by observing the cohesive lighting and shadow interactions between the objects and the fabric.",
