    "Question": "Q1: Are the stripes on the zebra consistent with its natural patterns without appearing as unnatural or disjointed lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra features bold black-and-white stripes, typical of zebra patterns. The stripes are evenly spaced and symmetrical across the body, which is characteristic of the natural stripe patterns seen on zebras. Analyzing these stripes involves recognizing they are consistent with the natural patterns due to their regular spacing and alignment, without any unnatural disjointed lines.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the zebra's ears maintain their natural upright position without any distortion or unnatural bending?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's ears are oriented vertically, which is consistent with the natural upright position zebras usually have. The ears are depicted without any visible distortion or bending that would suggest unnaturalness, reflecting realism in positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the zebra maintain realistic proportions in its limbs and body, avoiding any grossly exaggerated or distorted features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra features intentionally exaggerated proportions, typical of a cartoonish or stylized representation rather than realistic animal anatomy. The body and limbs are simplified and compact, typical of animated character designs, which differ noticeably from the real zebra proportions seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the texture of the zebra's coat smooth and free of unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra exhibits a smoothly textured coat consistent with claymation or cartoon styles. The surface is clean and uniform, devoid of artifacts or pixelation, indicating a stylized texture that focuses on design simplicity rather than realistic depiction as observed in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the grass around the zebra unaltered and free of any editing artifacts, maintaining its natural appearance?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not have any grass surrounding the zebra, unlike Image A, where the zebra is standing on a grassy field. Image B features a plain background, typically used for stylized or character-centric representations without background distractions, so the question on grass alteration does not apply.",
    "answer": "No"
