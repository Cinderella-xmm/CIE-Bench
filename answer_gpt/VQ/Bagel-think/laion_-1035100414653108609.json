    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the moss textures on the tusks follow the curvature of the tusks and cast consistent shadows matching the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the moss textures do not appear to be present on the tusks, focusing rather on the back and spine of the warthog. Hence, there are no moss textures on the tusks to evaluate their curvature and shadow consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the waterfall-like mane flow continuously from the top of the head downward without intersecting or distorting the snout or ear regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mane of the warthog flows continuously and naturally from the top of the head downwards. It seems to follow a natural path without intersecting or causing distortion to adjacent regions like the snout or ears. The hair-like textures maintain consistency with the warthog's anatomy, as typically expected.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the leaf-styled patterns aligned with the natural folds and contours of the warthog’s body, avoiding abrupt edges or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf-styled patterns, which could be interpreted as moss or fungi growths, are added to the body of the warthog. These patterns align with the folds and contours of its back and spine area, maintaining a fairly natural appearance without obvious abrupt edges or misalignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fungi positioned along the spine and upper back without overlapping legs or protruding unnaturally into the air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fungi are indeed positioned along the spine and back of the warthog, following a logical arrangement that suggests growth along these areas. Their placement avoids overlapping the legs or protruding awkwardly into the air, maintaining a natural harmony with the animal's form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing eyes remain within the eye sockets, preserving the shape of the eyelids and surrounding facial features without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the warthog’s eyes are exaggerated in color, they remain within the socket shapes provided by the facial features of the warthog. The eyelids and surrounding facial features are preserved without any distortion, maintaining the anatomical integrity of the face.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the branch-shaped hooves connect naturally to the lower legs and maintain consistent joint alignment without breaking the leg structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it appears that there are no branch-shaped hooves added or altered significantly, keeping consistency with the original structure and alignment of the warthog’s lower legs. The hooves connect naturally as typical for a warthog.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
