    "Question": "Q1: Does the key maintain its original geometric shape and proportions when transformed into a bridge, without any visible warping or stretching?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the part of the key that transforms into the bridge maintains its original geometric features, as seen from the consistent design pattern and proportions similar to Image A. This indicates no visible warping or stretching has occurred during the transformation into a bridge.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the tiny houses and trees positioned in a way that aligns with the wood grain’s depth and surface plane, without floating or appearing disconnected from the background?",
    "explanation": "The tiny houses and trees in Image B are depicted in such a way that they appear to be resting on the carved wooden hill, aligned with the surface plane of the wood grain. There is no appearance of them floating or being disconnected from the wood surface, indicating proper alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the resin river emerge smoothly from the key’s bit and flow with consistent material properties, showing no sharp breaks or unnatural color shifts?",
    "explanation": "The resin river in Image B emerges naturally from the bit of the key and flows downward. It possesses a uniformly smooth texture and consistent coloration, without noticeable sharp breaks or color shifts, ensuring a natural appearance consistent with realistic water flow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the boundary of the key case clearly defined and consistent with the wood grain and metallic tones of the key, without abrupt changes in texture or lighting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boundary of the key remains consistent with the metallic tones of the original key and fits harmoniously against the wood grain, without abrupt changes in texture or lighting. This ensures a uniform transition between the key and the surrounding wood surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the carved wooden hill seamlessly blended into the surrounding wood grain, with consistent texture and shading that suggests natural carving rather than digital patching?",
    "explanation": "The carved wooden hill in Image B is integrated into the wood grain with a texture and shading that maintains consistency throughout the image. This suggests a natural carving effect rather than digital patching, as it smoothly transitions into the surrounding wood grain.",
    "answer": "Yes"
