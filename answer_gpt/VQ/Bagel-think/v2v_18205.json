      "question": "Does the horse's musculature display intricate detail and natural texture without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's musculature is rendered with a high level of detail, showing pronounced muscles. However, the texture appears smooth and lacks the natural subtle variations typical of a horse's coat. This is due to the statue-like appearance, which shifts focus from realistic texture to the enhanced muscular definition commonly found in sculptural art, suggesting the presence of some unnaturalness in the representation.",

      "question": "Are the lighting effects on the horse and elephant consistent with a Renaissance-inspired style and do they enhance the anatomical features naturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting highlights the musculature and contours of the horse and elephant, using chiaroscuro to create dramatic contrast between light and shadowâ€”reminiscent of Renaissance art techniques. This emphasizes the forms and enhances the sculpted appearance of the animals, reflecting stylistic elements found in art from that period while adding a dramatic allure, but may lack the full natural finesse seen in anatomy-focused lighting.",

      "question": "Does the elephant's skin retain its natural texture and fine details without any visible degradation or unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in Image B has a smooth surface that resembles sculptural material rather than the wrinkle-filled, textured skin typical of real elephants. This lack of natural texture and detailed skin pattern indicates that the edited image prioritizes a unified artistic aesthetic presumably intended to resemble hard material like marble or ivory, which does not preserve the real skin details.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical structure of the horse and elephant appear rational and consistent with their anatomical forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse and elephant retain proportions that are consistent with their respective anatomical forms despite the stylized execution. The musculature of both animals is exaggerated to emphasize their physical forms artistically, yet it does not distort their overall proportions in a way that would be considered anatomically incorrect or irrational while maintaining coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition of the horse standing on a platform above the elephant visually credible and structurally coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B, showing an intricately detailed platform supporting the horse above the elephant, aligns with artistic expression rather than physical feasibility. While the idea is structurally coherent within the context of artistic renditions or sculptures, it does not convey the same rational feasibility as a mundane depiction due to absence of supportive elements ensuring stability, typical of such stylized concepts where credibility is not the priority.",
