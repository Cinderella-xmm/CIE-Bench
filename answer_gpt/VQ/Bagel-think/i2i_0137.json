      "question": "Does the teapot appear naturally integrated into the scene, maintaining texture and lighting similar to the surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is placed on the window sill in the central part of the image. It appears to have consistent lighting and shading with the surrounding environment, as the light source seems to be natural daylight coming from the window behind it. Given that other objects such as the plant pot and books also display similar lighting and materials, the teapot fits naturally into the scene, maintaining harmony with other elements in texture and lighting.",

      "question": "Are the two porcelain cups visually coherent with the setting, showing natural porcelain material and appropriate shadows on the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The porcelain cups in Image B are placed on the small round table between the two chairs. They exhibit a shiny surface typical of porcelain, reflecting the ambient light, and they cast realistic shadows on the table that are consistent with the direction of lighting in the room. This visual coherence integrates them naturally into the scene, appearing harmonious with other elements like the vase and books near them.",

      "question": "Do the new additions (teapot and porcelain cups) fit naturally within the room's ambiance without causing any visible distortions or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the teapot on the window sill and the porcelain cups on the table in Image B have been added with careful attention to the overall setting. They maintain the room's ambiance by adhering to the lighting, shading, and color palette present in the rest of the room. There are no visible distortions or inconsistencies between the added items and the original components of the scene. Thus, the integration appears seamless.",

      "question": "Are the teapot and porcelain cups appropriately sized and positioned on the table, maintaining proper proportions and structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot and porcelain cups are proportionately sized considering the human-scale dimensions of the furniture and other decorative items in the room. They are positioned in traditional, expected locations—on the window sill and the table—without causing imbalance or incoherence within the scene's composition.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the teapot and porcelain cups retain detailed textures and edges, ensuring they stand out clearly against the background without losing definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teapot and cups in Image B maintain well-defined edges and display detailed textures that are characteristic of ceramic material, which is evident through their reflective surfaces and consistent definition against both the brighter background and the table surface. This clarity helps them stand out just right to match the detailing in other objects in the room.",
