      "question": "Does the chibi character maintain the same pose and clothing details as the original image without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is in a seated position on a frame, different from the original standing pose in Image A. The clothing maintains a similar style, being all black and fitted, but the pose and depiction of the character as a chibi introduce a stylized form that alters proportions and introduces elements typical of chibi art, such as a larger head and smaller body, which are not present in the original image. Therefore, there are natural distortions as part of the chibi transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and fine details of the chibi character's clothing and skin natural and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clothing in Image B is consistent in color and basic design with the original image, maintaining an all-black outfit. However, the textures are much smoother and lack the realistic detail seen in Image A due to the chibi art style, which simplifies features for a more cartoonish appearance. Likewise, the skin also appears smoother and simplified, which is typical for chibi representations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi character's hands and legs match the original image without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character possesses exaggerated chibi features: small body, larger head, and simplified limb proportions. The hands and legs are notably different in size and proportion compared to the more realistic proportions in Image A. This distortion is intentional for stylistic effect but does not match the proportions of the original.",

      "question": "Does the placement of the chibi character sitting on the edge of the Instagram frame look natural and visually plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character in Image B is positioned to sit on the edge of the Instagram-like frame, which appears visually coherent within the chibi style context. The character's interaction with the frame is rendered to appear natural and purposeful, supporting the playful and stylized portrayal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the social media icons and the username \"Graceful\" integrated seamlessly into the scene without disrupting the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The social media icons and username in Image B are well-integrated into the frame design, maintaining a cohesive aspect with the overall art style. Their addition enhances the theme of the scene, aligning with the chibi character presentation and frame motif, rather than appearing out of place.",
