    "Question": "Q2: Do the arms feature calligraphic lines that follow the natural curvature of the limbs without distorting the hands or creating more than five fingers per hand?",
    "explanation": "The arms in Image B are depicted with elegant, calligraphic lines typical of Japanese woodblock art. These lines trace the arms’ natural curves without distortion and maintain an anatomically correct number of fingers—five per hand.
