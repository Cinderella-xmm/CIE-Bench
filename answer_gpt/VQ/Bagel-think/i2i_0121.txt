    "Q1": "Does the character maintain its structural consistency as a chibi version, with no disproportionate or overly exaggerated body parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is represented as a chibi version, which is a style characterized by its small and cute design with oversized heads compared to the body. The arms, legs, and torso are proportioned appropriately for this style, with no part appearing exaggerated or out of place. The key visual cues, such as the size of the hands and the shape of the body, align with the typical chibi style. Therefore, the character maintains its structural consistency.",
