    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features such as the nose, mouth, and whiskers preserved in shape and position after conversion to bronze, without visible distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the facial features cannot be assessed for preservation as the face is blurred and the relevant details are lost. Thus, the preservation of the nose, mouth, and whiskers cannot be confirmed.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bronze helmet properly scaled and positioned on the head, with smooth transitions at the edges and no visible gaps or misalignments with the skull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bronze object which resembles a helmet, and it seems to be correctly proportioned and positioned on the object. The edges are seemingly smooth and there are no visible gaps or misalignments apparent from the visibly helmet-like portion.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bronze-framed glasses sit correctly over the eyes without shifting or overlapping incorrectly, and do the lenses show realistic glass-like reflection and transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B is blurred over the area where the glasses would appear, it is impossible to confirm the correct placement, reflection, or transparency of the glasses based on the given image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, part of the sculpture below the blur seems to maintain the original shape of a garment with engraved details resembling a sweater. The lines follow the contours appropriately without visible breaks or artificial appearance.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, the marble base is directly beneath the bronze sculpture, showing appropriate contact points with no visible gaps. The base seems proportionally sized to support the sculpture, offering stability.",
