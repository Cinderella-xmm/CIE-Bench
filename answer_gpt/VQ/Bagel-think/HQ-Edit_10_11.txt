    "Question": "Q1: Does the entire body of the gorilla exhibit consistent wood texture and shading, with no sudden color changes or patches that appear non-wood-like?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla is represented as a carved wooden figure. The entire body exhibits a uniform brown wood texture, typical of carved wooden surfaces. There are no abrupt color changes or sections deviating from this texture, reflecting the craftsmanship of a wooden sculpture. This is recognizable through the consistent brown color and carved lines typical of wood art. Combining visual clues with knowledge of wood sculptures, the texture and shading appear consistent throughout.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the engraved fur patterns on the gorilla's body varied in depth and direction, resembling natural wood grain rather than repetitive or synthetic lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the engraved patterns on the surface of the gorilla do show variation in depth and direction, imitating natural wood grain. Each curve and line appears hand-carved, giving it a slightly irregular appearance that mimics natural grain rather than synthetic uniformity. Wood grain naturally varies in direction and depth, and this is portrayed throughout the body's surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the arms and legs retain anatomically correct proportions and joint structures, with no flattened or unnaturally curved sections due to excessive smoothing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla retains realistic proportions for its arms and legs, consistent with its anatomical structure despite the wood carving style. There is no excessive smoothing that distorts the natural curves and bends where joints would be positioned in a real gorilla. The wooden carving manages to maintain the integrity of anatomical correctness despite the stylization into wood.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background composed of etched wood patterns with darker leaf shapes integrated into it, maintaining depth and layering without appearing flat or disjointed from the gorilla?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B contains darker leaf shapes alongside lighter wood patterns that mimic depth and layering, convincingly integrating into the overall wooden aesthetic. This carved appearance gives complexity while remaining congruous with the foreground, avoiding a flat or disconnected appearance. The layering effect fits well with how wooden sculptures depict scenes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the scattered leaves in the background rendered in darker wood tones and placed in positions that suggest natural resting or embedding into the wooden surface, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves in the background are depicted in darker wood tones and appear strategically placed to suggest they are part of the overall wooden relief carving. They do not float or overlap inappropriately, but instead, follow the inherent logic of a detailed wooden sculpture, where elements are typically engraved in a layered manner to simulate depth and resting positions consistent with natural embedding.",
    "answer": "Yes"
