    "Question": "Q1: Does the entire cathedral structure appear uniformly rendered in warm stained wood with consistent grain patterns and realistic wood textures across all surfaces, including spires, arches, and tracery?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral structure indeed appears to be uniformly rendered with a wooden texture. The warm tone of the material and the visible wood grain patterns are consistent across different elements like spires, arches, and tracery. The use of these textures indicates that the model likely aims to mimic a wooden construction, even though small sections might be highlighted in other tones for accentuating details.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the edges of the shadow box clearly defined, structurally coherent, and proportionally sized relative to the cathedral model, with no visible gaps, misalignments, or floating components?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shadow box housing the cathedral model has a clearly defined frame with neat edges and a proportional size to the contents it encloses. There are no visible gaps, misalignments, or floating parts, which suggests careful assembly and attention to spatial coherence and proportion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the tiny pews and chandeliers positioned correctly within the interior of the cathedral model, maintaining proper scale and alignment with architectural features like columns and vaults, and do they cast consistent shadows?",
    "explanation": "The tiny pews are neatly lined up and scaled appropriately in relation to the size of the cathedral model, indicating proper placement within the context of the architectural features. However, their shadows are not visibly detailed enough to confirm consistent shadow casting. The chandeliers are not distinctly visible within the interior structure, making it challenging to assess their scale and positioning accurately.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the clock mechanism located at the back of the model, featuring visible gears and a moving path for small figures, with no distorted shapes, inconsistent materials, or implausible motion trajectories?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clock face visible on the front of the model rather than a mechanism at the back. While the model exhibits decorative detailing, there is no apparent complex clock mechanism with gears or pathways for figures visible. The description in the question does not match what is observable, indicating no such mechanism is present in the expected location.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the intricate gothic carvings, including the rose window, flying buttresses, and sculptural elements, retain sharp detail and accurate geometry in the miniature model without visible blurring, pixelation, or deformation?",
    "explanation": "The miniature model in Image B showcases intricate gothic carvings with distinct details, particularly on the rose window and architectural features like buttresses and arches. The geometric precision appears retained, and there is no noticeable blurring or pixelation affecting these ornamental elements, reflecting fidelity to the gothic style despite the miniature scale.",
    "answer": "Yes"
