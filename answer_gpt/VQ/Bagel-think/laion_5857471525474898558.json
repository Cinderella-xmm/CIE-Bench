      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the LEGO-style bricks on the building facade uniformly sized, aligned in rows, and free from visible texture repetition or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facade consists of red LEGO-style bricks that cover the entire surface of the building. These bricks appear to be uniformly sized and aligned in an orderly manner. The texture of the bricks does not present obvious repetition or blurring, as each brick exhibits a consistent and clear edge. This is in line with the typical characteristics of LEGO bricks, which are known for their uniform size and alignment. Therefore, based on the visual cues and the nature of LEGO bricks, the conclusion is that the bricks are uniformly sized and aligned correctly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the window frames appear as solid, blocky LEGO elements with consistent thickness and alignment, matching the original window positions and sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window frames have been converted into blocky LEGO-style elements. These elements appear solid and have a consistent thickness, which is typical of LEGO constructions. The frames align well with the positions and sizes of the original windows, as observed from their placement on the building facade. This uniformity reveals a faithful representation of LEGO characteristics while preserving the architectural integrity of the windows.",

      "question": "Do the green LEGO vines grow along the same vertical paths as the original plants, maintaining segmented, blocky forms without stretching or breaking continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green LEGO vines mimic the path of the original climbing plants from Image A. These vines maintain a segmented and blocky appearance, consistent with the texture and form of LEGO bricks. They grow vertically along the paths where the original plants were located and display continuity without unnatural stretching or disjointed segments. The depiction aligns with the notion of LEGO vines, preserving the original plant configuration.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gray LEGO railings on each balcony evenly spaced, horizontally aligned, and securely connected to the balcony base without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railings replace the original balcony elements with LEGO representations characterized by their gray color and blocky design. These railings are evenly spaced and horizontally aligned according to typical LEGO construction standards. They appear securely attached to the base of each balcony, ensuring that there is no visual indication of floating or incorrect overlapping. The precision with which these elements are rendered reflects the build style associated with LEGO pieces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a flat, level platform extending beneath the entire building base, positioned consistently with the sidewalk and not overlapping with parked vehicles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks a visible flat, level platform beneath the building that would be typical of a LEGO base. The conversion of the building into a LEGO style does not show any distinct LEGO base plate extending under the building. Furthermore, the alignment with the sidewalk and potential overlap with parked vehicles doesn't seem to be depicted as typical LEGO bases would connect seamlessly to other elements of a model. Hence, there is no benchmark platform at the building’s base level.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do all architectural elements—including windows, doors, balconies, and rooflines—remain in their original positions and maintain proper alignment and spacing relative to one another?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparing Image B with Image A, it's clear that all architectural elements such as windows, doors, balconies, and rooflines retain their original positions. Despite the conversion to a LEGO style, these elements maintain proper alignment and spacing relative to each other. The LEGO transformation meticulously preserves the structural order as seen in the original image, confirming their consistent placement and architectural flow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, color bleeding, or sharp edges at the borders between the LEGO building and the sky, trees, or parked cars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observation of Image B indicates a clean demarcation between the LEGO building and the surrounding environment such as the sky, trees, and parked cars. There are no visible seams or color bleeding that might indicate a sloppy transition between the LEGO structure and adjacent elements. The edges appear sharp and well-defined, which is consistent with the crisp lines typical of LEGO brick constructions. Therefore, the transition between the structure and its surroundings maintains a polished appearance without undesired artifacts.",
