    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D chibi version of the person in the foreground maintain the structural integrity of the suit and cup without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi version of the person in the foreground appears well-constructed. The suit jacket and tie contain enough detail to suggest typical business attire despite the chibi styling, which inherently involves simplified and exaggerated features. The cup is proportionate and recognizable with no obvious distortions. This suggests that the structural integrity is preserved without any unnatural textures.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the addition of the photo frame around the chibi-style 3D scene enhance the visual credibility and realism of the composition?",
    "explanation": "The photo frame in Image B provides a contextual boundary that enhances the presentation of the 3D scene, making it appear as an intentional styled artwork. This framing adds to the composition's realism by aligning with how such scenes might be exhibited for stylistic or artistic effect.",
