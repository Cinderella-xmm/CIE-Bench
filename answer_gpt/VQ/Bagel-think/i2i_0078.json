      "question": "Are there any visible seams or unnatural edges where the watch meets the new steampunk-style background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch is placed on a surface amidst a steampunk-style background. The process involves checking for visual anomalies where the watch and surface meet, such as jagged edges or mismatched textures that could indicate poor editing. Upon inspection, no distinct seams, rough edges, or mismatched portions are visible, indicating a seamless blend of the watch into the new environment.",

      "question": "Does the wristwatch retain its original proportions, geometric shapes, and fine details without distortion in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch's proportions, such as the round shape of the face and the links of the band, need to be consistent with a typical watch. By comparing these aspects with common wristwatch designs and the original image, it is noticeable that the watch maintains its correct geometric shapes and fine details like the markings on the watch face, suggesting no distortion.",

      "question": "Do the textures and finishes on the watch's metal band and face appear natural and detailed, matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the texture of the metal band and the clarity of details such as the watch face numerals and markings is crucial for assessing naturalness. The textures should be reflective yet not overly so, and should match the realistic sheen of metal without looking flat or artificial. The image displays these properties effectively, indicating natural textures that align with the watch's realistic portrayal.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the wristwatch match the light sources in the new steampunk-style train station background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the watch in a steampunk setting, where light sources include ambient and possibly direct lighting from the environment. The analysis involves checking the direction and softness of shadows on the watch, comparing them to those cast by nearby objects in the background. The watch shows a lighting pattern that aligns well with this new environment, displaying appropriately directed shadows and highlights.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the original lighting and shadows around the watch been preserved without introducing unrealistic contrasts or overly bright/dark areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The task is to determine if Image B maintains the watch's original shadow direction and light intensity from Image A without creating overly stark contrasts. The watch appears consistent in terms of lighting shadow interplay, which means the new image does not introduce unrealistic lighting elements or overly dramatic dark or bright areas compared to the original.",
