      "question": "Does the scarecrowâ€™s body exhibit a consistent glossy finish across all areas where straw was replaced, without visible seams, unnatural reflections, or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarecrow's body appears to be made of straw-like material with no visible glossy finish. The texture of the scarecrow's body, especially where it mimics straw, appears natural and consistent without any visible seams or texture mismatches. There are no signs of unnatural reflections that would indicate an altered surface material. Therefore, the scarecrow's body does not exhibit a glossy finish.",

      "question": "Is the hat structurally intact and proportionally consistent with the original, featuring a clearly defined opening at the top that allows for candle placement without distorting its shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarecrow's hat appears structurally intact, maintaining a consistent proportion relative to the scarecrow's head. However, there is no indication of an opening at the top meant specifically for candle placement. The hat looks complete without any visible modifications or distortions that suggest an opening.",

      "question": "Are the LED string lights positioned along the scarecrow or packaging in a way that emits soft, localized light without causing unnatural bright spots, flickering effects, or visible wiring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LED string lights are visually integrated along the packaging. They emit a warm, soft light that enhances the display without causing any unnatural bright spots or flickering effects. The wiring is not prominently visible, maintaining a clean appearance. The light distribution seems well-designed, avoiding harsh lighting or technical flaws.",

      "question": "Is the crow figurine resting stably on the top edge of the box, aligned with gravitational logic, and matching the size and proportions of the birds seen in flight in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crow figurine is positioned on the top edge of the box in a manner that appears stable and aligns with gravitational logic. Its size and proportions are consistent with the visual context set by the background birds, as the figurine does not appear overly large or out of place when compared to the birds flying in the distance.",

      "question": "Does the packaging surrounding the scarecrow have clean edges, consistent material shading, and proper shadow alignment with the light source, indicating a solid, three-dimensional box structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging around the scarecrow is presented as a solid three-dimensional box structure. The edges of the packaging are clean and well-defined, and the material shading appears consistent, supporting the illusion of depth. Shadows are properly aligned with the light source, enhancing the realism and solidity of the box.",
