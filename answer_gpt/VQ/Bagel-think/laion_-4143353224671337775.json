      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the beige and brown puzzle pieces uniformly aligned and interlocked across the surface of the sculpture without visible gaps, misalignments, or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the puzzle pieces make up a three-dimensional structure that resembles the form of a creature. These pieces are designed to interlock, and from the visual cues, they appear to be arranged uniformly across the surface. There are no noticeable gaps or misalignments visible, suggesting that they are well-aligned and fitted together without any jagged edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the edges of the puzzle pieces follow the natural curvature of the original ceramic head shape without abrupt angular deviations or unnatural flattening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a sculpture made of distinct puzzle pieces that form a regular geometric shape rather than the smooth, natural curves seen in traditional ceramic sculptures. The angular deviations are visible, indicating that the puzzle piece design intentionally incorporates such geometry, rather than following a natural curvature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the green puzzle fragment on the top of the head smooth and free of rough textures, cracks, or color variations that contrast with the surrounding beige and brown puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green puzzle fragment atop the sculpture appears to have a smooth surface without notable texture inconsistencies or cracks. Although its green color contrasts with the beige and brown pieces beneath it, the visual inspection does not show rough textures or cracks, maintaining a uniform surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed horizontally on the white shelf with stable contact and no floating or tilting effects, maintaining a natural shadow and perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sculpture positioned on a white shelf, resting steadily and parallel to the surface. There is no indication that the sculpture is floating or tilting, and the shadows beneath are consistent with stable contact, preserving a realistic shadow and perspective.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, eyebrows, mouth, ears) clearly preserved in shape and proportion despite being integrated into the puzzle piece design, without deformation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B appear integrated into the puzzle design with distinct eyes, eyebrows, and mouth visible. The integration process does not seem to have deformed these features or blurred their shapes, ensuring their shape and proportion are clearly preserved.",
