    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brass and copper textures on the headdress and face uniformly smooth and reflective, without visible noise, patchy areas, or abrupt transitions between adjacent segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the headdress in Image B reveals intricate detailing typical of brass and copper materials, maintaining a polished finish with no visible noise or patchy areas. The segments transition smoothly, supporting a coherent texture without abrupt changes. This is indicative of high-quality rendering often associated with mechanical designs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the vertical and horizontal stripes of the nemes headdress retain their original alignment and spacing, with no bending, stretching, or misalignment caused by the addition of mechanical parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nemes headdress is integrated with mechanical elements, yet the stripes maintain alignment and spacing consistent with traditional depictions. This suggests careful consideration during editing to preserve the original structure despite the added elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the mechanical wings symmetrically placed on either side of the head or shoulders, with clean edges, defined joints, and emerald accents that do not appear floating or disconnected from the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows mechanical wings positioned symmetrically with clean edges and well-defined joints. The emerald accents are integrated into the design, coherently placed and connected, giving a feeling of stability rather than floating.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the clockwork designs on the collar clearly defined and evenly spaced, with steam exhaust pipes attached at plausible locations and angles, and no overlapping or clipping with surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clockwork designs on the collar in Image B are meticulously rendered with well-defined components. The steam exhaust pipes are placed at logical locations and angles, exhibiting no overlapping or clipping, which indicates a precise and thoughtful design approach.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the vapor emerging from the steam exhaust pipes translucent and softly diffused, with no sharp edges, pixelation, or unnatural clustering that suggests digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, vapor from the exhaust pipes appears naturally translucent and softly diffused, avoiding digital artifacting signs such as pixelation or unnatural clustering. This contributes to the realism and quality of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the eyes, nose, and mouth proportionally aligned and anatomically correct, with no warping, elongation, or asymmetry caused by the integration of gears or other mechanical elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the face is blurred, the integration of gears and mechanical parts seems to be planned in such a way as not to warp or elongate these features. This approach typically aims to maintain anatomical correctness, which is essential when objects are embedded in facial designs.",
