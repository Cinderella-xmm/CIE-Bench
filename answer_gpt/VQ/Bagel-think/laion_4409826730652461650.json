      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and mouth of the horse in both panels correctly positioned and proportionally consistent with the original plush design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and mouth of the horse in both panels seem to be stylized, as is common for cartoon depictions. In Image B, the eyes are round with an animated appearance, and the mouth is simplified into a basic smile. In Image A, the plush horse displays a more detailed, plush toy-like design. The plush horse has embroidered or plastic eyes and a stitched smile, which are designed to appear soft and cute. The stylization in Image B does not maintain the proportional accuracy and positioning of the plush toy's facial details. Therefore, they do not match the original design in their exact positioning or proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lasso above the horse's head shaped naturally and positioned so that it appears to be twirling in mid-air without intersecting or clipping through the horse's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lasso is depicted as a simple loop above the horse's head in the bottom panel. The loop appears to be floating in the air, indicating movement as if it is being swung. Importantly, it does not intersect or clip through the body of the horse, maintaining a clear, separate appearance. This creates a natural visual representation of a lasso in motion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cacti and wooden saloon buildings in the background align with the horizon line and cast shadows consistent with the light source direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements such as the cacti and the wooden saloon buildings are aligned in a visually coherent way with respect to their positioning on the horizon. However, there are no distinct shadows visible, likely due to the stylized and simplified nature of the cartoon scene. Without clear shadow depiction, we cannot assume consistency in their alignment with the light source direction.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fur texture of the horse and the plastic details of the rocking base clearly visible and not blurred or oversimplified due to stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the fur texture of the horse and the details of the rocking base are highly simplified as part of the cartoon style. Instead of detailed textures, the image uses solid colors and simple outlines to convey form, a common choice in stylized art. These elements are intentionally simplified, losing the detailed texture apparent in Image A, where the plush fur and plastic parts are clearly visible. This stylization results in oversimplification.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text “Wild, Wild Horse Adventures!” positioned at the top of the image without overlapping any part of the horse or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text at the top does not read “Wild, Wild Horse Adventures!” but instead reads “Wild Bro Dearrin Dardnes!” This text is placed above the panels, not interfering with the horse's or background elements, which generally allows the focus to remain on the illustrated scenes. However, since it overlaps with the top part of the image, different from what is stated in the question, this isn't relevant here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the legs and rocking base of the horse proportionally accurate and aligned with the original mechanical structure, even after stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's legs and the rocking base have been simplified for a cartoon aesthetic. The stylization focuses more on a playful representation rather than proportional accuracy to the actual toy. Compared to the original Image A, where the mechanics and structure are realistically proportioned, the stylized version in Image B deviates in both alignment and proportion, emphasizing caricature over exactness.",
