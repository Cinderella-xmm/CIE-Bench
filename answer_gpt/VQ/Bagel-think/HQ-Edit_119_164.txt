    "Question": "Q1: Do the celestial sails replacing the elephant's ears maintain a consistent size and attachment point relative to the head, without warping or unnatural stretching of the surrounding skin?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's ears are replaced by visual elements resembling celestial sails with planets. These elements maintain symmetry with the head and appear naturally attached without obvious distortion of surrounding skin. When examining such edits, look for unnatural drags, stretches, or mismatches in size, which are not observed here.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the cosmic mist emanating from the tip of the trunk smoothly integrated into the scene without jagged edges, overlapping artifacts, or inconsistent opacity?",
    "explanation": "The image depicts cosmic mist emerging from the trunk tip, seamlessly transitioning into the environment. The mist maintains consistent opacity and clear definition, showing no jagged edges or unwanted overlaps. Smooth transitions suggest proper integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the planetary rings around the elephant's legs evenly spaced and aligned with the limb axes, without clipping into the leg surface or appearing misaligned due to perspective?",
    "explanation": "The rings depicted around the elephant's legs are visually consistent with natural alignment to the leg’s axes and appear to extend entirely around without clipping. They are evenly spaced, suggesting correct integration without perspective distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the luminescent star patterns on the elephant’s feet appear embedded within the foot surface rather than floating above it, with no haloing or color spill onto adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "The luminescent star patterns on the elephant’s feet appear fully integrated without a floating or detached appearance. They blend seamlessly within the textured surface of the foot, showing no haloing or color spill into nearby areas.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the galaxy-patterned skin follow the natural folds and creases of the elephant’s body, maintaining consistent texture resolution and avoiding abrupt transitions or stretched patterns?",
    "explanation": "The galaxy-patterned skin on the elephant in Image B harmonizes with its natural folds and creases, displaying a consistent texture resolution. There are no abrupt pattern changes or stretches noticeable upon careful examination, suggesting a well-executed transformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
