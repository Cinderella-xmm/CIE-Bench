    "Question": "Q1: Are the wooden planks on the walls seamlessly integrated with no visible gaps, misalignment, or unnatural texture repetition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden planks on the house walls in the 3D rendering are consistently colored and appropriately textured. There are no signs of gaps or misalignment that would disrupt the seamless integration. In architectural design and image rendering, seamless planks are crucial for realistic depiction. Observing the image shows structured and uniform alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the moss texture cover only appropriate surfaces (e.g., lower stone blocks, corners) and appear layered and organic without floating or flat patches?",
    "explanation": "The moss in Image B appears on regions likely to experience organic growth, such as the roof edges and stone foundations. These surfaces would naturally harbor moss due to moisture retention. The texture is layered and follows the contours of the surface, not exhibiting flat or unrealistic patches.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the roof tiles, walls, and wooden elements uniformly adjusted to earthy tones without inconsistent color gradients or localized discoloration?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows uniform harmony of colors across the roof, walls, and wooden elements. Earthy tones are appropriately used without noticeable variations in color gradients or discoloration, ensuring a visually coherent rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the miniature characters correctly scaled relative to the house and positioned in plausible locations (e.g., near doors, paths) without floating or intersecting with structures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are sized appropriately relative to the house, suggesting they are humanoid miniatures. They are placed near logical positions such as doors where interaction is plausible, and they are grounded, showing no floating or structural intersection.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the parchment board positioned flat on the ground with realistic folds, texture, and shadow alignment matching the light source direction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the parchment board is laid flat, with visible texture attributes appropriate to the material type. It aligns with the light source, allowing shadows to form correctly, hinting at realistic presentation despite its stylized art theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the rule booklets have consistent page thickness, visible spine details, and shadows that align with the lighting and surface they rest on?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays rule booklets with detailed features like consistent page thickness and spines. They convey tangible realism in shadows, consistent with the depicted lighting, adding to the overall believable representation within the stylized context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
