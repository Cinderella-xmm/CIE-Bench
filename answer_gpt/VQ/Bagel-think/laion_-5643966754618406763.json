    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the tread patterns on the tire surfaces preserved and reinterpreted as armored segments with no visible texture repetition or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature design suggests the use of elements that resemble tire tread patterns as part of its armored segments. The body of the creature, notably the back, maintains a similar, rugged and textured appearance akin to tire treads. These textures do not show noticeable repetition or degradation in detail, indicating an effective reinterpretation. This observation suggests careful design alignment with the original tire concept, maintaining continuity while adapting it creatively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic joints within the wheel openings align properly with the original rim shape and appear physically connected without gaps or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a creatively designed creature with metallic joints and areas that would represent its limbs or connectivity areas. These joints are designed to integrate with cylindrical elements, likely analogous to wheel or axle components. The visual cues display a cohesive attachment, aligning well with the design's intended look, without apparent gaps or issues. Without referring back to Image A, these joints appear logically structured without visible deformation, demonstrating an understanding of mechanical connections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glowing mechanical eyes centered within the hub openings, emitting light consistently without haloing, pixelation, or unnatural brightness spillage onto adjacent surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is designed with visually striking luminous elements that resemble eyes. These 'eyes' are located in the creature's head area. The glow effect is consistent, concentrated within the intended areas, and does not exhibit any digital artifacts like haloing or pixelation. The brightness is controlled, preventing unwanted spill onto surroundings, which helps maintain a clean design. This implies a balanced and controlled lighting effect, showcasing effective illumination design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the antennae attached to the upper portion of the tire stack with continuous, smooth geometry and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the creature with prominent blue antennae features extending from what would be the head area. These antennae are depicted as firmly attached to the creature, ensuring they appear continuous with the overall form. There are no signs of disconnection from the creature or floating segments, indicating a smooth and seamless integration of these design elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire structure composed of the tires forming a unified, balanced creature shape with no missing, duplicated, or incorrectly scaled parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a cohesive creature design where each component contributes to an overall unified appearance. All parts, including limbs, body, and other elements are proportionate and well-placed, forming a balanced visual composition. There are no duplicated or disproportionate aspects, ensuring the creature maintains an organic structure.",
