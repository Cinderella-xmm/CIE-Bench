      "question": "Do the clothing materials on both individuals display natural fabric textures consistent with denim and woven southwestern textiles, without visible artifacts or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements include what appears to be clothing in a western theme. However, there aren't any clear detailed views of denim or woven textiles visible. Also, there might not be sufficiently detailed texture due to the artistic style used in the edited image. Hence, when analyzing this question, it's pertinent to note that while elements may attempt to mimic these natural textures, the assessment of 'natural fabric textures' cannot be affirmed to be clear, visible, and artifact-free within this stylized context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cacti silhouettes and setting sun elements blended naturally into the wooden background without causing misalignment, unnatural shadows, or color inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image with cacti and setting sun silhouettes is more graphical and stylized, with no detailed rendering of natural elements. While it may artistically integrate with the image's theme, the blending is not realistic, and the elements do not integrate naturally with a photographic wooden background due to the lack of realistic shadows and consistent colors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the new band name text in the banner use a distressed font style that appears handcrafted and consistent with the western theme, without jagged edges or unnatural texture application?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the band name text is portrayed in a distressed font style that aligns with a western theme. Such distressing appears to be intentional, giving it a handcrafted look. The stylized appearance fits consistently with the theme without visible unnatural texture application or jagged edges beyond artistic choice.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are any newly added cowboy boots or hats positioned with correct proportions and perspective relative to the individuals and background, without appearing distorted or detached from the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cowboy boots and hat are part of a stylized illustration. Their positioning is consistent with the graphic style and doesn't rely on realistic proportions or perspective typical in a photograph. While they fit into the graphical theme, they appear more as decorative illustrations than objects integrated into a natural scene.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall layout of the edited image balanced, with all added elements (text, props, background details) properly aligned and spaced to avoid visual clutter or imbalance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall layout in Image B is designed to be balanced with symmetrically placed elements, such as the sun, cactus, hats, and boots, along with the text. While the style is graphical, it maintains a thematic consistency and spacing that avoids clutter, illustrating a balance typical of a stylized design rather than a real-life scene.",
