      "question": "Are the edges of the church’s spire and rooflines smooth and continuous without jagged breaks or warped segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church's spire and rooflines are depicted with clean, straight lines and sharp angles, typical of digital artwork. There are no apparent disruptions or inconsistencies in the flow of the lines, suggesting they are smooth and continuous. The vector-like art style contributes to this effect, making the edges look polished and intentional.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the left and right halves of the church’s façade mirror each other exactly, causing any misalignment in window positions or wall contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a highly symmetrical design, which is common in illustrations focusing on architectural aesthetics. The windows, arches, and overall structure appear to be evenly distributed on both sides of the façade. This suggests careful symmetry without visible misalignment, aiming for a balanced and harmonious composition.",

      "question": "Does the metallic gold accent on the spire have a uniform, reflective appearance without clashing textures or unnatural glow spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spire in Image B is colored with a metallic gold accent that is visually consistent across its surface. The use of light and shadow conveys a reflective quality typical of metal, providing a smooth and even look. There are no overly bright or dull areas that would indicate unnatural glow spots or texture inconsistencies.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the height of the spire proportionally balanced with the width and height of the church’s main body, avoiding extreme vertical stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportion between the spire and the church's body is balanced, making the structure appear visually cohesive. The spire is tall but not disproportionate compared to the width and height of the main building, maintaining an aesthetic harmony without extreme elongation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The celestial background in Image B features smooth gradients and complementary colors that blend naturally into the sky above the church. The elements like stars and moons are intentionally placed, creating a seamless integration with the church, without any noticeable hard transitions or floating elements that seem out of place.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church's architectural features such as the window frames, arches, and roof tiles are clearly represented through simple yet distinct lines. These elements, although rendered in a stylized manner, remain visible and identifiable, contributing to the church’s character while maintaining clarity in the illustration.",

There is no evidence of clipping or distortion along these edges, indicating that the image is well-contained within the frame boundaries without any stretching or compression.",
