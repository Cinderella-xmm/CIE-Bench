    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass dome surrounding the eagle exhibit natural transparency, smooth curvature, and realistic light refraction without distorting the eagle or background clouds?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome surrounding the eagle appears clear, with smooth curvature, indicating its transparency. There is no visible distortion of the eagle or the clouds inside, and the light refraction seems realistic. Combining visual cues with knowledge of glass properties, such as transparency and light refraction behavior, confirms that the dome's appearance is natural and it does not affect the visual perception of objects inside in a negative way.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the miniature clouds beneath the eagle’s wings three-dimensional, properly lit, and textured to match natural cloud formations without appearing artificial or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "The miniature clouds in Image B seem three-dimensional, as they have depth and shadowing indicating proper lighting. The texture appears to resemble natural cloud formations with soft contours. By combining visual analysis with knowledge of cloud structures and lighting effects, the clouds do not appear artificial or misaligned within the overall setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the gold leaf detail on the miniature clouds applied in a way that shows fine, reflective metallic texture without disrupting the cloud’s natural appearance or creating harsh highlights?",
    "explanation": "The gold leaf detail in Image B is visible on the compass roses rather than the clouds themselves. However, the metallic texture appears fine and reflective. By understanding metallic textures and examining the application, it's noted that the gold detail complements rather than disrupts the overall appearance, suggesting careful application.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the dark wood base have natural wood texture, proper polish finish, and clearly engraved text, and is it positioned stably beneath the dome without appearing disconnected or disproportionately sized?",
    "explanation": "The wood base in Image B shows what appears to be a natural wood grain texture, suggesting a proper polish finish. The text on the base is clear and legible, and the base is positioned stably, proportionate to the dome's size. By evaluating the aesthetics and comparing with realistic wooden objects, the base appears appropriate and not disconnected.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the brass compass roses evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and rendered with realistic metallic texture and scale relative to the dome and base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the compass roses are evenly spaced inside the dome and feature a realistic metallic texture. Their shape is consistent with typical compass rose designs, and they seem well-scaled relative to the eagle and the glass dome. By using knowledge of metallic objects and symmetry, these elements are consistent with realistic models.",
    "answer": "Yes"
