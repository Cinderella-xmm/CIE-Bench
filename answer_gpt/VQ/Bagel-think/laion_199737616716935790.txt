    "Question": "Q1: Are the black and blue brick textures on the motorcycle body panels uniformly aligned and geometrically consistent with the original angular design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is constructed from interlocking bricks, which inherently have a blocky and geometric design. The black and blue bricks align with the motorcycle's structure, but due to bricks' nature, they introduce a more stepped and segmented look rather than smooth or angular outlines typical of a real motorcycle. Therefore, while the alignment follows the contours, it is not smooth and angular like a non-brick design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the cog-patterned rims maintain circular shape and evenly spaced teeth that match the wheel diameter and do not appear stretched or broken?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle's wheels are made of circular brick elements with a cog pattern. These elements are consistent with the LEGO brick style, maintaining a circle with evenly spaced detailing that resembles teeth. They do not appear stretched or broken when considering the construction constraints of the brick format.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the colorful decals seamlessly embedded into the brick surface, showing no visible gaps, overlaps, or unnatural layering effects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no colorful decals visible on the brick motorcycle's surface. The model relies on the brick color themselves to provide visual interest, rather than using applied decals on the surface. This means there are no issues with gaps, overlaps, or unnatural layering.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the gray baseplate flat, continuous, and properly supporting the motorcycleâ€™s wheels without any visible elevation mismatch or distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is placed on a gray baseplate typical of LEGO constructions, which appears flat and continuous. It supports the motorcycle's wheels without visible elevation mismatch or distortion, facilitating a stable display of the model.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the display case have clear, undistorted boundaries with no ghosting, refraction errors, or unintended shadows affecting the motorcycle's appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the display case surrounding the motorcycle appears clear, with well-defined boundaries. There is no evidence of ghosting, refraction errors, or unintended shadows affecting the motorcycle's visibility within the case. This suggests a clean and transparent enclosure typical of a well-designed display case.",
    "answer": "Yes"
