    "Question": "Q1: Does the surface of the painted figure show consistent brushstroke patterns and subtle texture variations typical of oil paint on wood, without blocky or repetitive digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The edited image depicts a highly stylized and digital painting rendition of what seems to be Leonardo da Vinci. The image uses bold colors and clear lines, typical of digital artwork. Brushstroke patterns or texture variations indicative of traditional oil painting are absent, and the image has a smoother, more vibrant texture found in digital art forms. Thus, it shows digital artifacts rather than characteristics of oil paint on wood.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the strands of the elongated beard and mustache maintain continuous, fiber-like structure without forming unnatural loops, droplets, or fluid-like surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the beard appears stylized to match the overall digital and surreal appearance of the image. While there are clear, continuous strands of hair, the stylization implies some fluidity and lacks the fiber-like detail characteristic of realistic hair depiction. However, there are no obvious unnatural loops or fluid-like surfaces specific to overt digital manipulations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the velvet texture of the cloak smooth and reflective with depth, and are the golden embroidery lines evenly spaced and aligned with the fabric folds?",
    "explanation": "The edited image shows a cloak that is highly stylized, with an emphasis on bold coloring and smooth textures typical of digital images rather than realistic material textures. The embroidery is characterized by stylized, ornate gold patterns that are consistent but lack realistic fabric alignment due to the emphasis on an artistic rather than realistic portrayal.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the wide-brimmed hat positioned correctly on the head without distorting the skull shape, and are the peacock feathers attached along the brim with natural curvature and no clipping into the face?",
    "explanation": "The wide-brimmed hat in the edited image is artistically rendered and sits evenly atop the figure's head, with peacock feathers embellishing the rim. The feathers exhibit a natural curvature and do not appear to clip into the figure, indicating consistent design intent and proper positioning relative to the head.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the brooch cast a soft shadow onto the cloak and reflect light consistently with its surroundings, indicating proper placement and integration?",
    "explanation": "The brooch in the edited image is ornately styled, with bright, bold gold tones typical of digital artwork. While it is visually framed well within the design, the emphasis on flat, vivid color does not replicate realistic shadowing or lighting consistent with natural environments. Thus, it lacks realistic light interaction reflective of its surroundings.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the edges of the figure cleanly separated from the background without haloing, double outlines, or partial transparency that suggests poor compositing?",
    "explanation": "The figure in the edited image is outlined cleanly against the backdrop. The pristine digital stylization ensures that there is no haloing or transparency issues evident, common in poorly composited images. The distinction between the central figure and the digitally rendered background is clean.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the eyes, nose, and mouth aligned symmetrically and proportionally consistent with the original face, with no stretching or warping caused by adjacent edits?",
    "explanation": "Given the constraints to exclude the evaluation of the blurred face, no assessment of the eyes, nose, or mouth is possible in relation to their positioning or symmetry on the figure. The question cannot be answered based on visible features.",
    "answer": "No"
