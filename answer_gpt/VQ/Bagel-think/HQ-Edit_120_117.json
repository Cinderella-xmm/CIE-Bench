      "question": "Is the outer surface of the globe smooth and uniformly curved without visible distortion or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outer surface of the globe appears rounded and smooth, as expected for a glass or plastic sphere. There are no visible distortions or jagged edges that could disrupt the curve. The clarity of the scene within the globe suggests a uniform curvature. Common knowledge about globes and spherical objects indicates that they are typically manufactured to have smooth and even surfaces.",

      "question": "Does the miniature lighthouse inside the globe have accurate window placements and structural symmetry matching the original lighthouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature lighthouse in Image B displays consistency with typical lighthouse design, featuring windows and structural details similar to those seen in real-life counterparts. The window placements and structural symmetry visibly resemble those in the original lighthouse from Image A. Comparing both images shows that the window placements on the lighthouse in Image B are accurately modeled after those in Image A, demonstrating structural symmetry. Knowledge of architectural design supports the identification of these features as correct representations.",

      "question": "Are the waves made of translucent blue resin visually continuous with smooth surfaces and subtle internal reflections, showing no blocky or fragmented textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waves surrounding the miniature lighthouse appear to be made of a translucent material, likely resin. They have a smooth surface with subtle internal reflections that suggest a continuous flow, indicative of materials designed to mimic realistic ocean waves. There are no blocky or fragmented textures visible, and the waves blend seamlessly with the scene inside the globe. World knowledge tells us that resin is often used for such miniature and decorative objects due to its ability to produce smooth, reflective surfaces.",

      "question": "Is the wooden base flat and grounded beneath the globe, with visible wood grain and engraved lines that follow a consistent radial pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the globe in Image B appears well-grounded and flat as is typical for a supporting fixture. There is a visible wood grain texture, and the compass engraving displays consistent radial patterns indicative of quality craftsmanship. These elements provide structural integrity and visual appeal consistent with common woodwork standards. Comparing with the base of a typical globe or decorative item suggests that such designs are intended to be flat and stable.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the painted clouds and distant mountains located behind the globe, creating a sense of depth without overlapping or intersecting with the globe's surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painted clouds and mountains are positioned such that they create a backdrop visible through the clear surface of the globe. This arrangement supports a depth perspective, as none of these elements overlap or intersect with the globe itself. This positioning is consistent with creating an illusion of extended space behind glass objects. World knowledge about artistic practices in rendering depth helps understand the visual cues presented by this arrangement.",

      "question": "Do the rocks display earthy brown and green tones while the water shows vibrant blue with gradient shading, maintaining color harmony across the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocks inside the globe exhibit earthy brown and green tones, while the water is depicted in vibrant blue with gradient shading. This color scheme is harmonious and typical in coastal or maritime depictions where elements of nature are involved. Comparing to Image A, the colors are consistent with natural environments, suggesting a harmonious use of color that enhances realism and visual appeal based on common knowledge of color theory and natural settings.",
