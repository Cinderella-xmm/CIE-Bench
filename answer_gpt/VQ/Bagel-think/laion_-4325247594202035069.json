      "question": "Are the surfaces of all four figures covered in soft-looking fabric with consistent, non-repeating bold patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow, and do they lack visible seams, pixelation, or artificial textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each figure's surface is covered with a soft-looking fabric featuring bold, colorful patterns. The patterns are consistent across all figures without repeating and are prominently in blue, green, red, and yellow. The fabric is smooth, lacking any visible seams, pixelation, or artificial textures suggesting that these figures are plush toys or decorative items rather than hard-surfaced models.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the legs and arms of all four figures morph into exaggerated fins and tails in a way that maintains their original dynamic poses without broken geometry or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures, which are fish-shaped plush toys, naturally feature fins and tails as part of their design. These elements are integral to any fish-themed plush toy and do not result from morphing limbs into exaggerated features. Instead, the plush toys are designed from the outset with fins and tails, so the original poses of any model figures with arms and legs are not maintained, as there is no evidence of transformation from an anthropomorphic shape.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the weapons of each figure been reimagined as integrated fish-like features (such as fins or tail extensions) without floating or misaligned components that break physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows plush toy fish without any additional elements or features that suggest conversions from weapons. The toys' design includes features like fins and tails which fit within the theme of marine life but aren't transformations of weapons. Therefore, there is no indication of transforming weapons into fish-like elements without breaking physical logic as no remnants of weapons are visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a textured sandy fabric surface with subtle shading and depth, and are all four figures positioned naturally on it without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears to be made of a sandy, textured fabric, giving it a naturalistic appearance with shading and depth consistent with a fabric surface. The figures, being plush toys, are laid on this fabric surface seamlessly without any apparent issues of floating or clipping, giving the scene a coherent and natural look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands of each figure retain a natural number of fingers (no more than five), maintain ergonomic grip positions, and show no signs of deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are plush toy fish which do not have human-like hands or fingers. As fish do not possess hands, this question does not apply to the subjects in Image B. Therefore, there cannot be an assessment of fingers, ergonomic grip positions, or deformation as those features are absent from the outset.",
