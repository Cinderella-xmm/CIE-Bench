    "Question": "Q1: Do the hummingbird's wings display a seamless, continuous iridescent glass-like texture with natural light reflection and rainbow color gradients, free from jagged edges or artificial-looking patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hummingbird's wings show vibrant colors with a rainbow gradient, suggesting a glass-like texture. The colors blend smoothly from one to another without apparent jagged edges or abrupt transitions between colors. Without comparing to Image A first, these observations indicate an iridescent glass-like appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the luminescent petals covering the hummingbird’s body arranged in a way that follows the bird’s body contours without gaps, overlaps, or unnatural spacing, and do they exhibit consistent lighting and translucency?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the petals covering the hummingbird's body are arranged in a flowing manner, following the body’s shape closely, with consistent spacing. The lighting and translucency appear even across these petals, contributing to a cohesive appearance in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the crystalline spout seamlessly integrated into the hummingbird’s head, with realistic internal refraction and a coherent, gravity-consistent flow of nectar emerging from its tip?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible crystalline spout integrated into the hummingbird’s head, nor is there any depiction of nectar flowing from it. Thus, based on visual evidence alone, this feature is absent.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the trailing vines and blossoms extending from the hummingbird’s tail maintain natural growth patterns, with gradual tapering and evenly spaced flowers, and do they avoid appearing stiff or unnaturally rigid?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show any trailing vines and blossoms extending from the hummingbird’s tail. The tail maintains a consistent rainbow color gradient, without any extensions like vines or flowers, thus not exhibiting any growth patterns.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the transformed hummingbird cast a shadow consistent with the ambient lighting direction and intensity, and does its overall appearance harmonize with the surrounding garden elements in terms of color temperature and luminosity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hummingbird's appearance is vivid and bright, with colors harmonizing with the surrounding garden’s vibrant flowers. The lighting seems consistent, suggesting harmony in luminosity. No prominent shadow is visibly cast by the hummingbird, which might indicate inconsistency, yet the overall appearance blends well with the environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
