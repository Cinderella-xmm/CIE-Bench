      "question": "Does the marble grotto structure exhibit uniform stone-like texture and natural veining throughout, without artificial-looking smoothness or irregular patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grotto structure includes columns and arches. The visual cues show a texture that simulates marble with veining typically found in real marble, suggesting an attempt to imitate a stone-like surface. However, the smoothness of the surface might indicate an artificial look rather than a meticulously detailed stone texture, suggesting modern materials rather than carved stone. The answer hinges on the perceived authenticity of this texture compared to natural marble.",

      "question": "Do the porcelain figurines retain accurate anatomical proportions and facial features without deformation, and do they display a consistent glossy finish across all surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The porcelain figurines in Image B are designed with simplified and stylized features which align with artistic choices rather than realistic anatomical proportions. The inherent properties of porcelain provide a glossy finish, which is visible across all visible surfaces in the image. Despite their stylization, the consistency in their glossy surfaces is apparent, making this aspect clear.",

      "question": "Are the gold leaf details confined to garment edges and halos, applied evenly and without overlapping or smudging, and do they reflect light naturally without creating harsh highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, certain figurines have gold leaf details on their garments and halos. The gold appears applied in a neat fashion, confined primarily to the edges and details, avoiding overlaps or smudges. It reflects light in a way that captures a natural glossy appearance without creating distracting highlights. The application seems controlled and precise, indicating careful craftsmanship.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the packaging clearly visible surrounding the figurine set, featuring a branded exterior and dark velvet lining that supports the figures without compressing or distorting them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine set in Image B is encased in a packaging structure with clear outlines. The exterior appears elegant and likely branded judging by the luxurious setting, while the interior features what looks like a dark, velvet-like material that supports the figures and provides contrast without any visible compression or distortion, holding them in place securely.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the columns and arches of the marble grotto properly scaled and aligned with the figurines, maintaining correct perspective and avoiding skewed angles or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The structure in Image B appears to be architecturally accurate with its columns and arches, and it is designed to be harmonious with the figurines. The overall composition maintains a balanced proportion that respects perspective principles, avoiding any visibly skewed or misaligned aspects. This suggests a precise scaling and a mindful alignment aimed at cohesiveness.",
