      "question": "Are the sunglasses on the horse's face free of unnatural textures and artifacts, maintaining a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse-like figure in the chibi keychain is wearing sunglasses. The sunglasses appear as an integral part of its design, with a smooth and clean finish that is typical for such figurines. Any texture or artifact present conforms to the intentional stylization of the figure. Given the context of a chibi design, this would suggest that the appearance is consistent with its artistic style, implying no unnatural artifacts or textures were introduced.",

      "question": "Does the horse's facial structure maintain structural consistency and visual credibility despite the addition of sunglasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi keychain design from Image B, structural consistency is inherent in its stylized, simplified form. The addition of sunglasses is seamlessly integrated, maintaining the overall roundness and proportionality typical of such designs. The sunglasses fit naturally on the face, showing no distortion or the imposition on the facial structure, aligning with common traits of chibi designs which prioritize cute and exaggerated features.",

      "question": "Are the horse's fur texture and details preserved without any loss or unnatural artifacts introduced by the sunglasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks a realistic fur texture due to its nature as a digitally stylized keychain figure. Instead, it showcases a smooth, simple texture typical of such crafted items. Therefore, no loss of detail is present because the medium doesn't depict realistic horse fur. The sunglasses naturally fit within this aesthetic without introducing any incongruent artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sunglasses' material and reflections appear realistic and consistent with the lighting conditions of the sunset scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses are depicted on a chibi-style horse figure within a diorama. The scene captures a sunset, but given the nature of the object as a toy, the material and reflections are stylized rather than realistic. The lighting on the sunglasses complements the overall crafted look. Given the object type, the representation of material and reflections is consistent with its design intentions rather than photorealistic expectations, fitting stylistically with the scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the horse's eyes visible and undistorted under the sunglasses, preserving their natural shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses completely cover the horse's eyes, which are characteristic of being large and expressive in a chibi style. However, just like the overall design, the sunglasses fit naturally over where the eyes would be positioned, maintaining the structural integrity. The absence of visible eyes fits the design aesthetic rather than being an oversight or distortion.",
