    "Question": "Q1: Do the arm-like appendages formed from the balconies maintain consistent proportions and smooth joints without jagged edges or unnatural bends?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are arm-like appendages extending from the building's balconies. To maintain a realistic transformation, these should follow the architectural lines with consistent proportions similar to mechanical structures. They should also have smooth joints to exhibit flexibility and functionality while avoiding jagged edges or unnatural bends that look digitally altered or unrealistic. Observing Image B shows that while the appendages are integrated well with the building structure, some transitions from the balcony to the appendages do not have completely smooth joints, indicating slight jaggedness or bends. Hence, the appendages do not flawlessly maintain consistent proportions.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the glowing panels uniformly distributed across the window positions and do they emit light in a way that blends seamlessly with the surrounding surfaces without harsh halos or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing panels seem to have been placed over the windows or similar surfaces. For a seamless integration, these panels should be evenly distributed and have a light emission that blends subtly with the building's facade, avoiding harsh halos or pixelation that would suggest poor editing or unrealism. On examining Image B, the glow appears consistent overall, with no evident harsh halos or pixelation. The panels are distributed in a way that follows the building's design, creating a balanced visual appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the circuit patterns run along plausible structural lines (e.g., edges, corners) and exhibit consistent thickness and color without appearing as random overlays or digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Circuit patterns, to be believable, should align with structural elements like edges or corners of the building, maintaining a coherent theme with consistent thickness and color. In Image B, the circuit-like designs extend down the building, following plausible structural lines such as the building's edges and balconies. They exhibit a uniform color and thickness, suggesting a well-integrated appearance rather than random overlays. This adherence to the building's architecture helps avoid the appearance of digital artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the dynamic parts at the edges of the building connected to the main structure through visible mechanical links, and do they follow realistic pivot points without floating or misaligned components?",
    "explanation": "Dynamic parts need to be mechanically integrated into the architecture, typically through visible links or pivot points that suggest motion or attachment. These parts should align with the building design, not floating or appearing misaligned. In Image B, while the appendages at the building's edges display some level of attachment, certain connections lack visible mechanical links, which can suggest floating. Additionally, some parts don't align perfectly with likely pivot points, compromising the realism.",
    "answer": "No"
},
{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the exposed gears positioned at structural junctions and scaled appropriately relative to the building’s height and width, without appearing oversized or misaligned with surrounding features?",
    "explanation": "Exposed gears should be at structural junctions where they could serve a mechanical function, with a size that complements the building scale. In Image B, the gears are strategically placed at key junctions and are scaled to proportionally match the building's dimensions, ensuring they do not seem oversized or out of place. They enhance the building’s mechanical aesthetic without disruptively overshadowing other features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
