    "Question": "Q1: Does the geisha's face retain anatomical accuracy with natural proportions and smooth contours despite the stained glass transformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stained glass effect alters the textures and sharpness of contours, impacting the anatomical accuracy compared to the realistic features seen in stained glass artwork. The face in Image B likely has more geometric and segmented features due to the stained glass style, losing smooth contours and natural proportions.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the patterns on the kimono composed of distinct, sharp segments resembling leaded glass, with no blurred edges or unnatural blending between colors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono's patterns are adapted to a stained glass style, which characterizes distinct, sharp segments of color separated by lines, typical of stained glass art. There is no evidence of blurred edges or unnatural blending, indicating a proper implementation of stained glass technique.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the cherry blossoms exhibit uniform glass-like textures with clear outlines and internal color gradations typical of stained glass, without appearing mushy or pixelated?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms are represented in a stained glass style, with clear outlines and a uniform, glass-like texture. The color gradations are typical of stained glass art, preserving the segmented appearance without mushiness or pixelation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the peacock fan have a logical number of feather segments arranged symmetrically around a central spine, with no overlapping or misaligned parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fanâ€™s segments align symmetrically and logically with the central curve, typical of stained glass portrayal. There is no evident overlapping or misalignment, which suggests that the fan maintains its design integrity within the stained glass transformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the background lines smoothly curved and interconnected without abrupt breaks, gaps, or inconsistent thicknesses that suggest rendering artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, evident is the stained glass style in the geometrically segmented and interconnected background lines. The thickness is consistent and cohesive without rendering artifacts, aligning with the sophisticated stained glass design portrayal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the hand holding the fan display five clearly defined fingers with proper ergonomics and no extra digits or fused joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the artistic stained glass portrayal, the hand holds the fan with five clearly defined fingers without extra digits or fused joints, maintaining proper ergonomics within the stained glass transformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
