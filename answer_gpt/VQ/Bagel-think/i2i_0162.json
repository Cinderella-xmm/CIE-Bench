      "question": "Does the mouse's fur texture appear smooth and maintain the natural look expected in a Pixar-style animation without unnatural or overly simplified patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse features a stylized fur texture that aligns with the Pixar animation style, which often emphasizes smoothness and a simplified yet detailed pattern to look appealing. The fur is represented with a level of detail that fits the aesthetic of animated films, without becoming overly complex or too simplistic. The coloring is consistent and matches the mouse's natural pattern, ensuring a balance that is characteristic of Pixar animations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mouse's ears, eyes, and whiskers proportionally correct and not distorted relative to its body size in the Pixar animation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse's ears, eyes, and whiskers are exaggerated in size compared to its body, which is typical for stylized animation, particularly in the Pixar style. The large eyes and ears are consistent with creating an expressive and cute character, which is a common trait in animations meant to appeal to a broad audience. Therefore, their proportions are intentionally exaggerated rather than distorted, maintaining the intended visual appeal.",

      "question": "Do the soft shadows under the mouse and surrounding crumbs appear naturally integrated into the scene without any harsh or misplaced artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents soft shadows under the mouse and the crumbs, which match the imagined light source in the scene. The shadows are neither harsh nor misplaced, and they complement the warm lighting and the floor’s texture, helping to root the mouse and crumbs naturally within the scene. This is typical of the Pixar style, where attention to detail in lighting enhances realism in stylized settings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the floor's texture retain sufficient detail and pattern authenticity in the Pixar animation style, avoiding unnatural smoothing or artificial patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor maintains a stylized texture that shows enough detail to hint at realism while keeping with the smooth, less complicated patterns common in Pixar animations. The tiles' outlines are visible, yet the overall floor design doesn't appear overly smoothed or vaguely artificial, respecting the balance between realism and animation aesthetics.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crumbs' sizes and shapes consistent and believable within the context of the image, without displaying any unnatural irregularities or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts crumbs that are relatively uniform in size and shape, which is consistent with the style of animation scenes, where elements are cleanly defined yet variable enough to suggest natural randomness. The crumbs fit into the imagined quirkiness of the scenario, avoiding any irregular distortions that could break the scene’s suspension of disbelief.",
