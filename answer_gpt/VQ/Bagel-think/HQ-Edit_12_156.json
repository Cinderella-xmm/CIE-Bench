      "question": "Are the enchanted vines covering the Eiffel Tower's lattice continuous and aligned with its original structural lines, without jagged edges or inconsistent thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is modified with vines growing around its structure. These vines appear to follow the lattice design smoothly, wrapping around the structural lines of the tower without any abrupt edges or changes in thickness. The vines are designed to naturally integrate with the tower’s frame, maintaining the overall aesthetic and architectural continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glowing floral motifs emit light uniformly and cast soft glows that match the ambient lighting from the sunset, without abrupt brightness spikes or disconnected highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing floral motifs in Image B are dispersed across the tower, and they emit a soft, even light that harmonizes with the sunset's warm glow in the background. There are no noticeable abrupt changes in brightness, and the motifs blend seamlessly into the ambient lighting, enhancing the mystical atmosphere without overpowering it.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ancient stone platform at the base of the tower proportionally scaled to the tower's legs and positioned symmetrically, without visible warping or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stone platform visible in Image B at the base of the tower appears suitably scaled and is symmetrically positioned between the legs of the tower. The platform aligns well with the tower's base structure, showing no signs of distortion or uneven alignment, suggesting careful consideration of spatial proportions in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the arcane symbols on the stone platform evenly spaced, properly oriented, and rendered with depth and shadowing that suggest they are carved into the stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arcane symbols on the stone platform are evenly distributed and oriented correctly, with appropriate use of shading and depth. These visual effects give the impression that the symbols are engraved into the platform, contributing to the ancient and magical aesthetic of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the swirling nebulae in the sky flow smoothly from the tower’s base upward, blending with the orange gradient without sharp edges or disconnected patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nebulae in the sky extend from the base of the tower upwards, merging seamlessly with the sunset’s gradient. The transition between the nebulae and the orange sky is smooth, without jagged edges or sections where the colors seem disjointed, creating a harmonious and surreal visual effect.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the crystal pinnacle at the top of the tower have distinct, reflective facets that catch the sunlight and show subtle refractions, without appearing blurry or geometrically distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal pinnacle in Image B is designed with clear, defined facets that reflect the sunlight effectively. These facets exhibit subtle refractions, adding to the jewel-like quality of the pinnacle. The crystal maintains sharp geometric integrity without any signs of blurriness or warping, enhancing the scene's magical atmosphere.",
