    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges and contours of the LEGO car body aligned with the original vehicle’s shape, with no visible gaps, overlapping blocks, or warped sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a LEGO model of a police car, characterized by its block-like design which naturally creates a more angular and less streamlined shape than the actual car depicted in Image A. However, the edges and contours fall within the boundaries of the typical LEGO construction, which is inherently more geometric and segmented. There are no visible gaps, overlapping blocks, or distortions unusual for LEGO builds, maintaining an overall faithful representation of the car's shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red and blue translucent LEGO pieces positioned exactly where the original emergency lights were, and do they appear transparent rather than solid or discolored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO build includes small red and blue blocks on top of the car that correspond to the emergency lights. These pieces are placed in the correct positions similar to where the lights are on the actual police car in Image A. However, typically LEGO pieces of this type are not translucent, rather they are solid in color, so they do not exactly replicate transparency, although they are in the correct location.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the window areas of the LEGO car consist of solid beige bricks without any transparent or see-through elements, making them visually inconsistent with real-world windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO representation in Image B uses light blue transparent bricks to depict windows, consistent with typical LEGO design language for creating a semblance of glass. The windows are not made of solid beige bricks, which means they maintain the visual consistency expected for real-world windows. This matches the expectation of transparency as seen in a real vehicle and differs from the question’s description.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the grille and wheel components built from small LEGO blocks that maintain the original patterns and shapes, with no missing, misaligned, or distorted pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the grille and wheel areas constructed using smaller LEGO pieces, with the grille having a grid-like appearance akin to the police car in Image A. The wheels are circular in shape, fitting the typical LEGO wheel construct. There are no evident missing, misaligned, or distorted parts, sustaining the integrity of the car's basic patterns and shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO car resting on a flat, uniform matte gray surface with no visible seams, texture mismatches, or lighting inconsistencies compared to the car’s shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO car is positioned on a surface that appears uniform and matte gray. There are no apparent seams or texture discrepancies. The shadow of the car on the surface is consistent with the lighting's direction and intensity, maintaining coherence with the rest of the scene.",
