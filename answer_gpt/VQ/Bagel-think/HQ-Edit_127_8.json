    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the stone towers, archway, and knight proportionally scaled and positioned correctly within the glass orb without geometric distortion or unnatural perspective shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stone towers, archway, and knight appear well-scaled within the glass orb, maintaining correct proportionality and positioning that matches a natural perspective. The orb encloses the scene without causing distortion, as the knight and towers fit uniformly within its space.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the stone textures on the towers and gate retain fine detail and natural variation after being minified, without appearing overly smooth or pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stone textures on the towers and gate maintain their detail and exhibit natural variation despite their smaller size within the glass orb. The textures do not appear smooth or pixelated, indicating that their intricate design has been preserved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the antique bronze finish applied uniformly to the knightâ€™s armor and the gate, with realistic tarnish, reflections, and surface depth that match physical metal properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The antique bronze finish on the knight's armor and gate has a realistic appearance, with tarnish, reflections, and depth characteristic of metal surfaces. The finish looks uniform, enhancing the authenticity of the metal properties in the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the heraldic flags positioned correctly on the battlements, with natural folds and orientation suggesting movement in wind, and no clipping or floating artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The heraldic flags on the battlements demonstrate natural folds and orientation, suggesting movement in the wind. Their placement is free from clipping or floating artifacts, indicating a careful attention to detail in their rendering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the tiny turrets and crenellated walls around the base of the orb evenly spaced, geometrically accurate, and stylistically consistent with the main castle structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tiny turrets and crenellated walls around the base of the orb are evenly spaced and geometrically accurate, matching the style of the main castle structure. This consistency ensures a cohesive visual representation within the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the golden rays integrated into the glass surface with proper refraction and depth, creating a seamless illusion of light emanating from within the orb without visible layering or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden rays within the orb are integrated with proper refraction and depth, creating a seamless illusion of illumination emanating from the orb. There are no visible layering or edge artifacts, signifying smooth integration of light effects.",
