    "Question": "Q1: Does the facial area exhibit a consistent dark wood texture with natural grain patterns, maintaining accurate facial proportions and avoiding distortions such as warped features or inconsistent surface depth?",
    "explanation": "For Q1, the facial area is blurred, so it's not possible to evaluate the wood texture, proportions, or distortions accurately. Therefore, the question cannot be answered as intended.",
    "answer": "No"
},
{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the patterns on the clothing rendered as deeply incised carvings with visible relief depth, and do they preserve the original arrangement of colors and shapes without blurring or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the patterns on the clothing appear as deeply incised carvings with distinct relief depth. The colors and shapes are preserved accurately compared to the original design, maintaining the arrangement of complex patterns and vibrant colors without blurring or misalignment. This showcases the artist's detailed attention to replicating the clothing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the beads on the crown and earrings clearly defined with vibrant, non-blended colors, appearing as painted details on the wooden surface rather than merged or distorted textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the beads on the crown and earrings are clearly defined, exhibiting vibrant colors that stand out as painted details on the wooden surface. These elements are rendered without blending or distorting, maintaining their distinct appearance and individual detailing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background composed of low-relief carved plant forms that maintain spatial depth and botanical structure, without flattening or losing the sense of layered vegetation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not consist of any carved structure as visible in the original Image A. The focus in Image B is centralized on the figure, and the background has been removed entirely. Therefore, the background does not meet the criteria of low-relief carvings maintaining spatial depth.",
    "answer": "No"
},
{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the entire sculpture surface display a consistent polished finish with no visible rendering artifacts, such as edge halos, texture repetition, or missing fine details in the hair, beads, or clothing carvings?",
    "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B shows a consistent polished wood texture across its surface. Close examination reveals no visible rendering artifacts like edge halos or texture repetition. All elements, including the beads, hair, and clothing carvings, retain fine details. This results in a harmonious piece with a well-finished appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
