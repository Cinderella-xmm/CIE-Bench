    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the cabinâ€™s roof, walls, and windows clearly defined and geometrically consistent, even with visible brushstrokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits visible brushstrokes, resulting in a less precise and clear definition of the cabin's architectural elements. The lines and shapes that make up these elements appear less geometrically consistent due to the painterly style, suggesting that the structural clarity has been compromised by the brushwork. This analysis is supported by comparing to typical geometric features, which rely on sharp lines and consistent angles that are not preserved here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surrounding fir trees maintain their vertical orientation and layered foliage structure despite the use of loose brushwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the loose brushwork affects the overall clarity, the general vertical orientation of the fir trees and the layered structure of their foliage are still maintained. The brushwork style adapts to these natural forms without altering their innate shapes drastically.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the smoke rise straight upward from the chimney and gradually blur outward, mimicking natural dispersion in cold air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases smoke that rises in a straight column from the chimney, illustrating a natural upward trajectory typical of smoke behavior in cold atmospheres. The smoke then blurs outward, simulating natural dispersion. This suggests a realistic representation consistent with how smoke behaves when meeting colder air.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the snow covering the roof, ground, and tree branches uniformly distributed and textured in a way that suggests natural accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow in Image B appears less uniformly distributed and lacks the textured detail that would suggest natural accumulation due to the painterly style. The looser brushwork fails to replicate the nuanced layering of snow that typically occurs in nature, leading to a more stylized visual than one representing natural snow coverage.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the illuminated windows and string lights along the eaves softly blended into the scene, without harsh outlines or glowing halos that break the stylistic consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illuminated elements in Image B are not softly blended but rather feature prominent glowing halos that stand out against the painterly brushwork. This harshness disrupts the overall stylistic consistency and contrasts with more authentically blended scenes where lighting transitions smoothly into surrounding areas.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the foreground elements (small trees, fence) appear closer than the midground cabin and background trees, preserving depth and spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B preserves depth and spatial logic through the placement and depiction of foreground, midground, and background elements. The small trees and fence are visually positioned closer relative to the cabin and background trees, demonstrating an understanding of perspective and spatial arrangement.",
