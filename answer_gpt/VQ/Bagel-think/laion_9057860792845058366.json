      "question": "Are the reflections on the robot’s body uniform and physically consistent with a metallic surface, without streaks, over-saturation, or mismatched highlight areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's body exhibits reflections that can be assessed for uniformity and consistency with a metallic surface. A metallic surface typically has smooth and clear reflections without streaks or mismatched highlight areas. Upon inspection, the surface reflections appear consistent and well-rendered, indicating a suitable metallic texture that avoids over-saturation. Therefore, the reflections are physically consistent with what would be expected on a metallic surface.",

      "question": "Is the holographic display on the chest transparent and layered above the surface without warping or clipping into the surrounding armor plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the holographic display on the robot's chest appears to be layered above the surface. A transparent holographic effect should show no signs of warping and should not clip into any surrounding parts of the robot. In this image, the holographic display maintains its clarity and position, ensuring it does not interfere with the armor plates, which confirms its intended portrayal as layered above without distortion.",

      "question": "Are the control icons in the digital interface overlay sharp, readable, and positioned without overlapping key mechanical components such as the shoulders or torso joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the control icons in the digital interface overlay need to be assessed for sharpness, readability, and correct positioning. They are digitally rendered and should avoid overlap with any significant mechanical components. The icons are sharp and sufficiently spaced from the robot's body, without overlapping the shoulders or torso joints, which ensures their readability and functional presence.",

      "question": "Is the smartwatch accessory attached to the forearm without bending or deforming the arm’s structure, and does it have a clean, seamless connection point consistent with magnetic attachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, any smartwatch accessory attached to the forearm of the robot would need to be visibly analyzed for attachment integrity and consistency. A clean attachment with seamless integration typically aligns with magnetic attachment properties. Upon review, Image B does not display a smartwatch accessory on the forearm, thus no assessment of its attachment can be made, indicating the absence of the accessory.",

      "question": "Are the floating tech interface symbols in the background evenly spaced, sharp-edged, and free from jagged outlines or ghosting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases floating tech interface symbols in the background around the robot, whose attributes must be evaluated for spacing, sharpness, and absence of jagged outlines. These symbols are well-rendered, sharp-edged, and evenly spaced without ghosting effects, creating a clear representation that aligns with expectations for digital overlays.",
