    "Question": "Q1: Are the roof, walls, and window frames of the Japanese house replaced with colored glass panels outlined by black lead without distorting the original building’s geometry or introducing misaligned or broken lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Japanese house is depicted using a stained glass style, where black lead outlines are distinct and separate colored glass panels that form the roof, walls, and window frames. The geometry of the building remains intact without any distortion or misalignment. The lead lines are consistently straight and continuous, maintaining the structural integrity of the original design. This technique is characteristic of stained glass art, where each section is clearly defined by leads.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Have the red trees on both sides of the house been converted into symmetrical floral motifs made of red and green glass segments that maintain their original placement and scale without unnatural stretching or fragmentation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the red trees appear as floral motifs composed of red segments, surrounded by green glass that represents the foliage. These motifs retain the original placement on both sides of the house, as seen in Image A. There’s no indication of unnatural stretching or fragmentation; the patterns appear fluid and proportional, characteristic of stained glass artistry.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the red moon represented as a series of concentric gradient circles in stained glass style, with smooth color transitions and no jagged edges or irregularities in its form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the red moon is depicted as a circular stained glass element. However, it doesn’t display concentric gradient circles; instead, the representation resembles a uniform circular design in stained glass without visible gradient transitions. The color is consistent, but the description of concentric circles with smooth gradients does not apply here.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are all structural and decorative lines—such as those framing glass panels, outlining windows, and defining floral motifs—uniform, continuous, and properly aligned without breaks, overlaps, or uneven thickness?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lines used to frame the glass panels and outline the architectural and decorative elements are consistent and uniform. These lines are continuous and properly aligned, characteristic of stained glass work where lead lines are used to connect panels seamlessly. There are no visible breaks, overlaps, or uneven thickness in the lines, which ensures clarity and structural coherence in the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the reflections in the water accurately mirror the stained glass version of the house, red floral trees, and red moon with correct proportions, alignment, and color fidelity, without distortion or blurring?",
    "explanation": "The reflection in the water in Image B mirrors the stained glass version of the house and the red floral motifs accurately in terms of proportion and alignment. The colors appear vibrant and maintain fidelity to the stained glass depiction above. There is no significant distortion or blurring present in the reflection, which is consistent with how reflections would appear in a tranquil water surface in stained glass art.",
    "answer": "Yes"
