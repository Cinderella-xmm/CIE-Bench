      "question": "Are the ivy formations on the hammerhead shaped like symmetrical, watchful eyes with natural leaf arrangement and no visible digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammerhead includes an eye-like design with prominent features that resonate with the concept of 'watchful eyes.' These shapes are not naturally formed by ivy but are digitally added to resemble an eye, complete with an iris and pupil, thus not resembling natural leaf arrangement. There are visible digital details and enhancements that create the eye effect, and these are inconsistent with natural plant formations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss-covered bark texture cover the hammer and anvil uniformly without abrupt color shifts, patchy areas, or synthetic-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface texture of the hammer and anvil is enhanced with a moss-covered, bark-like appearance. Upon inspection, there are abrupt color shifts and synthetic enhancements, including digital glowing effects that overlay the natural texture. These indicate a digitally altered texture rather than a natural or uniform coverage.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the root-like structures beneath the anvil extend downward from the base in a way that mimics real tree roots, with tapering thickness and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows roots descending from the anvil, meant to mimic tree roots. However, these roots appear more as intertwined fibers with uniform thickness and some are seen as floating or disconnected from the base, which does not accurately mimic real tree roots that typically taper and are embedded in the ground or surface.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the emerald runes integrated into the bark surface such that they appear carved in, with subtle glow that blends into the surrounding texture and does not cause bright outlines or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, emerald runes appear prominently on the anvil with bright glowing outlines. These runes are not seamlessly integrated; rather, they stand out with a bright and pronounced glow that causes pixelation and sharp outlines, not blending subtly into the surrounding texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the ivy tendrils follow logical climbing paths from the window frame and floor, wrapping around the hammer and anvil without crossing through solid parts or appearing suspended in mid-air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ivy tendrils are depicted as following logical pathways from the window and floor up to the hammer and anvil. They adhere to the realistic depiction of plant growth, ensuring that they are not crossing through solid parts or floating unnaturally, maintaining a realistic interaction with the objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the transformed anvil and hammer fall consistently with the light source from the window, and do they interact naturally with the wooden table and surrounding tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light comes from the window on the left. The shadows of the anvil and hammer should logically fall towards the right, which they do. However, due to added glowing effects, shadows are not entirely natural as glowing parts seem to disregard the directionality of the light source, but overall, most shadows and interactions on the table are consistent with the main light source.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
