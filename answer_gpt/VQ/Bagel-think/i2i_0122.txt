    "Question": "Q1: Does the outdoor café table appear to have a natural wood texture and color, consistent with the existing glass cups?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the table has a visible wood grain and natural color. The comparison of the wooden pattern in both images suggests that the table's design remains consistent in texture and complements the transparent and smooth appearance of the glass cups. The lighting on the table suggests a natural setting, coherent with the glass cups which reflect ambient light appropriately.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the snowy cabin in the background seamlessly integrated into the scene without noticeable edges or unnatural blending?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snowy cabin appears integrated into the scene with a consistent lighting that matches the overall image. There are no visible edges or signs of artificial insertion. The placement and perspective of the cabin correlate naturally with the foreground elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the reflections and shadows on the glasses match the lighting conditions of the new snowy cabin background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glasses reflect a lighting direction that aligns with the sunlit snowy cabin, indicating that the source of the light is consistent. The shadows on the table are consistent with ambient outdoor light, suggesting the reflections and shadows are coherent with the new setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the sizes and proportional relationships between the two glasses and the outdoor café table natural and physically plausible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glasses and the table are proportionally consistent with a realistic setup. The size of the glasses relative to the table and the steam rising naturally fit within a plausible physical context that would be expected in such a scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the steam rising from the glasses look natural and consistent with the new outdoor café setting without any artificial interruptions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the steam rises vertically from the glasses with a natural appearance that doesn't appear artificially altered. The transition from the cups to the steam is smooth, and the volumetric effect of the steam fits well with an outdoor setting where cooler air would enhance visibility of steam.",
    "answer": "Yes"
