      "question": "Does the womanâ€™s face exhibit natural contours and shading without visible unnatural textures or blotches in the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the editing employs a watercolor style that often smoothens textures and adds a more artistic touch with broader strokes. The contours and shading on the woman's face appear to maintain general facial structure despite the abstract watercolor style, which naturally simplifies details. As a common practice in watercolor, the absence of pronounced textures like blotches aligns with maintaining an aesthetic appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the background figures appropriately simplified with light lines and washes, avoiding unnatural geometric breaks or inconsistencies in their form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, the background figures are transformed with a watercolor effect. The style uses broad strokes and softened edges, which traditionally results in lighter lines and washes. The forms of the figures remain connected and exhibit a fluid transition between the clothing and bodies without evident unnatural breaks or geometric inconsistencies. This reflects the typical manner in which watercolor simplifies complex detail while preserving overall figure identity.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the woman's hand holding the wine glass composed of five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, avoiding unnatural artifacts or shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hand holding the wine glass retains the five fingers, and the application of watercolor smoothens the hand's details, emphasizing the gesture rather than the intricacy of each finger. This style captures the natural curvature and spacing, without introducing awkward artifacts or distortion. Maintaining anatomical proportion is common in artistic abstraction to preserve recognizability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wine glass appear transparent with subtle reflections, consistent with its real-life properties, without losing fine details or becoming overly stylized in the watercolor transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the watercolor transformation of Image B, the wine glass maintains transparency with some reflection details, which is a fundamental challenge in depicting glass in a stylized manner. The watercolor effect naturally sacrifices some detail but attempts to capture the essence of transparency and reflection, achieving a balance without making it overly abstract or stylized beyond recognition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and interactions between the woman, her glass, and the table appear consistent with lighting and spatial positioning, avoiding any visual distortion or floating effects after the watercolor transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the watercolor style does alter the appearance, shadows, and spatial interactions remain logical. The positioning of the woman, her hand, and the wine glass relative to the table looks proportionate, creating a coherent interaction with ambient light effects. Watercolor effects often blur strict edges, but the perception of space in this transformation is maintained without producing floating effects or significant visual distortion.",
