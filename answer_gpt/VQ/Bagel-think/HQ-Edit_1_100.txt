    "Question": "Q1: Does the characterâ€™s face retain natural proportions and smooth contours despite the half-cartoon style transformation, without visible distortion in facial structure?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the face is depicted in a half-cartoon style. Cartoon styles often aim to exaggerate features for effect while still maintaining a semblance of human proportions. Given this artistic transformation, the face maintains proportional features like proper alignment of ears, nose, and mouth, keeping smooth contours typical in cartoons to ensure an appealing depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the sleeves exhibit natural fabric draping with consistent lighting, shadow depth, and fold patterns that align with gravity and textile behavior?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the sleeves are illustrated with a smooth draping effect typical of natural fabric. The lighting is even, casting consistent shadow depth, and the folds conform to gravity, reflecting realistic textile behavior.",
    "answer": "Yes"
