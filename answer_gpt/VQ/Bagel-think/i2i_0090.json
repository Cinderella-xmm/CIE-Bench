      "question": "Do the edges and contours of the stapler maintain their smoothness without any jagged or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both staplers are examined for their contours. The edges appear consistent and smooth, typical of a well-designed office stapler. The contours flow naturally without any visible breaks or jagged lines, suggesting a digitally rendered or well-photographed real object. World knowledge on product design indicates that staplers generally have smooth curves for ergonomic and aesthetic reasons.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blue color and metallic finish of the stapler consistent across both the front and back views with no visible texture discrepancies or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B reveals that the color and finish of both staplers are uniform. The blue color is consistent, with the metallic components also displaying a similar finish in both the front and back views of the staplers. There are no noticeable discrepancies or texture artifacts, reflecting consistent manufacturing quality, which is common knowledge in product manufacturing.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the mechanical components such as screws and hinges depicted accurately and consistently between the two views, avoiding any illogical positioning or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the screws and hinges appear logically placed and are consistent between the two views of the staplers. The mechanical components align with how they would typically be positioned on a real stapler, maintaining accuracy and avoiding distortions. Common knowledge about the functionality of staplers supports these observations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the stapler match the lighting conditions in both views, ensuring a believable three-dimensional effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows and highlights are consistent with the light source and provide a realistic three-dimensional appearance of the staplers. The reflections and shading are coherent, enhancing the realistic portrayal of the objects. This is aligned with common practices in photography and CGI to maintain lighting consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the layout of the stapler's side-by-side views clear and uncluttered, with no distracting or misplaced elements disrupting the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The side-by-side comparison in Image B is neatly arranged, showing both staplers clearly without any extraneous elements. The setup is clean and focused solely on the staplers, facilitating a straightforward visual assessment. Common design principles favor such clear arrangements for clarity and analysis.",
