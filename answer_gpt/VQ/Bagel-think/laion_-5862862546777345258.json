      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the church's façade maintain its original architectural shape and symmetry when rendered in porcelain, with no distorted columns, misaligned arches, or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church has been recreated in a miniature or model-like form. Despite being stylized, the architectural integrity appears intact with symmetrical columns and arches, and the edges are not broken. This reflects a careful attention to detail that mirrors the original structure in its iconic form.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all human figures replaced with pewter models that have anatomically correct hands with no more than five fingers, and do they maintain natural postures without joint bending or limb distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures are stylized and simplified. They mimic basic human posture and structure with no visible distortion or anatomical inaccuracies such as more than five fingers. The figures remain upright and exhibit natural postures relative to the miniature setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the baroque-style dome fully enclosing the scene without gaps, overlapping incorrectly with the church or ground, or showing seams or incomplete surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dome in Image B is portrayed without visible gaps or incorrect overlaps. It sits neatly on the structure and is seamlessly integrated with the rest of the church model, following the architectural design of Image A without visible incomplete surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the glass trees retain natural branch structures and show transparent, refractive qualities without jagged outlines or unnatural coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are not depicted as glass but rather as solid, stylized forms typical in miniature settings. They do not display natural glass-like properties such as transparency or refraction, rather they are modeled as solid objects with a consistent, non-refractive color.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the café tables and umbrellas scaled down appropriately with intact shapes—specifically, do the umbrella canopies remain circular and the table legs remain straight and evenly spaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the café tables and their structures are transformed into a miniature form. Evidence from visual cues suggests the tables maintain their shapes with straight legs, while umbrellas are not depicted in a circular canopy form, reflecting a deliberate artistic choice that adheres to the design constraints of the model.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the antique marble base display consistent veining patterns and appropriate thickness, and is it positioned directly beneath the scene without floating or clipping errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marble base in Image B is styled to mimic an antique marble appearance with consistent veining patterns. It supports the entire model directly and does not exhibit floating or clipping issues, which aligns with realistic bases found in display models.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
