    "Question": "Q1: Are the brass gears and levers on the desk properly aligned with the desk’s structure, showing no signs of floating, misshapen geometry, or unnatural material seams?",
    "explanation": "The edited image displays intricate brass gears and levers within the desk structure. Assessing these elements involves examining their placement and alignment with the desk, ensuring they seem naturally integrated rather than floating or exhibiting misshapen geometry. The gears appear well-fitted within the ornate patterns of the desk, without noticeable seams or unnatural alignment. Therefore, the visual cues combined with common knowledge of mechanical components suggest proper integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the modified books display consistent glowing effects without distorting their page edges or causing unnatural light bleeding into surrounding surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the books on the desk and floor emit a blue glow, presumably from the holographic globe influence. This glow must manifest consistently along the book surfaces without causing distortion to the edges or excessive light bleeding that disrupts surrounding areas. The glow appears evenly distributed across the books, maintaining their structural edges and not causing lighting discrepancies or bleeding into adjacent surfaces. Thus, they exhibit consistent glowing effects based on the visual analysis.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the holographic globe above the monitor clearly visible with proper depth and transparency, and does it cast natural shadows or reflections on the desk surface?",
    "explanation": "The holographic globe is visually distinct atop the monitor in the edited image, showing clear transparency and depth. Evaluating proper hologram design involves observing its transparency, lighting interaction, and realistic projection of shadows or reflections, suggesting spatial presence. Although the hologram's lighting is clear, it lacks apparent shadow or reflection interaction with the desk surface, indicating room for improved realism in depth and shadow rendering.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the newly added ornate frames around the windows seamlessly integrated with the existing window structure, without overlapping glass panes or creating distorted perspective lines?",
    "explanation": "The window structures are embellished with ornate frames in the edited image. Proper integration of these frames requires careful alignment with existing window structures—preserving perspective continuity and avoiding overlap issues with glass panes. The frames in the edited image fit well, maintaining perspective integrity without distorting or clashing with glass surfaces. The perspectives of both frames and windowpanes remain coherent and integrated based on visual and spatial logic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do all edited elements (gears, glowing books, hologram, window frames) share consistent lighting and shadow behavior, avoiding abrupt changes in brightness or material properties?",
    "explanation": "Evaluating lighting and shadow consistency involves examining if the edited elements like gears, books, hologram, and frames share uniform brightness, shadows, and material properties. The edited image shows distinct lighting for each feature without abrupt brightness changes or material inconsistencies. The gears and frames maintain the room's lighting and shadow patterns, while glowing books and the hologram, though bright, avoid disrupting the setting's lighting harmony.",
    "answer": "Yes"
