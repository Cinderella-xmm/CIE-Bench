      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the bold outlines precisely trace the edges of the player, basketball, hoop, and court without overlapping or cutting into the underlying forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features bold outlines characteristic of comic-style rendering. To determine if these outlines precisely trace the edges: observe the player's body, basketball, hoop, and court lines. The outlines wrap around these forms without encroaching on the surfaces, indicating precision in the editing. Comparing with the usual non-comic style, outlines do not extend into the shapes but follow contours closely.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dynamic action lines positioned along the direction of motion and do they avoid intersecting solid objects like the playerâ€™s body or the basketball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Dynamic action lines in comics denote speed and motion direction. In the edited image, the absence or presence of such lines around the player's arm or basketball can be analyzed for placement. Commonly, these lines do not intersect solid shapes like a player's body, maintaining focus on speed depiction. Here, they are affirmatively placed along apparent motion lines outside the player's limbs or basketball area.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red and orange hues applied consistently across the image without causing visible color bleeding, banding, or loss of detail in areas such as the jersey fabric, skin tone, or wooden floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The comic rendering applies distinct color zones, primarily reds and oranges. Observing carefully, the jersey, skin, and floor show application consistency, with no overlapping, bleeding, or disintegrated details. Banding or texture loss is avoided, retaining fabric folds, skin tone depth, and wood grain. Typically comics use defined color segments maintaining clarity without bleeding.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text overlay clearly legible, positioned outside the main subject area, and not covering any essential part of the player or basketball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'PARE SE ETLIN' and 'SMEL BLUZLE' is examined for placement away from key visual areas, i.e., the player's body and basketball, ensuring focus retention. Standard comic layout positions text separately from main action zones. Its legibility without obscuring critical visual elements denotes clear positioning, achieved by assessing overlay against the main subject.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the comic panel border evenly drawn around the entire image, maintaining consistent thickness and not cropping any part of the player, hoop, or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comic panel frames typically create enclosure without intruding on or cropping main image elements. Assessing border placement in the image, ensures it surrounds uniformly without altering player or hoop coverage. Balanced line consistency keeps the panel intact without clipping, common in comics ensuring neat frame lines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the basketball have exactly five fingers, correctly proportioned and naturally curved around the ball, with no extra digits or unnatural gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand's configuration is examined for correct anatomy, characteristic of natural grip on balls. Five-digit count and curvature parallel typical basketball holding. Comic adaptation often highlights hand contours, and this image observes appropriate detailing without erroneous digits or finger gaps.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the basketball fully spherical with visible seam lines and no flattened or distorted regions despite the comic-style rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comic style, spheres like basketballs retain shape accuracy to maintain realism within illustrative form. Evaluating the basketball: visible seam lines imply realistic structure; absence of distortion holds rotational sphere representation despite stylization. Sphere accuracy parallels the original depiction closely within the comic limits.",
