      "question": "Are the guitar and microphone depicted in a chibi-style 3D design while maintaining their original shapes and proportions?",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar and microphone are transformed into a chibi-style 3D design, evident by the exaggerated features like larger, rounded edges, and cartoonish characteristics typical of the chibi art style. However, they still maintain their basic identifiable shapes of a guitar and a microphone, keeping their original proportions recognizable. This transformation aligns with the characteristics of chibi style, which involves a playful and exaggerated form while retaining the essence of the object.",
