      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the birdâ€™s body maintain accurate proportions and feather structure, with no distorted limbs, misplaced joints, or exaggerated features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird looks to be accurately proportioned with natural feather structure. The details of its body, including the wings, tail, and head, appear consistent with real bird anatomy, and there are no signs of distortion or exaggeration that would indicate errors in proportions or feature placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass dome transparent with smooth surfaces, showing consistent reflections and refractions without visible seams, distortions, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a glass dome encasing the bird and decorative elements, which appears transparent and smooth. The reflections and refractions within the dome are consistent, maintaining a realistic look without visible seams or distortions that would suggest a break in realism.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wooden perch textured with realistic grain and positioned securely under the bird, with no gaps or floating sections suggesting instability?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden perch appears to have a realistic grain texture, resembling natural wood. It supports the tree stump on which the bird is perched. The positioning looks secure, with no visual indications of the stump floating or having gaps implying instability.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the ivy vines curve naturally upward along the structure, with leaves spaced appropriately and no overlapping or clipping through the glass dome or bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ivy vines appear to curve naturally upward along the interior of the dome, with appropriately spaced leaves. There is no visible overlapping or clipping through the glass or the bird, maintaining a realistic and sensible arrangement of elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crafted leaves and tree stump proportionally small compared to the bird, with visible texture details and positioned on the moss-covered base without appearing out of place or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crafted elements in Image B, including leaves and the tree stump, are proportionally smaller than the bird, enhancing the diorama effect. Their textures and details are visible, and they are positioned on the moss-covered base, aligning naturally with the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the moss-covered base show variation in color and texture, resembling real organic growth, with no sharp edges or uniformity suggesting digital pasting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a moss-covered base with varied color and texture, mimicking the look of natural organic growth. There are no sharp edges or uniform patches that would hint at a digital pasting technique, preserving realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are shadows cast by the bird, perch, and dome consistent with the light source in the upper right, with soft gradients and no mismatched highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting effects in Image B, particularly shadows cast by the bird, perch, and dome, align with the light source depicted in the upper right. These shadows display soft gradients consistent with natural lighting, avoiding mismatched highlights that could disrupt the realism.",
