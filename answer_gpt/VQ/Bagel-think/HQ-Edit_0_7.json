    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style parrot maintain smooth feather textures and proportional body parts without visible warping or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style parrot is highly stylized, with exaggerated features such as large eyes, yet the feathers and body parts appear smooth and proportionate. There are no signs of warping or pixelation. This is consistent with typical chibi design aesthetics which prioritize smooth lines and clear textures.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the oversized leaves around the branch proportionally larger than surrounding foliage without appearing stretched or unnaturally shaped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves surrounding the branch are indeed large in relation to the small figure and parrot. However, they maintain a natural shape similar to typical leaf proportions with smooth edges, and do not appear stretched or distorted. This suggests an intentional design choice rather than an error in proportion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the crystal beads on the leaves appear as clear, spherical droplets with subtle reflections and no visible digital artifacts or smudging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal beads in Image B are depicted as spherical droplets with reflections that suggest transparency and clarity. They do not exhibit digital artifacts or smudging, which indicates attention to detail in their rendering to achieve a realistic appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the explorer positioned on a separate branch at a believable distance and scale, with correct limb orientation and no distortion in form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explorer is positioned next to the chibi parrot within the same enclosed glass dome setting, at a scale that is proportionate for a miniature scene. The limbs of the explorer are oriented correctly with no visible distortion, maintaining consistency in presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base of the glass dome feature a consistent wood texture with etched tribal patterns that blend naturally into the rainforest setting without sharp edges or lighting inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the glass dome in Image B exhibits a wood texture with etched tribal patterns. The textures are consistent and do not have sharp edges or lighting inconsistencies, which ensures the base blends naturally into the overall design of the miniaturized rainforest setting.",
