    "Question": "Q1: Are the muscle proportions of the player in red (player #24) exaggerated but still anatomically plausible without visible distortion or unnatural bulging?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the player in red has exaggerated muscles that are presented in a stylized manner, common in artistic renditions of athletes. Muscles appear larger and more defined, yet each muscle group is individually discernible and maintains correct anatomical placement. Despite the exaggeration, no visible distortions or unnatural bulgings are evident, keeping within plausible anatomical limits.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the uniform colors of both players retain natural color gradients and material textures despite increased vibrancy, without appearing oversaturated or flat?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the uniforms are more vibrant, giving a heightened sense of intensity. However, the textures such as fabric folds and light reflections are maintained, and the color gradients appear smooth rather than oversaturated. This suggests enhanced vibrancy without the loss of natural appearance or flattening of textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the team logos on both players' helmets and jerseys accurately rendered and properly aligned without deformation or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the team logos sharply and correctly on both helmets and jerseys. They are placed correctly without any signs of distortion or pixelation, indicating careful attention to logo design and placement in the edited image, keeping the logos true to their real-world depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}


{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background behind the players stylistically enhanced but still coherent with the foreground, without sudden distortions or loss of detail in the crowd or field markings?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is presented with stylized enhancement, which is typical in conceptual or promotional imagery. The crowd and field markings are stylized but still coherent, maintaining overall harmony with the foreground. Minimal loss of detail suggests careful editing to preserve scene context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}


{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the limbs and body postures of both players maintain structural consistency with real-world biomechanics, even with exaggerated motion, without broken joints or floating limbs?",
    "explanation": "Image B exhibits body postures for both players that are exaggerated for dramatic effect; however, limbs and joints still maintain proper alignment consistent with human biomechanics. This thoughtful exaggeration is a common artistic approach to convey movement intensity without physical inconsistency, ensuring the depicted action appears plausible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the matte black collector's box with transparent lid visually consistent in material, lighting, and perspective, and does it surround the cards without introducing edge artifacts or lighting mismatches?",
    "explanation": "The collector's box in Image B is rendered with careful attention to consistency in material texture and lighting, showing a realistic matte finish with accurate reflections and shadowing. The placement of cards within the box is without noticeable artifacts or lighting mismatches, indicating a polished integration of all elements in the surrounding context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
