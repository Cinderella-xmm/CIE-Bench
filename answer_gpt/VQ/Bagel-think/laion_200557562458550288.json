      "question": "Are the facial features added over the star motif proportionally aligned and integrated without distorting the star’s shape or creating unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the facial features added over the star motif in Image B reveals a circular face with eyes and an open mouth. These features cover the star completely, altering its original shape. The added graphical elements change the visual balance and original appearance of the star, resulting in unnatural edges and a disfigurement of the star motif. This indicates that the integration of these features affects the original design negatively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the motion lines surrounding the character have smooth, consistent strokes that align with the jersey's design language and do not exhibit pixelation or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motion lines are visually distinct, featuring a bold, swirling design around the jersey. However, upon inspection, these lines do not appear smoothly drafted and seem to have uneven edges and inconsistencies, suggesting pixelation or artifacts not present in the original jersey design language seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all newly added elements (facial features, motion lines, tagline) rendered using only the original jersey’s color scheme (blue, white, red, gray), with no unintended color bleed or mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the newly added elements on Image B shows that the facial features are in black and white, the motion lines predominantly in blue and white, and the tagline features a mix with red. While the initial appearance of these colors may seem consistent with the original jersey scheme from Image A, the tagline presents colors that extend slightly beyond the provided palette with an unintended mismatch in the shade of blue used, indicating a slight variation.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tagline \"Ride Like a Star!\" positioned diagonally in the bottom-left corner without overlapping or obscuring existing text or graphics, and is it clearly readable without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tagline is observed to be positioned in the bottom-left corner. However, the text reads 'Darll rnue the Jmrst,' which is not 'Ride Like a Star!' and appears distorted and difficult to read due to the font style and character spacing. This version does overlap existing graphic elements and text such as 'DALLAS,' modifying clarity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the fabric texture of the jersey, including the repeated \"DALLAS\" pattern and mesh-like sections, remain intact and undistorted even in areas near the added facial features and motion lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the facial features and motion lines cover significant portions of the jersey's surface. They disrupt the visibility and clarity of the texture pattern, particularly the repeated 'DALLAS' text, by obscuring some sections of the pattern, indicating that the texture and mesh-like sections are indeed distorted and less discernible around these newly added elements in comparison to Image A, where they are clearly visible.",
