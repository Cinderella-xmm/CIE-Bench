    "Question": "Q1: Are the stylized seating icons positioned on the grass without overlapping or displacing real people or objects, and do they cast consistent shadows matching the sun's direction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, observing the layout of the icons, they are positioned over the background and do not appear to overlap any existing people or objects. Nonetheless, the icon style and shadows are not visible, suggesting a lack of integration with the real environment. The edited image does not feature human figures in the same way as Image A, so considering typical imagery, consistent shadow effects aren't observable, indicating that any shadows wouldn't match the sun's depiction in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the speech bubble graphics appear above or near walking figures without intersecting limbs or clothing, and are they proportionally sized relative to the human figures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no evident speech bubble graphics present at all. The imagery used in the edited version focuses solely on graphic symbols and pictograms, indicating that no analysis of speech bubbles in proximity to human figures is applicable here.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the camera icon featuring the Eiffel Tower correctly scaled and positioned so that its outline matches the tower's silhouette and does not exhibit distortion or edge artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B prominently displays the Eiffel Tower as a graphic representation within the poster design's context. The silhouette aligns visually with the presented theme but is illustrated rather than through realistic imagery. The design is simplified and stylized, making direct distortion comparison impossible, but the proportionality and absence of clear artifacts in graphic art suggest intentional design, not unintentional error.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the vertical split line align with the center of the pathway and extend consistently from foreground to background without cutting through key structures like the Eiffel Tower or hedges?",
    "explanation": "In the edited Image B, there is no vertical split line apparent. The design centers around graphic aesthetics that abstract away from the realism found in Image A, thus no split through physical landmarks or aligning with pathways exists.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the cool green tones applied uniformly across the image without causing visible color banding, loss of detail in shadows, or unnatural saturation in the sky or leaves?",
    "explanation": "Image B has a complete adaptation into cool green tones as part of a poster-like illustration. The tone is uniformly green, and due to the nature of this stylized form, shadow detail, or traditional photo color saturation aren't applicable. The uniform color choice eliminates traditional concerns like banding or inconsistent saturation for realism, instead maintaining coherent stylistic choices.",
    "answer": "Yes"
