      "question": "Do the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls maintain the vibrant lime-green color and texture from the soccer cleat and tennis ball without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls are observed to have a vibrant lime-green color very similar to the soccer cleat and the tennis ball in Image A. The texture is consistent, and there are no visible signs of unnatural artifacts or discrepancies in coloration and textural portrayal. The seamless continuation of color and texture from Image A shows a cohesive design intent.",

      "question": "Are the shapes and proportions of the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls coherent and free from any distorted or broken geometric forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls have smooth, rounded forms indicative of a stylized design generally seen in Russian nesting dolls. There are no visible distortions or broken geometric forms; the proportions appear balanced and well-formed according to the characteristic chibi style.",

      "question": "Does the positioning of the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls on the sophisticated wooden table appear natural and visually plausible without any obvious misalignment or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls rest on a wooden table, and careful observation shows that they appear grounded and aligned naturally with the table surface. There is no evidence of misalignment, shadow inconsistencies, or floating effects that would suggest an unnatural placement.",

      "question": "Are the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls arranged from largest to smallest in a manner that appears structurally consistent and visually credible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A clear visual analysis of Image B shows the chibi-style nesting dolls are arranged from largest to smallest, maintaining a traditionally recognizable structural order that is visually credible. Each doll is proportional compared to the others, following a logical sequence seen in typical nested doll arrangements.",

      "question": "Does the texture of the sophisticated wooden table and the subtle background complement the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls without introducing unnatural textures or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table displays a natural wooden texture that complements the lime-green color and modern appearance of the nesting dolls. The background is subtle, allowing for a harmonious contrast without introducing any unnatural textures or compromising the detailed depiction of both the dolls and the table.",
