      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks forming the hot dog uniformly shaped, properly aligned, and free of distorted or misshapen pieces that compromise structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog is constructed using LEGO bricks, which are known for their consistent shape and alignment due to their interlocking design. The bricks appear evenly placed and structurally sound, representing a well-organized hot dog without any visible distortions or misaligned pieces. Combining visual cues with the typical characteristics of LEGO bricks suggests that the bricks are uniformly shaped and properly aligned.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the ceramic mosaic bottle feature smooth, non-glass-like surfaces with clearly defined geometric patterns in red, yellow, and tan, without unnatural reflections or transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is constructed from LEGO bricks, resembling a mosaic with defined geometric patterns in various colors. Unlike ceramics, LEGO's plastic material does not exhibit unnatural reflections or transparency typically associated with glass. The surface looks smooth, and the patterns are sharply defined due to the brick arrangement, aligning with typical LEGO characteristics and not ceramic properties.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the LEGO hot dog's length proportionally consistent with the original hot dogâ€™s size relative to the cutting board and nearby objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO hot dog appears approximately the same length as the original hot dog in Image A, relative to the cutting board and other objects. By visually assessing both images and using knowledge about proportions in photographic compositions, the LEGO hot dog's size seems consistent with that of the original hot dog.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the ceramic bottle have a rounded, flowing shape with no sharp angles or blocky geometry that would disrupt visual harmony with the LEGO hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is constructed with LEGO bricks, which inherently have blocky, angular geometry. The surface design features angular shapes and lacks the smooth curves typical of ceramics. The shape contrasts with visual harmony concepts, as the LEGO bottle exhibits sharp angles and blocky appearance rather than rounded, flowing lines.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden base under both the LEGO hot dog and ceramic bottle seamless, with consistent wood grain and color matching the surrounding table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base looks consistent with the table surface in terms of wood grain and color. Both show a uniform texture and hue, suggesting a seamless integration without noticeable disparities. The visual cues and knowledge about typical woodworking and tabletop design lead to the conclusion that the base matches the surrounding surface well.",
