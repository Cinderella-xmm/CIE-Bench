    "Question": "Q1: Do the petal-like feathers on the sparrow’s body exhibit smooth transitions in pink gradient without visible pixelation, banding, or abrupt color shifts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow's body features feathers that resemble petals, which are colored in a pink gradient. By analyzing the edited image, we can note that the gradient is smooth, and there is no visible pixelation or banding. The color transitions are seamless, suggesting that digital image editing was effectively executed to maintain color fluidity across different feather sections.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the blossom patterns on the wings aligned with the natural feather structure and do they avoid overlapping or warping of existing feather edges?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the bird with wings that have been altered to display blossom patterns. The petals do not overlap awkwardly with the edges of the feathers, and they follow the natural structure of the wings. This reflects that the editing maintained alignment with the bird's anatomy, avoiding any distortion or unnatural placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the cascading cherry blossom tail emerge naturally from the base of the original tail and follow a downward flow that matches the bird’s posture without floating or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "The analysis of Image B demonstrates that the bird's tail, modified with a cherry blossom theme, naturally extends from the tail base. The flow of the tail matches the posture of the bird, and the cascading effect appears well-integrated, with no signs of misalignment or floating, effectively using design techniques to blend with the bird's positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the vines around the sparrow’s legs follow natural curvature and thickness proportional to the leg size, without penetrating or distorting the foot structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vines around the sparrow’s legs are crafted to display natural curvature and proportional thickness relative to the legs. They do not penetrate or distort the foot structure, demonstrating thoughtful editing to maintain natural proportions and curvature consistent with real-life vine growth versus digital artistry.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the dewdrop ornaments on the chest positioned realistically on the surface of the feathers and do they reflect light consistently with surrounding lighting conditions?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates dewdrop ornaments on the sparrow's chest. The positioning appears realistic, following the surface contour of the feathers, with reflections that match the ambient lighting conditions present in the image. This suggests awareness of optic properties and light reflection principles in digital design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
