    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head proportionally enlarged without distorting facial features or flattening the curls of the hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head appears proportional to the chibi design, characteristic of exaggerated features without distortion. The curls of the hair are stylized but maintain their form, typical in such representations, without appearing flattened.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black outlines uniformly thick and cleanly separated from internal details such as hair, skin, and armor engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black outlines around the character are consistently thick and delineate the boundaries between different elements like hair, skin, and armor. It's typical for illustrations to have bold outlines for clarity and separation of design details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the armor display consistent glossy reflections and smooth color transitions without pixelation or repeating patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor shows flat colors typical of chibi designs, with minimal gradients or reflections. While glossy reflections and smooth transitions are more common in realistic images, chibi representations often prioritize clear outlines over detailed texture transitions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shoulder pauldrons and chest plate clearly defined with intact edges and symmetrical design, free from geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoulder pauldrons and chest plate are clearly defined and symmetrical, characteristic of chibi designs that maintain geometric integrity. The design is stylized, typical of keychains, but free from distortions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the silver chain attached at a coherent point and composed of uniformly shaped links that appear physically connected to the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the attachment of the silver chain appears logical for a keychain design with uniform links. The chain is shown connected to a point on the character that makes sense in context, consistent with the purpose of a keychain.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the background exhibit a uniform dark texture with no bright reflections or unnatural gradients, consistent with velvet material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a consistent dark texture background, likely intended to represent velvet without bright reflections or gradients. This smooth backdrop is typical for showcasing accessories like keychains where the focus is on the central object rather than the background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
