      "question": "Does the fedora hat sit naturally on the man's head without visible misalignment, unnatural shadows, or clipping artifacts at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the fedora hat appears to sit naturally on the man's head. The hat is well-positioned with no visible misalignment. The shading and shadows around the hat look natural, indicating a good alignment without clipping artifacts. This conclusion follows from the visual cues of how hats typically sit on heads and the smooth transitions between the hat and the adjacent areas.",

      "question": "Is the bowtie positioned correctly under the collar, with natural fabric folds and no floating or distorted edges, and does it match the era-appropriate design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bowtie is positioned correctly under the collar, showing natural fabric folds that are typical of a properly tied bowtie. The edges are not floating or distorted, suggesting a realistic placement and design. The style of the bowtie matches the era of the 1920s, with its clean lines and formal appearance.",

      "question": "Are the wall decorations in the background composed of clear geometric patterns typical of art deco design, with proper alignment and no texture repetition or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features wall decorations with geometric patterns typical of the art deco design known for its symmetry and bold shapes. The patterns are clear and properly aligned, with no evidence of texture repetition or warping, which indicates adherence to the art deco style that was prevalent in the 1920s.",

      "question": "Do the figures in the background wear clothing consistent with 1920s fashion, with correct proportions, no overlapping or missing limbs, and natural fabric draping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing of the figures in the background is consistent with 1920s fashion, characterized by the era-specific styles such as flapper dresses and tailored suits. The figures have correct proportions without overlapping or missing limbs. The fabric appears to drape naturally, aligning with the fashion sense of the period.",

      "question": "Do both hands holding the saxophone have exactly five fingers each, with natural positioning, visible knuckles, and no deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, both hands holding the saxophone have five fingers each. The fingers are naturally positioned with visible knuckles, demonstrating realistic anatomical details without deformation or extra digits. This logical conclusion is derived from observing the anatomical correctness of the hand and finger depiction.",
