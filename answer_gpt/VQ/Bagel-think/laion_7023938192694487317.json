    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the torso appear uniformly scaled and proportionally enlarged without visible warping or stretching of anatomical features such as shoulders, neck, or waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the torso retains the appropriate proportions and alignment with anatomical features like shoulders, neck, and waist, which appear naturally and symmetrically shaped based on reviewing the dimensions relative to typical human proportions. The visual cues show a consistent and smooth expansion without irregularities, suggesting uniform scaling in editing.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the surface of the shirt uniformly matte with no glossy highlights or fabric weave patterns, indicating a polymer-like finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the shirtâ€™s surface as smooth and lacking any detailed fabric weave patterns or varied textures. This surface finish creates an appearance consistent with glossy painting or polymer materials due to the absence of matte texture, and presence of reflected light highlights, which has a polymer-like appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the \"Craft\" logo clearly visible, elevated in appearance, and rendered in bold colors without blurring, misalignment, or clipping at its edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Craft' logo is sharp, clearly defined with bright white lettering that contrasts against the black shirt. There is no evidence of blurriness or edge clipping; the logo remains prominently visible and correctly aligned, indicative of a crisp render without degradation in quality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the base under the figurine composed of clean, straight lines with smooth surfaces and subtle reflective highlights consistent with polished metal, and does it appear physically attached yet separable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's focus is solely on the upper torso without any visible base under the figurine with surfaces suggestive of polished metal reflected highlights consistently found in bases; therefore, no base is discernible in this image, which makes this question non-applicable.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features, including eyes, beard, glasses, and skin texture, preserved without distortion, blurring, or unnatural blending at the junction with the modified torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the analysis explicitly excludes the blurred face portion, no facial features are visible for evaluation. Therefore, it is impossible to ascertain the preservation of facial features or analyze distortion or blending quality in the absence of this information in Image B.",
