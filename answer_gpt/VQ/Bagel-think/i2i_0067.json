      "question": "Do the colorful macarons appear naturally placed on the plate, maintaining its original arrangement and size proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the macarons appear blurred, which makes it challenging to ascertain their arrangement or size proportions clearly. Typically, natural placement involves both visual symmetry and an absence of distortion. Given the blurred nature, size proportions or arrangement are not perspicuous, so this does not indicate a natural placement typically expected in food photography.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the macarons smooth and detailed, without any visible unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blurred area makes it difficult to assess the texture or presence of any unnatural artifacts on the macarons. Normally, smooth and detailed textures are identifiable through visible surface characteristics. In the image, the blurring obstructs this ability, failing to show the clarity standard of detailed texture.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the light gray tablecloth background look natural and consistent, without causing any distortion or conflicting with the macarons and plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tablecloth looks blurred along with the rest of the image, making it difficult to verify its natural appearance and consistency. A natural tablecloth appearance is characterized by clear and consistent patterns devoid of distortion. Here, the blurring compromises this, suggesting a lack of natural appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the colors of the macarons vibrant and properly contrasted against the light gray tablecloth, avoiding any washed-out or overly saturated appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurring in Image B, definitive evaluation of colors and contrast becomes impossible. Typically, vibrant colors stand out distinctly against backgrounds, whereas blurring causes loss of vibrancy and contrast. Therefore, the blurred state suggests colors are not depicted vibrantly or contrasted properly.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the image, including the macarons, plate, and light gray tablecloth, visually credible and aligned with typical food photography standards?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is extensively blurred, affecting the overall composition's credibility. Typical food photography standards include clarity, composition balance, and aesthetic appeal, none of which can be evaluated due to the loss of visual information through blurring.",
