      "question": "Are the textures of the characters' clothing and skin in the relief carving consistent with the style of ancient limestone carvings, without introducing unnatural artifacts?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters appear as if they have been carved into a stone relief. The clothing and skin have been transformed in a way that resembles ancient carvings, often seen in historical artifacts. This is evident in the smooth and rounded edges as well as the uniform texture that suggests the softness of worn stone. The absence of any modern or artificial-looking textures reinforces the impression that this is a coherent imitation of ancient craftsmanship.",
