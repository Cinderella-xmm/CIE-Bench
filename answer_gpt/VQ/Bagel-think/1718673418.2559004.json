      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the mushroom-shaped rooftops proportionally scaled to the buildings and do they display smooth, continuous surfaces without visible seams or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mushroom-shaped rooftops are significantly larger than the buildings below them, implying a whimsical or fantastical design typical in creative illustration. The surface appears to be smooth and consistent, with no visible seams or distorted geometry, suggesting high-quality digital rendering typical of imaginative artworks aimed at creating an otherworldly environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lake surface show a uniform, flowing shimmer effect without pixelated or fragmented patterns, and does it reflect the sky and buildings in a way that appears fluid and continuous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a lake surface; instead, it portrays a fantastical floating island amidst clouds. Thus, the question about the lake is irrelevant to Image B. Based on visual details, the edited image emphasizes vibrant, seamless elements of sky and clouds rather than a traditional lake.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the mountain structures resemble large, intertwined roots with natural branching patterns, and do they maintain smooth transitions from base to tip without abrupt geometric breaks or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are fantastical structures with elements resembling roots, emphasizing a surreal landscape. They transition smoothly without abrupt geometric changes or unnatural color divergences, aligning with whimsical design aesthetics where consistency in shape and color is prioritized to maintain artistic integrity and thematic consistency.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the vines connecting the buildings uniformly textured, properly anchored at both ends, and free of floating segments or unnatural bends that violate plant growth logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases vines or vegetative elements that seem to naturally connect structures, maintaining uniform texture and proper anchoring reflective of realistic growth patterns in a fantastical setting. The visual design ensures flow and connection between buildings without unnatural bends or illogical growth patterns typically found in fantasy art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bridges between buildings have smooth, glowing surfaces with no visible polygonal edges, and are they positioned so that they logically span between architectural supports without floating disconnectedly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridges appear designed with glowing, smooth surfaces that connect buildings logically, bridging spaces effectively within the artistic depiction. They span between structures without signs of floating inconsistently, suggesting coherent design logic in the fantasy setting where structural integrity beside artistic creativity is maintained.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the leaf-shaped airships have organic, vein-like textures and hover above the water at a height consistent with their size, with underlying clouds rendered as soft, pastel-colored masses without sharp outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes airships above clouds rather than water. These airships feature rounded shapes, hovering at logical heights within the fantasy sky scene. The clouds below are indeed soft and pastel-colored without sharp outlines, delivering a harmonious, dreamy background typical of stylized sky environments.",
