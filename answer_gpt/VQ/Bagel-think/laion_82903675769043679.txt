    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed house maintain consistent geometric shapes without jagged edges, overlapping planes, or unnatural fragmentation that disrupts structural integrity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the house is represented using geometric shapes characteristic of a cubist art style. The shapes are arranged in an orderly manner, with no visible jagged edges or overlapping planes that could disrupt the structural consistency of the image. The design maintains a coherent structure, reflective of deliberate artistic abstraction rather than randomness.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the abstract representations of the crowd evenly distributed across their original positions without clustering or floating elements that violate spatial logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the abstract representations of the crowd are distributed similarly to their arrangement in Image A, maintaining proportional spacing without concentrated clusters or elements that seem misplaced. This shows an intentional positioning that retains the spatial logic from the original scene, even within an abstract rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the checkered pattern applied uniformly across the entire grass surface without visible seams, inconsistent spacing, or distortion at edges near sand traps and water?",
    "explanation": "The grass in Image B is depicted using an arrangement of geometric shapes that mimic a checkered pattern, displaying consistency in shape and color distribution. There are no visible seams or distortions near the sand traps and water, which indicates a uniform application of the pattern across the landscape area.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the prismatic shards in the water reflect the house and sky in fragmented but coherent angular segments without ghosting, blurring, or unnatural color separation?",
    "explanation": "Image B incorporates an abstract style where reflections in the water are rendered using angular, prismatic shapes. These shapes convey a fragmented yet coherent representation of the house and sky without signs of blurring or ghosting. The colors remain crisp and distinguishable, ensuring the representation aligns with the abstract nature without becoming disjointed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the vibrant geometric planes on the houseâ€™s facade consistently lit and shaded to match the ambient light direction, avoiding unnatural highlights or shadow mismatches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric planes of the house's facade use vibrant colors and maintain consistent light and shadow placements. The shading across these planes seems to match an assumed light source direction, avoiding abrupt highlights or shadow discontinuities that might contradict ambient lighting, thus maintaining visual coherence in its abstract format.",
    "answer": "Yes"
