    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the explorer hat placed correctly on the sparrow’s head, matching its scale and shape without deforming the feathers or creating unnatural shadows or seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explorer hat sits well on the sparrow’s head, fitting its size proportionately. It does not appear to crush or deform the feathers underneath, nor does it cast strange shadows or display visible seams around the attachment area, which would indicate an improper placement or adjustment. When the sparrow's head shape is taken into account alongside the hat's curvature, the integration appears seamless and natural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the backpack appear attached to the sparrow’s back with proper alignment and proportion, showing no distortion of feathers or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack is positioned correctly on the sparrow's back. It is scaled proportionately to the size of the sparrow and sits with plausible alignment that does not cause distortion in the appearance of the bird’s feathers. The shading around the area where the backpack is mounted appears consistent with the sparrow’s natural shadowing and feather textures, avoiding unnatural changes or distortions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the stylized map elements positioned where the original oak leaves were, maintaining similar shape and spatial relationship to the branch and bird, with no visible seams or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized map elements replace the original oak leaves, reflecting a similar spatial allocation on the bird’s background without visible seams or misalignments relative to the branch and the bird. These elements maintain a coherent spatial relationship and integrate with the image’s style seamlessly, indicating a careful replacement that respects the original layout positions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sparrow’s feathers retain their original fluffiness and layered texture, with consistent warm earthy tones that enhance but do not distort natural feather patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow’s feathers maintain their original fluffiness and layered texture, just as in Image A. The warm earthly tones from Image A are preserved, enhancing the sparrow’s natural appearance without distorting its feather patterns. The integration of elements such as the hat and backpack has been done carefully to ensure that the feather textures and their visual richness are consistent and coherent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title text clearly visible at the top of the image, using a playful font with swirling elements that do not interfere with the bird or background, and free from distortion or blur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title text is introduced at the bottom instead of the top. It uses a playful font with swirling elements that complement the theme and style without obstructing the view of the bird or the background. The text appears clearly visible, free from distortions or blur, showing an intelligent design choice that considers aesthetic harmony.",
