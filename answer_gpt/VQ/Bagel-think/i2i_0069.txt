    "Question": "Q1: Does the holographic projection screen emerge naturally from the phone without disrupting the visual flow of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a holographic projection added to the sandwich. The holographic screen does not align with any visible device like a phone and appears placed arbitrarily within the image without connecting smoothly to a specific point as a phone would. This disconnection disrupts the visual coherence, as there is no logical source or base from which the screen projects naturally.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there any noticeable artifacts or unnatural colors where the holographic screen connects with the phone?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic projection has been added on top of the sandwich. There are visible discrepancies in color matching and blending where the hologram intersects with the sandwich, causing a stark contrast and making the addition look unnatural. The outline and colors do not blend seamlessly with the surrounding elements, revealing the presence of artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the dimensions of the holographic projection screen match the scale of the surrounding objects in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic projection screen covers a substantial portion of the sandwich area. The dimensions do not align well with real-world expectations for holographic projections from devices like phones, which are usually proportional and smaller relative to nearby objects to maintain realism. Thus, the scale seems disproportionate compared to the sandwich.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the overall texture and detail of the sandwich been preserved despite the addition of the holographic screen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the section of the sandwich beneath and around the holographic projection seems less detailed due to the overlay. The addition of the hologram obscures the natural texture of the sandwich, reducing its visual clarity and detail, which affects the image's realism.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the background remain consistent and undistorted by the addition of the holographic projection screen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background surrounding the holographic projection appears mostly consistent, with no significant distortion or interference caused by the introduction of the projection. The rest of the image and background remain intact, with no visible disruption outside the hologram area.",
    "answer": "Yes"
