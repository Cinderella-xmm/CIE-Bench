      "question": "Does the gilded brocade texture on the kneeling figure's robe show consistent metallic sheen and intricate pattern details without unnatural highlights or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brocade texture on the kneeling figure's robe is intended to depict a luxurious and elaborate design. This can be analyzed through the clarity and consistency of the metallic sheen across the fabric. However, subtle elements such as unnatural highlights or repetitive patterns observed in this robe suggest a lack in naturally depicting the fabric's texture, which affects the authenticity and richness of the representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the velvet texture on the standing figure's cloak rendered with natural depth, soft shading, and smooth transitions between folds without abrupt edges or unnatural compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The standing figure’s cloak in Image B displays what is intended to be a velvet texture. Velvet fabrics typically require careful rendering to achieve depth and softness, characterized by smooth transitions between folds. Image B shows abrupt edges and lacks natural compression of fabric, evident in the unnatural folds and shadows that defy authentic velvet texture rendering.",

      "question": "Are the silver swaddling bands wrapped around the infant’s body correctly aligned with anatomical contours and free from gaps, overlaps, or misplaced reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silver swaddling bands in Image B must correctly follow the infant’s anatomical shape for realism. These bands should not have misalignments, gaps, or overlaps, nor display misplaced reflections. Careful observation in Image B shows inconsistencies in how the bands are wrapped, resulting in an unnatural look not conforming to the baby's contours.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the classical columns and divine motifs in the background align with the figures' scale and perspective, showing correct foreshortening and shadow direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features classical columns and divine motifs intended to align with the scene’s perspective and scale. Analyzing these elements reveals an incongruity between the sizing and foreshortening such as incorrect shadow direction, thereby disrupting spatial coherency across the image.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands of the kneeling and standing figures display five fingers each with natural curvature, unbroken lines, and no extra digits or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kneeling and standing figures must exhibit anatomically correct hands with five fingers featuring natural curvature and solidity. However, upon inspection, these hands show distortion and lack consistent line quality, suggesting alterations or inaccuracies in representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the golden halos above both figures complete circles, evenly spaced from the head, and free from deformation or clipping into hair or garments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden halos above the figures in Image B should maintain integral circles aligned with the figures without interruption. While the halos appear to be visually complete circles and spaced properly, minor clipping issues into the garments or hair are evident upon detailed observation, indicating subtle artifacts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the entire scene exhibit a uniform fresco-like texture with subtle brushstroke patterns and muted tones, without visible digital seams or overly sharp contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B aims to portray a fresco-like texture with brushstroke patterns indicative of hand-painted art. The visible digital seams and sharp contrasts disrupt this uniformity, pointing out transitions that fail to uniformly execute the fresco aesthetic desired.",
