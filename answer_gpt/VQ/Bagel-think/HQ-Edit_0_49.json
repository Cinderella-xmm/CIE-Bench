      "question": "Is the teapot proportionally scaled down while maintaining its original shape, surface details, and structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is positioned under a glass dome along with porcelain cups. The teapot retains its ornate design and intricate details, consistent with the original appearance from Image A, yet it is within a different context that suggests some scaling down or rearrangement had occurred to fit new elements around it inside the dome. Despite the altered display setup, the teapot maintains its shape and all surface details, suggesting that proportions were preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the porcelain cups arranged around the base in a balanced, non-overlapping manner, and do they appear to be made of realistic ceramic material with appropriate reflections and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several porcelain cups are evenly distributed around the base of the teapot, neatly organized without any overlap. They exhibit consistent lighting interactions with realistic reflections and shadows, indicating a believable representation of ceramic material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the new engravings on the elevated surface match the existing decorative patterns in style and depth, without appearing pixelated, duplicated, or unnaturally enhanced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no new engravings visible on Image B, as the ornate details on the teapot's surface appear consistent with the ones observed in Image A. The decorative patterns maintain their intricate style, proper depth, and quality without degradation or pixelation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the steam spirals rise smoothly from the teapot’s spout and lid area, exhibiting soft edges, proper translucency, and consistent lighting interaction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any steam spirals rising from the teapot’s spout or lid area. As there is no visual evidence of steam in the image, any evaluation of its quality in terms of edges, translucency, and lighting is not applicable.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the glass dome show accurate light refraction and surface reflections, allowing clear visibility of the teapot and surrounding elements without visual distortion or artificial glare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome covers the teapot and cups, displaying realistic light refraction and surface reflections that provide a clear view of the contents. The visibility is adeptly maintained without noticeable distortion or artificial glare, ensuring the glass dome appears natural.",
