    "Question": "Q1: Does the angel's facial skin retain smooth, consistent texture and natural coloration without artificial halos, pixelation, or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "The facial skin in the edited image B is obscured entirely. Therefore, it's impossible to assess the smoothness, texture, or coloration of the angel's face or check for any pixelation, artificial halos, or highlights. Given this obstruction, we cannot reasonably determine the details of the facial skin texture in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the added ornate garments visually integrated with the figure’s body, showing realistic draping, fold depth, and material consistency without floating or disconnected elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the garments appear to have more vivid coloration and decorative details compared to Image A. The draping, fold depth, and material consistency look cohesive with the figure's body, as the garments are smoothly following the curvature and movements, without appearing to float or be disconnected. The edit successfully incorporates these elements in a manner that appears visually coherent with the overall structure and positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the gold accents on the wings appear as subtle, layered highlights that follow the natural curvature of the feathers without creating sharp, unnatural glares or breaking feather edges?",
    "explanation": "The gold accents on the wings in Image B are integrated as layered highlights that seem to follow the curvature of the feathers naturally. They add depth and visual interest without exhibiting sharp glares or disrupting the smooth lines and edges of the feathers, thereby maintaining a realistic and harmonious appearance consistent with expected feather structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the transition between the angel’s figure and the new celestial background smooth, with consistent lighting direction and no abrupt edges or mismatched depth cues?",
    "explanation": "The transition in Image B from the angel to the celestial background is smooth; the lighting direction and shadows are consistent throughout the image, reinforcing a cohesive visual flow. This integration avoids abrupt edges or depth mismatches, creating an immersive setting that visually aligns with the angel's figure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the hands show five fingers each with natural joint alignment, proper shadowing, and skin texture without swelling, extra digits, or unnatural contours?",
    "explanation": "Both hands in Image B are shown prominently, each with five fingers, exhibiting correct joint alignment and natural contours. The hands maintain sufficient proper shadowing, ensuring realistic depiction without any signs of swelling or additional digits. This suggests the edit preserved anatomical accuracy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
