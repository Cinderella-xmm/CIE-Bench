      "question": "Are the clock faces and architectural details of the tower clearly visible and structurally consistent despite the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock faces and architectural details are stylized consistent with a cartoon approach. The essential elements such as the clock faces, the arches, and the tower's overall shape are faithfully represented. The architectural details are simplified but recognizably maintained, providing clear visibility and structural consistency within the confines of the cartoon aesthetic.",

      "question": "Do the surfaces of the clock tower and surrounding elements retain their natural textures without any noticeable loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the clock tower and surrounding elements do not retain their natural textures due to the cartoon style, which inherently simplifies and smooths out textures. The texture of the brickwork and other material details present in the original image are replaced by solid colors and outlines typical of a cartoon representation, leading to a noticeable loss of detail.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image avoid introducing any unnatural artifacts or distortions in the clock tower and its surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition to a cartoon style does not introduce unnatural artifacts or distortions. The shapes and key elements are redrawn to reflect a cartoon style, which naturally involves bold lines and simplified forms, but it does not introduce elements that are considered artifacts or distortions. Thus, despite the style change, no unnatural artifacts or distortions are introduced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the clock tower and its surroundings logically maintained in the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions and physical relationships of the clock tower in relation to its surroundings are logically maintained. The roundabout, the placement of the tower, and the cars all appear proportionally and spatially coherent with what one would expect, even within a cartoon adaptation. This consistency suggests that the spatial relationships are respected.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the clock tower and its surroundings remain intact and undistorted in the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the geometric shapes are simplified, they remain intact and are not distorted. The tower's rectangular form, the arches below, and the roundabout retain their basic geometric integrity in the cartoon style. The simplification inherent in cartoon art does not alter the fundamental geometric shapes, ensuring they remain intact.",
