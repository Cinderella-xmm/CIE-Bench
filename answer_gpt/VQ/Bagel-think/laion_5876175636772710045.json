      "question": "Does the brocade doublet on the man have consistent texture, visible pattern details, and natural fabric folds that conform to his body shape without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brocade doublet has a detailed and intricate design with visible patterns and embellishments. The texture appears consistent, and the fabric folds naturally around the man's body, suggesting a well-fitting garment. This indicates that the texture and patterns are well-executed and conform to a realistic representation of brocade material. In contrast, Image A shows a less detailed fabric consistent with a real-world setting, but since Image B is a digitally created scene, attention to detail in fabric texture and patterns is more pronounced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the flowing skirt of the womanâ€™s gown composed of layered, translucent fabric with natural ruffles and soft gradients, and do the jeweled accents appear embedded rather than pasted on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's gown displays a flowing skirt with what appears to be intricate layering, creating a sense of movement. The fabric has natural-looking ruffles and gradients, giving it depth and realism. The jeweled accents are integrated seamlessly into the fabric, rather than appearing as external additions. Compared to Image A, where the gown has a different design suitable for a dance performance, the gown in Image B is artistically enriched with digital enhancements for dramatic effect.",

      "question": "Do the marble floor tiles display continuous veining patterns and subtle reflections, and are the chandeliers structurally sound with clear crystal elements and warm light diffusion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the marble floor is depicted with detailed veining patterns and reflections that suggest a polished and high-quality stone surface. The chandeliers are grand and ornate, showcasing clear crystal elements with a warm light that adds to the ambiance of the scene. These features contribute to an opulent and realistic setting. Image A, in contrast, captures a performance setting without these luxurious architectural elements, indicating that Image B is enhanced to present a more elegant and historical context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the dancers soft and directional, consistent with overhead chandeliers, and do they blend smoothly into the surrounding environment without sharp boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows appear soft and are subtly integrated into the surroundings, suggesting diffused lighting from multiple overhead chandeliers. The shadows follow the typical direction shadows would take in a well-lit, harmonious ballroom setting. This reflects careful digital rendering typical in highly stylized scenarios. In Image A, the lighting is more stage-focused, with dramatic contrasts, demonstrating a live performance environment. The integration of soft shadows in Image B contributes to its overall seamless and polished appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do both dancers' hands show five fingers each with natural joint alignment, smooth skin texture, and no overlapping or missing digits at the point of contact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancers' hands are depicted with clarity, each showing five fingers with natural joint alignment and a smooth skin texture. There are no visual errors such as missing digits or unnatural overlap, which often occurs in lesser-quality digital renderings. The attention to detail in correctly modeling human anatomy here enhances the authenticity of the scene. Image A also accurately portrays the dancers' hands, although it is less digitally intensive in detail.",
