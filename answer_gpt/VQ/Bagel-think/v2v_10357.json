      "question": "Are the shapes of the teddy bear and motorcycle still recognizable after being converted to a low-poly 3-D render style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the low-poly 3-D render style simplifies shapes into more geometric forms with flat surfaces and sharp edges. Despite the stylization, the teddy bear retains key features such as its rounded body, limbs, and helmeted head, making it clearly recognizable as a teddy bear. The motorcycle preserves its characteristic parts like the wheels, handlebars, and engine, maintaining its identity even with reduced detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the teddy bear and motorcycle retain their texture details without appearing overly simplified or losing important features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a low-poly 3-D style, which inherently minimizes texture details to emphasize clean shapes and flat colors, leading to a significant reduction in surface details. The teddy bear lacks the fuzzy texture visible in real-world plush toys, and the motorcycle's metallic sheen is simplified. This style omits intricate texture details characteristic of more realistic representations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the teddy bear and motorcycle consistent with their real-world counterparts, avoiding any distortion or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the teddy bear relative to the motorcycle are visually similar to standard real-world objects, suggesting accurate scaling. The bear fits appropriately on the motorcycle, with its limbs positioned on the handlebars and seat, reflecting believable proportions under the low-poly style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the teddy bear appear naturally seated on the motorcycle, maintaining a believable posture and interaction with the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear is positioned on the motorcycle in a way that suggests a realistic interaction. Its arms grip the handlebars, and its legs span the motorcycle's seat, indicating a believable seating posture consistent with a character riding a bike. This suggests thoughtful alignment despite the stylized rendering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the scenic background seamlessly integrated with the low-poly 3-D rendered teddy bear and motorcycle, without any visible artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B serves as a contrasting element to the low-poly foreground objects (the teddy bear and motorcycle). It appears to be of lower detail than the foreground but does not show any apparent artifacts or jarring inconsistencies that disrupt the overall scene. The elements are visually consistent in style, ensuring the integration is coherent despite the different levels of detail.",
