    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the castle icon used for the HOMEPAGE positioned centrally and sized proportionally to fit within the original white rounded rectangle area without overlapping nearby elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the HOMEPAGE section visually centers around a whimsical castle icon that fits within the visually balanced area designated by a light color background. The design makes sure it is not overlapping other elements, showing an intentional and organized placement. Comparing with the original Image A, where a text box identifies the homepage in a central location, the icon in Image B effectively mirrors the position and containment principle of that layout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the connection lines between the HOMEPAGE and main sections (e.g., PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS, ABOUT US) transformed into smooth, winding trails with no broken segments or irregular widths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a clear visual transformation has been applied to the connection lines, turning them into smooth, winding trails that lead through the whimsical landscape. These trails exhibit consistent, fluid paths that echo the illustrative style, without any segmentation issues or variable widths. Image A had direct lines connecting sections, which was more structured. The redesigned lines in Image B maintain structural integrity whilst embracing a playful aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the icon replacing \"PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS\" clearly visible, properly aligned within the orange rounded rectangle, and appropriately scaled so it doesn't extend beyond the border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces text labels with icons that match a playful theme, ensuring each element is appropriately sized within its designated rounded rectangle. For the area representing 'PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS', the icon is discernible, properly centered, and fits within its boundary without overflow. Image A provided a text label within a structured layout, which in Image B translates into a clearly contained icon fitting stably within its area.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the decorative elements (e.g., trees, creatures) placed along the winding trails in gaps between nodes and do they have smooth outlines and consistent coloring without jagged edges or noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Decorative elements such as trees and creatures in Image B are strategically placed along paths between main nodes, filling spaces without interfering with information flow. The illustrations feature smooth outlines and bright, consistent coloring, which are typical of digital art styles aimed at maintaining quality and visual engagement. This differs from Image A, which had no additional decorative elements.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the text in the blue rounded rectangles (e.g., \"News\", \"Events\") use a consistent, bold, child-friendly font that remains fully contained within the bounds of each shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a whimsical font style for text within blue rounded rectangles that is cohesive and child-friendly, staying within the boundaries just as the original content did. The font choice aligns with a playful theme and readability is maintained without issues of truncation or overflow. Image A used standard fonts inside structured shapes, which in Image B transformed into a more creative, yet still orderly presentation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the different levels of the site map (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th) still visually separable based on color coding or size differences, despite the change in style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while a playful thematic redesign took place, the color scheme and size differences hold visual separation for hierarchical levels. With continued adherence to distinct color coding, each level remains distinguishable, reflecting the organizational theme of Image A. Thoughtful color application ensures that despite style changes, the user's ability to perceive map hierarchy is preserved.",
