    "Question": "Q4: Is the title 'The Lost Legacy' positioned at the top of the image in a bold serif font that is clearly legible, proportionally scaled, and seamlessly overlaid without obscuring the ceiling details or causing visual disruption to the surrounding ornate patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the title present at the top of the image reads 'THE TAHE BRICDERS,' which is different from 'The Lost Legacy.'

    "Question": "Q5: Do the added elements—the magnifying glass and the ghostly figure—integrate seamlessly into the scene without distorting adjacent objects, altering lighting logic, or introducing visible artifacts such as misaligned edges or texture repetition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the added ghostly figure seems to integrate well without disrupting the window's pattern, there is no visible magnifying glass placed among the books on the left bookshelf, indicating a lack of integration. The ghostly figure is added without apparent distortion of nearby objects or lighting issues, but the absence of the magnifying glass or its mismatched integration suggests a lack of seamlessness in the combination of elements.",
    "answer": "No"
