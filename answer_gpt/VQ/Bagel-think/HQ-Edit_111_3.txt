    "Question": "Q1: Are the monochrome line-drawings for the antennae, wings, abdomen, and thorax accurately aligned with the actual anatomy of the butterfly and do they follow its natural contours without overlapping incorrectly or creating geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the line drawings are superimposed over the butterfly to highlight its anatomical features. By analyzing the positioning of the lines, they generally seem to follow the natural contours of the butterfly’s body and wings, without evident distortion or overlap that misrepresents its anatomy. The lines appear to be aligned with the structure of the butterfly as would be expected in an educational overlay.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the added pink petals appear seamlessly integrated into the surrounding flora with consistent lighting, texture, and shadow alignment, avoiding any visible seams or artificial edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, no artificial petals are visibly added, as the floral elements appear consistent with natural growth patterns. The petals present match the lighting and textural detail of the rest of the flora, showing no visible seams or edges that suggest artificial addition. The unified lighting and texture integration indicates natural scene consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the text boxes positioned in non-obtrusive areas of the image, clearly readable, and visually balanced so they do not interfere with the butterfly or floral elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text boxes are placed towards the top and bottom of the image, and they do not overlap with the butterfly or petals. The balance of text placement ensures the butterfly, the focal point, remains unobstructed. The text also appears readable against the background, suggesting strategic positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the vibrant blue color of the butterfly’s wings preserved uniformly across all areas, including under and around the overlaid anatomical lines, without any visible discoloration or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings retain their vibrant blue color. The anatomical lines do not obscure or alter the coloration or shading beneath them. Uniformity in color suggests that the overlay maintains the original detail and hue seen on the wings, without any inconsistency or loss.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, pixelation, or unnatural textures in the areas where edits were made (e.g., line drawings, text boxes, added petals)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, close inspection reveals no visible artifacts like jagged lines or pixelation. The anatomical lines and text boxes are smooth, and there are no unnatural textures in the image, indicating the edits were of high quality. Any additions or overlays maintain a cohesive visual presentation.",
    "answer": "No"
