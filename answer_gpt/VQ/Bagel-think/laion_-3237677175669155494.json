      "question": "Do the mechanical sentinels replacing the buses have intact geometric shapes, smooth surfaces, and consistent glowing blue underlights without visible rendering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buses appear to be transformed into futuristic mechanical sentinels with glowing blue elements. The design exhibits intact geometric shapes, as evidenced by the crisp and structured outline of the vehicles. The surfaces appear smooth with well-defined lines, and the blue underlights are consistent, providing a cohesive look throughout the image. There are no rendering artifacts evident in the image, which implies that the mechanical elements are well-integrated into the design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the golden automaton version of Big Ben have uniform metallic texture, proper vertical alignment, and a centrally placed cosmic eye clockface without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Big Ben has been transformed into a golden automaton with noticeable steampunk elements. The structure maintains a uniform metallic texture throughout, giving off a regal, machine-like appearance. The alignment is proper, as both the real and transformed Big Ben towers remain vertical. The clockface, transformed into a cosmic eye, maintains its position and proportions without any noticeable distortion, contributing to the cohesive transformation of the overall structure.",

      "question": "Are the energetic vines wrapped around the Houses of Parliament following plausible growth patterns, maintaining consistent glow, and not intersecting through solid architectural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, energetic vines are seen wrapping around the Big Ben towers rather than the Houses of Parliament, as described in the question. These vines follow plausible growth patterns as their placement respects the contours of the towers, spiraling upwards in a naturalistic manner. The glow from the vines is consistent, adding to the image's vibrant atmosphere. These energetic vines do not appear to intersect through any solid architectural elements of Big Ben, as they settle onto the structures rather than penetrate through them, maintaining a plausible and cohesive look.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the airships in the sky properly scaled, positioned at a reasonable altitude, and displaying iridescent surfaces without harsh edges or shadow mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, numerous airships populate the sky. They are appropriately scaled with respect to one another, displaying a range of sizes that suggest varying distances from the observer. Their altitude is reasonable as they fill the upper half of the scene, and the positioning complements the overall composition without crowding. The surfaces of the airships are iridescent, which is evident from the reflections and light variations. There are no harsh edges or shadow mismatches visible, indicating that the ships are well-integrated into the sky and consistent with the ambient lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements (underlights, cosmic eye, vines, airships) blend with the ambient lighting of the scene without creating overly bright spots or unnatural contrast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several glowing elements are present, such as the underlights on the mechanical sentinels, the cosmic eye on Big Ben, the glowing vines, and elements of the airships. These light sources blend with the existing ambient lighting, as evidenced by the even distribution of light and lack of overly bright hotspots that would indicate unnatural contrast. The scene captures the balance of ambient and artificial light, enhancing the depiction of a futuristic setting during daylight without causing visual disturbances or unrealistic lighting issues.",
