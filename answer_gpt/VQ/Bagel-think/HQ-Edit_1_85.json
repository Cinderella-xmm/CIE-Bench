      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the lace details on the blouse rendered with consistent texture and edge definition, avoiding jagged or artificial-looking patterns that break from realistic fabric behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lace details on the blouse are displayed in a flat, illustrative style typical of a drawing or graphic interpretation rather than realistic fabric rendering. The edges are stylized and uniform, consistent with the overall drawing aesthetic, meaning jagged or unrealistic patterns do not break the coherence of the cartoon-like presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the enlarged violin maintain correct proportions and undistorted structural elements such as the scroll, bridge, and f-holes, without visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin is depicted in a stylized, cartoon manner, matching the aesthetic of drawn or exaggerated proportions typical in illustrations. The scroll, bridge, and f-holes appear consistent and proportional within the stylized context, so there are no distortions or stretching evident within the framework of the design style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fingers on both hands correctly positioned and shaped, with no extra digits or distorted joints, maintaining natural human anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the fingers follows a simplified and stylized format. The fingers are correctly positioned relative to the violin playing action and appear well-proportioned within the illustrative style, without extra digits or distortion of joints that might break from expected human anatomy representation for this artistic type.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the overall surface texture consistent across the image, with no mismatched areas showing sudden changes in lighting, gloss, or material quality that suggest poor layer blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a consistent and stylized cartoon texture throughout, maintaining a uniform graphic appearance without abrupt changes in lighting or gloss that might indicate poor blending. The artistic choice for a flat and uniform texture supports the coherence across the entire image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all foreground elements (girl, violin, table, candlestick) maintain consistent depth and placement, avoiding floating or misplaced components that disrupt spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all foreground elements are placed consistently with an illustrative framework. The depth and layout are typically flat and graphic as is customary with drawn designs, supporting spatial logic without any noticeable misplacement or floating of components as seen in a structured and coherent illustration format.",
