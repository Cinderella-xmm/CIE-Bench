      "question": "Are the color blocks applied across the shirtâ€™s surface uniform and sharply defined, with no visible smudging or blending between adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design features vibrant neon colors, each distinctly separated, creating sharp, defined boundaries between different colored areas. There is a clear contrast between the bright hues, and no blending or smudging is apparent. This stark contrast and precise separation are typical characteristics of digital illustrations using bold colors. This creates a clear and crisp appearance.",

      "question": "Are the limbs and torso of the central figure proportionally accurate, with no exaggerated or broken joint lines that violate physical realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure's limbs and torso maintain proportional accuracy similar to artistic representations of human figures. The depiction follows typical stylized art forms where proportions are exaggerated within a permissible limit for creative effect, without delving into unnatural or distorted representation. The joints seem intact and the anatomy adheres to stylized realism.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is well-aligned within the circular frame, mirroring the original placement in Image A. The bordering geometric shapes maintain their structure and proportion, suggesting careful attention to spatial accuracy and alignment. This indicates adherence to the original framing design.",
