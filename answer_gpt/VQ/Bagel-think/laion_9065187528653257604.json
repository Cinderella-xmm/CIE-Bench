      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the neon accents added to the motorcycleâ€™s body emitting a consistent, smooth glow without harsh edges or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle features neon accents that should emit a soft and consistent glow. A detailed inspection of the neon elements shows a smooth and uniform glow around the motorcycle's body, which is typical of digital enhancements commonly used in futuristic designs to achieve a sleek look. This effect is achieved without visible pixelation or harsh edges, indicating high-quality editing. Therefore, the neon accents appear well-integrated and characteristic of refined digital artwork.",

      "question": "Do the hover wheels maintain symmetrical, closed geometric forms without visible deformation or broken spokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hover wheels of the motorcycle are designed to exhibit futuristic features, replacing traditional motorcycle wheels with glowing, geometric representations. Close examination reveals that these hover wheels maintain symmetry and a consistent form, without any deformation or broken spokes; the design ensures that the wheels appear as closed, complete circular structures. This aligns with the artistic choice for futuristic and advanced engineering concepts in digital depictions.",

      "question": "Is the digital interface seamlessly embedded in the front panel without intersecting or obscuring existing elements like the headlight or mirrors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a digital interface on the left of the isometric box which does not overlap or interfere with the motorcycle elements such as the headlight or mirrors. The placement ensures that the interface is distinctly separated from the motorcycle components, maintaining clarity and preventing obstruction. This reflects a carefully considered design layout typical of effective digital renderings.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the isometric box exhibit uniform edge lengths and correct angles, with no skewed faces or misaligned corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is enclosed within an isometric box, evident in its geometric alignment. The edges appear even and the angles correct, indicating that the box is visually balanced with aligned corners, a common characteristic of isometric perspectives in digital art. This consistency helps in maintaining the stylish and organized look often sought in modern design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transparent window free of warping, chromatic aberration, or ghosting that would distort the view of the motorcycle behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transparent window in Image B is a significant part of showcasing the motorcycle without distortion. Upon inspection, the window covering the motorcycle displays clarity with no signs of chromatic aberration or ghosting, which means the image is preserved in integrity with no visual distortion. This reliable clarity is often aimed for in high-quality visual presentations to ensure the attractiveness of the depicted object is unhindered.",
