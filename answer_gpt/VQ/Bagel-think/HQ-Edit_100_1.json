    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the tree in the edited image maintain natural branch proportions and trunk thickness relative to the surrounding elements, without appearing unnaturally shrunk or warped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree has an artistic appearance with branches and trunk that are detailed and consistent with a crafted model rather than a natural tree. The proportions are deliberately stylized to fit into a diorama setting, which does not necessarily conform to natural proportions. Therefore, the tree doesnâ€™t maintain natural branch proportions and trunk thickness relative to real-life trees.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the tree's bark and leaves consistent with natural materials, showing no signs of digital over-enhancement such as repeating patterns or unnatural gloss?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree's bark and leaves are crafted to resemble a miniature or model tree with a detailed pattern that suggests a hand-crafted or artificial texture rather than natural. There is no sign of digital over-enhancement as the appearance is consistent with an artistic interpretation in a diorama.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the flower patches beneath the tree uniformly distributed and blended into the existing meadow, without visible cloning artifacts, sharp edges, or color inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flower patches beneath the tree are part of a diorama, showing a uniform distribution consistent with an artistic arrangement. The flowers appear to be intentionally placed, contributing to a cohesive scene without visible cloning or sharp edges.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background behind the tree seamlessly blended, with no visible layering lines, color jumps, or flat regions that break the illusion of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is designed as part of a diorama with clear layers, such as clouds hanging on strings. However, the layers are intentional for the style of the art piece and do not aim to blend seamlessly as in a realistic landscape photo. Thus, from a diorama perspective, they are part of the intended design rather than a defect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cloud figures positioned above the scene on thin, non-visible wires, appearing small and light enough to suggest suspension, without overlapping or intersecting with the tree or ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are deliberately suspended using visible wires as part of the diorama's design. They do not overlap with the tree or ground and fit the crafted theme. The visibility of wires and the small clouds suggest intentional design rather than an error.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the wooden frame clearly visible around the scene with consistent material appearance, straight edges, and proper shadowing that indicates a three-dimensional box structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden frame around the scene is clearly visible, featuring a consistent appearance of wood. The edges are straight and there are shadows that contribute to the perception of a three-dimensional box structure, reinforcing the diorama style.",
