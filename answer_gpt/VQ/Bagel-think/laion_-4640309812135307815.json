    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed bottle maintain the same elongated vertical silhouette as the original dress, with no compression or stretching of the form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle indeed maintains an elongated vertical silhouette similar to the dress in Image A. The fluid, continuous lines of the dress are translated into the bottle's tall, slender form, aligning well with the original design's intent and proportions. This shape consistency can be identified by analyzing the symmetrical and sleek design elements reflected from the original dress to the bottle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the petal motifs clearly visible as raised embossments on the glass surface, with consistent depth and spacing matching the original dress's design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The embossments on the bottle in Image B imitate the petal motifs seen in the dress from Image A. They exhibit a tridimensional appearance on the glass surface, indicating a well-translated representation of the petals. The spacing and layout align with the dress pattern, ensuring that the motifs maintain a coherent aesthetic between both mediums.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cap shaped like a stylized red flower with natural petal curvature and symmetry, and does it sit properly on the bottle neck without floating or overlapping unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap in Image B is shaped like a red flower with a petal design that reflects natural curvature and symmetry, reminiscent of the dress in Image A. It is properly placed on the bottle neck without any apparent floating or misalignment issues, enhancing the bottle's overall appeal and cohesion.",

      "question": "Is the metallic label seamlessly attached to the glass surface with smooth edges, realistic reflection, and legible cursive text, without blurring, misalignment, or shadow mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic label in Image B appears to be well-integrated with the bottle. It features smooth edges, realistic reflections, and legible cursive text, presenting no evidence of blurring or misalignment. This suggests a high-quality design that reflects precision and attention to detail, aligning with the overall aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the neck, body, and base of the bottle proportionally balanced and structurally sound, with no unnatural tapering or abrupt shape changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neck, body, and base of the bottle are well-proportioned, creating a harmonious and structurally sound format. There is no evidence of unnatural tapering or abrupt shape variations, which suggests that the bottle's design accurately represents a refined transition from the dress's form to a functional glass container.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, pixelation, or color bleeding at the boundary where the fabric dress transitions into the glass bottle, indicating poor blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no indications of seams, pixelation, or color bleeding at the interface between the dress fabric design and the bottle's glass material. This suggests that the transition is executed with precision, ensuring a seamless blend that respects the aesthetic continuity from the original fabric design to its glass rendition.",
