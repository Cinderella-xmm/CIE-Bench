      "question": "Are the motion lines surrounding the character in Panel 1 smoothly aligned with the direction of motion and free from jagged edges or inconsistent spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the motion lines surrounding the character are generally smooth and aligned with the direction of motion. The character is depicted in mid-air in a jumping pose, indicating movement. The lines enhance this motion effect and do not show jagged edges or inconsistent spacing. The fluidity of the motion lines matches the character's trajectory logically.",

      "question": "Is the internal monologue bubble positioned close to the character’s head without overlapping facial features or distorting the character’s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the internal monologue bubble in Panel 1 is positioned in the sky without overlapping the character's body or facial features. It’s placed away from the character’s head and in a separate area of the panel, keeping the character's outline intact. Since there's no overlap, the position respects the character's space and ensures clarity.",

      "question": "Does the sky background in Panel 1 display a smooth gradient from warm to cool tones without visible color bands or unnatural transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the sky background transitions smoothly from warmer tones to cooler tones. The area features a harmonious gradient without visible color bands, maintaining a natural and visually aesthetic transition between the different hues, suggesting a realistic sky setting during sunset or sunrise.",

      "question": "Is the parachute in Panel 2 correctly shaped, proportionally sized relative to the character, and connected by visible cords that extend logically from the character’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the parachute appears well-shaped and proportional relative to the character. The structural elements, such as the visible cords, logically connect to the character's back, enhancing the realism of the parachute design and its function within the scene.",

      "question": "Do the animated clouds in both panels appear as distinct volumetric forms with soft edges and no clipping into the character or mountain silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both panels of Image B, the clouds are depicted as distinct volumetric forms with soft edges. The clouds maintain their separation from the character and mountain silhouettes, ensuring no visual clipping or interference with the primary subjects of the scene, which keeps them visually coherent and consistent.",
