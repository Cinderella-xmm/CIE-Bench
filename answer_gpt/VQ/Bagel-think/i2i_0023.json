      "question": "Are the enlarged head of the boy and the shrunken birds proportionate and structurally coherent, avoiding any noticeable distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head and body proportions of the boy are not enlarged compared to the original, Image A. Both appear to have similar proportions, with no noticeable distortion. Additionally, the birds in Image B are a direct representation in cartoon form, maintaining a similar proportion relative to the person when compared to Image A. They all appear coherent within the cartoon style. Therefore, there is no noticeable distortion present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the block colors used for the boy's skin tone and feather textures appear clean and uniform, without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration style employs flat, block colors typical of cartoon drawings. This style uses clean and uniform coloring for both the skin tone of the boy and the birds, which aligns with the overall cartoon aesthetic. There are no visible unnatural artifacts, as all colors are smoothly filled and consistent with the image's cartoon nature.",

      "question": "Are the white outlines around the boy and birds smooth and consistent, without jagged edges or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines around the boy and the birds are smooth and consistent, typical of a well-executed cartoon style. There are no jagged edges or breaks visible, indicating that the outlines were deliberately drawn to fit the seamless look commonly seen in illustrations. This helps maintain the crisp and polished appearance expected in cartoon art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shrunken birds retain their fine details and textures naturally, without losing clarity or appearing pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents both the boy and the birds in a simplified cartoon form, which inherently involves reducing details for stylistic purposes. The fine textures and details present in a realistic photo are not preserved in the cartoon conversion, but this does not result in a loss of clarity or pixelation, as the art style does not require it. The birds are neatly depicted consistent with such illustrative conventions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition with the enlarged boy's head and shrunken birds appear balanced and neatly arranged, providing visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B, despite the cartoon style, maintains balance and seems thoughtfully arranged. The placement of the birds around the boy mirrors the arrangement in Image A, which aids in preserving a sense of visual balance. The arrangement looks intentional, balancing the characters in a way that aligns with credible cartoon illustration practices.",
