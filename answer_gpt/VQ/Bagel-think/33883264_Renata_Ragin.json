    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the transformed towers retain the original stone texture and structural lines, and are they shaped into arms without geometric distortion or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the towers of the bridge appear to have been visually morphed into arm-like structures. The stone texture of the towers has been carefully edited to retain the appearance of the original textured surface, showing attention to creating a continuous, natural look. Therefore, although there's a fictional transformation, the texture and structure are maintained cohesively without geometric distortions or unnatural breaks. This conclusion is supported by observing the continuity in the stone pattern and how the structural lines conform to the new shapes, maintaining a believable appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the suspension cables rendered as continuous, sinewy tendons with consistent metallic texture and natural curvature around the chest area, without fraying or abrupt changes in thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an inspection of areas where cables are visible shows attempts at maintaining the realistic depiction of suspension cables turning into anatomical-like sinewy structures. However, there are visible inconsistencies in thickness and texture of the cables/tendons, particularly around what would be seen as a 'chest area' of the imaginary golem. This hints at a deviation from true, natural curvature and consistent metallic texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the Freedom Tower transformed into a crown with clear, faceted crystal surfaces that reflect light naturally and are positioned directly above the golem’s head without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Freedom Tower appears to remain relatively unchanged in terms of placement and alignment. It doesn't seem to have been transformed into a crown or on top of the golem's head; instead, it still stands prominently in the skyline. Hence, the depiction contradicts the idea of crystal surfaces and new positioning with respect to a virtual golem concept.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers seamlessly integrated into the golem’s body as armor plating, with no visible gaps, overlaps, or misaligned building edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the skyscrapers in the background do not show any edits where they are transformed as part of or integrated into a fictional golem structure. They appear in their original positions, upright, without being modified as perceptual armor plating for a large entity, maintaining their structural integrity. Thus, there are no visible integrations or modifications in their original depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the golem’s base fully anchored to the ground and water, with no floating or disconnected limbs, and does its overall scale match the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B reveals no clear evidence of a golem structure taking over the bridge's position in terms of anchoring to the ground or water. There is no perceptual balance or scale adjusting to fit a fictional being into the environment when considering realistic geography and man-made structures. Therefore, the basis of a golem does not match or anchor realistically within the depicted environment.",
