      "question": "Does the cat’s body maintain the original shape and proportions when transformed into quartz and obsidian crystals, with no visible warping or unnatural breaks in form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is transformed into a crystal form composed mainly of quartz and obsidian. The body's shape and proportions appear consistent with an understanding of how facets and angles might adapt to a crystal form, without looking warped or disconnected. The proportions of its head, torso, and limbs match what would be expected if these elements were crystallized from the original form. This analysis combines visual observation of geometric balance with knowledge of crystal structures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the emerald crystal eyes positioned correctly within the eye sockets, showing consistent size, shape, and reflective qualities that match the original facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the cat's facial features reveals that the emerald crystal eyes are positioned symmetrically within the cat's face, consistent with the eye sockets in the original facial structure. The size and shape of the eyes align with the cat's head proportions, maintaining symmetry and balance. Additionally, the reflective qualities of the crystals enhance the vividness without appearing unnatural.",

      "question": "Are the cat’s front paws and hind legs properly positioned on the wooden block, with no floating or disconnected segments that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal cat's feet rest on the wooden block in a manner consistent with gravity and physical support. The paws are placed firmly on the block without visible gaps or floating segments, following logical positioning for a grounded stance. This analysis is informed by visual observation of contact points and balance and an understanding of how an animal would normally position itself on a surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the quartz and obsidian surfaces display realistic textures with natural variations in translucency, shading, and edge definition, without pixelation or unnatural smoothness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quartz and obsidian surfaces show a high level of detail. The textures display natural variations in translucency and shading, which are consistent with real crystal qualities. The edges are well-defined and faceted, offering a realistic appearance without pixelation or unnaturally smooth textures. This analysis draws on understanding of crystal characteristics and the visual quality of image rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden block visually consistent with the original image in terms of texture, color, and lighting, and does it cast appropriate shadows under the crystal cat without unnatural gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining both Image A and Image B indicates that the wooden block in Image B maintains the original texture, color, and lighting seen in Image A. Shadow casting is realistic, in line with the figure of the crystal cat, and no gaps or distortions in the contact area are evident. The continuity in visual presentation and the physical logic of light and shadow are supported by an understanding of consistency in illustration.",
