      "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B displays a consistent wood grain texture, with detailed engraved patterns visible. However, the inscription panel reads 'Joy to the World,' not 'Peace and Hope,' so this does not match the query for legibility of that specific phrase. The inscription is legible and not blurred, but the text does not meet exactly the given specification.",
