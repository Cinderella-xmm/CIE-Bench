    "Question": "Q5: Does the hand holding the chain have exactly five fingers with natural joint curvature and skin texture, and does the chain follow a continuous, non-intersecting path without breaking or appearing detached?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the hand shows four fingers with stylized shapes consistent with embossed designs rather than natural representations. The chain is abstractly represented in the panel without continuous form, aligning with artistic embossing methods that prioritize design over realistic portrayal.",
