    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the mosaic tiles uniformly distributed across the entire surface of both teddy bears, maintaining consistent size and alignment without visible gaps or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic tiles appear to be very consistently sized, with a uniform distribution across the teddy bears' surfaces. The tiles maintain alignment with no visible gaps or misaligned edges, suggesting a carefully crafted mosaic design. This visual assessment is based on the regularity and order observed in the tiling pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the yellow and turquoise tile patterns on the sweaters follow the original shape and contours of the garments without warping or breaking geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow and turquoise tile patterns on the sweaters are clearly defined and respect the shape and contour of the garments. There is no warping or breaking of the geometric shapes, indicating that the tiles follow the natural lines and form of the sweaters accurately. The design demonstrates a smooth adaptation to the 3D form of the garments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) clearly defined and proportionally correct using shaded tiles, without blurring or misalignment that compromises recognition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth are distinctly outlined using well-placed tiles that ensure the features are proportionally correct. The shading and placement of tiles are precise, allowing for clear recognition without any blurring or misalignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bows retain their original shape and appear with a smooth, reflective surface that contrasts naturally with the surrounding mosaic fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bows in Image B retain an identifiable shape that is distinct from the surrounding mosaic tiles. They appear with a smooth, reflective surface that mimics the luster of smooth materials, providing a visual contrast to the textured mosaic fur. This contrast highlights the bows as distinct, polished elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the white pedestal fully grounded beneath the bears, with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does it maintain clean edges and uniform color without blending issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white pedestal in Image B appears to be solid and well-grounded beneath the teddy bears, showing no gaps or floating effects. Its edges are clean, and the color is uniform, contrasting well with the bears and avoiding any visual blending issues.",
