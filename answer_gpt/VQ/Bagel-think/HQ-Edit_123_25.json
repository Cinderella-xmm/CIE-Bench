      "question": "Are the floral and scroll motifs on the back of the dress clearly defined with smooth edges and no visible pixelation or broken lines after the paper-cut effect is applied?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral and scroll motifs on the back of the dress are examined for clarity and definition. The motifs appear to be precisely outlined with smooth edges, maintaining their intricate design. The paper-cut effect in Image B enhances the motifs by giving them a more pronounced and artistic appearance without introducing pixelation or broken lines. This suggests careful editing to preserve the quality of the motifs, typical of professional graphic design work focused on maintaining visual clarity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the blue gradient overlay on the dress transition smoothly without creating abrupt color boundaries or altering the underlying texture of the fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a blue gradient overlay on the dress. The transition in color from one shade of blue to another is observed to be gradual and smooth, creating a natural blending without visible harsh lines or disruptions. The underlying texture of the fabric is preserved, indicating that the overlay was applied with care to maintain the realness of the material. Such editing requires advanced techniques to ensure subtle color changes that align with the natural drape and flow of fabric.",

      "question": "Is the silver tone of the hair accessory uniform and reflective in a way that matches the lighting direction and does not show unnatural highlights or dark patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When examining Image B, the hair accessory has a consistent silver tone that aligns with the lighting conditions in the scene. The lighting appears to come from the top left, and the accessory has corresponding reflective properties that highlight its details without showing unnatural highlights or dark patches. This consistency in lighting and tone demonstrates proficient blending techniques to maintain a realistic appearance, crucial in editing to uphold the object's authenticity under the given light source.",

      "question": "Do the bamboo patterns in the third postcard align correctly with the background bamboo stalks and maintain consistent spacing and perspective without overlapping or floating anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third postcard uses bamboo patterns that are scrutinized for proper alignment and consistency. The patterns are carefully matched to the surrounding bamboo stalks in the background, maintaining uniform spacing and correct perspective. There are no visual anomalies such as overlapping or floating patterns, which suggests that the editing process accurately incorporated these patterns to blend seamlessly with the background. Ensuring such alignment requires attention to detail in managing image perspective and scale.",

      "question": "Does the silk-bound book have a consistent material texture, proper thickness, and clean edges that match the appearance of a real physical object without stretching or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silk-bound book in Image B is evaluated for texture, thickness, and edge definition. It appears to have a consistent silk texture throughout its surface, maintaining a realistic material aesthetic. The thickness is suitable for a book, and the edges are clean and well-defined, matching the expected attributes of a physical book. There is no evidence of stretching or warping, which implies that the image maintains realism in representing textures and dimensions, typically achieved through refined editing techniques.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays three postcards positioned within the book layout. These are checked for equal spacing, which is consistent, providing uniform margins. The postcards are fully visible without partial cropping or overlap. This organization indicates careful planning in their layout to ensure a clean and aesthetically pleasing visual presentation, which enhances the overall coherence and professionalism of the edited image.",
