      "question": "Do the added text elements such as titles and headings appear seamlessly integrated into the scene without introducing unnatural textures or disrupting the surrounding design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the added text elements have been placed over the painting and next to the bed. Considering the surroundings in a bedroom, these text elements show a stark contrast between the natural tones and the added black and white text modules, which introduces an unnatural texture against the familiar environment of the room This suggests that the text disrupts the cohesive design of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and placements of the newly added text elements appropriate, ensuring they do not distort the geometric shapes or disrupt the roomâ€™s layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows text placed over the painting and partially over the bed. The proportions of the text elements are large compared to the furniture and the painting and have no alignment with the usual geometric shapes within the room (such as furniture edges, paintings, etc.). This results in some distortion of the spatial layout, such as overlapping key elements like art and furnishings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the style and material used for the text modules match the room's decor, maintaining a cohesive look without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The newly added text elements in Image B use bold, modern fonts and a contrasting black and white color scheme. The room's decor features natural wood tones and soft lighting, which is disrupted by these stark black and white elements, making them appear out of place against the softer, more earthy decor style.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the magazine cover design elements, when placed over the bedroom image, seem visually credible and avoid unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The placement and style of the magazine cover elements over the bedroom image in Image B seem to disrupt the natural interior setting, resulting in a disjointed composition. The text overlays and graphic blocks do not seamlessly blend with the existing elements of the image and introduce a sense of artificial overlay rather than credible incorporation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details within the added text elements (titles, headings, and price recommendations) preserved, ensuring their clarity and legibility without degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the text is readable, the bold fonts and their placement on a softly colored background create a noticeable distraction rather than integration. The clarity and legibility are maintained, but it contrasts sharply against the subdued colors of the room, indicating disruption in visual continuity rather than degradation.",
