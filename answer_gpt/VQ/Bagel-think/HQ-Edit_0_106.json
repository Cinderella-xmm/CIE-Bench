      "question": "Does the lion’s silhouette maintain correct anatomical proportions and smooth edge definition without visible pixelation or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the lion should have natural anatomy that resembles a real lion, with smooth edges forming its body and mane. The pixels should align logically to maintain smooth contour lines without distortion. Based on visual cues, the silhouette maintains the familiar shape of a lion with smooth edges, not showing any visible pixelation or distortion, and the proportions seem correct by matching what one would expect for a lion's silhouette.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the color transitions in the abstract gradient backdrop smooth and free from visible banding or unnatural color boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backdrop in Image B features a gradient transition from blue to yellow. A smooth color transition is one where the change in hue is gradual, with no abrupt changes or bands separating colors. From the visual inspection, the colors blend smoothly, and there are no evident banding effects or stark color boundaries. This suggests a well-managed gradient presentation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the grass textures in the foreground appear naturally lit and spatially coherent with the rest of the scene, without repeating patterns or artificial sharpness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In assessing the grass textures within Image B, they should appear naturally integrated into the scene, lit in a manner consistent with the rest of the environment, especially from the light source (the transition area between colors). The texture should avoid repetitive patterns and overly sharp details that may not be spatially consistent. The grassy foreground in Image B seems naturally blended with smooth transitions, coherent with other compositional elements, without artificial repetition or sharpness noted.",

      "question": "Are the angular acacia tree silhouettes structurally plausible and visually balanced within the composition, without broken branches or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Acacia trees, characterized by their distinctive flattened canopy, should be proportionally accurate and integrated into the composition without awkward angles or incorrect branching. In Image B, the silhouetted trees align with the expected structure seen in such trees, displaying balanced visuals consistent with natural acacia formations without any broken parts or odd angles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title text positioned above the lion without overlapping its head or body, and does it maintain legible contrast without introducing visual noise or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B should be placed so as not to interfere with the lion’s silhouette. It should be distinctly readable with a contrast that ensures visibility without disrupting the scene’s balance. Noticing its placement, the text indeed appears above the lion's silhouette, retaining clear visibility with an effective contrast that preserves legibility. There is no evidence of the text interfering with the visual coherence by overlapping the lion silhouette or introducing noise.",
