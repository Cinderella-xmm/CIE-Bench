      "question": "Are the eyes of the woman and child enlarged but still aligned with their facial structures without visible distortion or unnatural spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the woman and child appear to be part of a cartoon-like representation, which often features larger and expressive eyes. Based on the enlarged eyes in the illustration style, they are still aligned with the facial structures, fitting the character design without causing distortion or awkward spacing. Within the realm of cartoon depiction, this representation does not have the disproportionate placement typical in such styles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hands of the woman and child show five fingers each, with natural finger curvature and no overlapping or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, when depicting hands in a cartoon style, artists often simplify finger features but maintain five visible fingers per hand. Upon analysis of Image B, each hand has five fingers with a plausible curvature typically used in this style. No fingers are overlapping or missing in the illustration style, which is in line with cartoon depiction standards.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the color transitions across the woman’s dress, the child’s dress, and the background flowers smooth and free of sharp digital edges or unnatural blotches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals that the color transitions are smooth, typical of painted or hand-drawn art style usually featuring soft gradients and harmonious color blending. The dresses of the characters along with the flowers in the background exhibit smooth transitions without any sharp digital edges or unnatural blotches, supporting the overall cohesive aesthetic of the artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the added floral accents in the background consistent in size, lighting, and texture with the existing flowers and do they cast plausible shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral accents appear to maintain consistent size and texture with a portrayal style akin to other elements within the art but lack real-world lighting interactions such as shadows. Cartoons focus more on color and size consistency than on shadows due to their simpler depictions. Hence, consistency with image texture and color is maintained, even if realistic shadows are not depicted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the wooden border have uniform thickness, natural wood grain, and proper alignment with the image edges without gaps or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals the wooden border is symmetric with a consistent thickness around the frame. The realistic depiction of wood grain texture fits naturally within the overall image and is aligned properly with the edge, showing no signs of gaps or warping, harmonizing well in the artwork's composition.",
