      "question": "Is the horseâ€™s head enlarged proportionally so that facial features like the eyes and muzzle remain clearly defined and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a plush toy resembling a horse is depicted rather than a real horse. The toy's head is designed to be proportionally large as is typical for plush toys to enhance cuteness, and its facial features are clear and undistorted. They are crafted to be visually appealing and identifiable, similar to facial features on typical high-quality plush arts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the body of the plush horse display a consistent fabric texture with soft, non-reflective surfaces and no abrupt transitions between color regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy exhibits a consistent fabric texture common to stuffed animals, characterized by a soft and non-reflective surface. The transitions between color regions on the plush toy are smooth and gradual, typical of quality craftsmanship in plush toy manufacturing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes and mouth of the plush horse depicted with visible stitching patterns and raised texture consistent with embroidery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes and mouth in Image B appear to be cartoonishly large and are typical for plush toys. However, they seem smoothly integrated into the surface rather than having visible stitching or raised textures that would imply embroidery. They might be printed directly on the fabric or made from non-embroidered material.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plush toy in Image B has been designed with short and thick legs, typical of such toys, giving a cuddly appearance. The legs show smooth and rounded shapes, presenting a cohesive geometrical structure without any distortion or break in lines.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dandelions in the foreground composed of flat, circular felt-like discs on straight stems, lacking naturalistic detail or depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dandelions are represented as simplified, felt-like discs attached to straight stems, which is a common design used in plush or diorama settings to emphasize a stylized rather than realistic appearance. They lack the intricate detail typically found in natural dandelions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of stylized tree shapes and does not exhibit depth cues like overlapping trees or atmospheric perspective. This aligns with the simplified, flat representation often used in boxed or framed plush displays, where the focus is on the foreground object.",
