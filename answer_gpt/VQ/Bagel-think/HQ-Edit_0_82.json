      "question": "Does the line-art representation of the elderly man maintain accurate proportions and natural joint alignment in his tai chi stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the line-art of the elderly man seems to show a simplified version of the stance that he's holding in Image A, which is a tai chi position. The proportions, such as the alignment of his raised leg and the bent arm, are kept consistent with what would be expected in a balanced pose, despite the abstraction found in line art. This suggests that the art does maintain accurate proportions and joint alignment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pastel watercolor tones applied uniformly across the scene, preserving smooth gradients and avoiding harsh edges or inconsistent color zones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastel tones are extended from Image A's original photography, maintaining a soft gradient transition that complements the form as both cherry blossoms and soft hues create a harmonious scene. The image demonstrates a uniform watercolor application that enhances the peaceful ambiance without introducing harsh or abrupt color changes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossom patterns integrated naturally into the background, maintaining depth and perspective consistency with the existing trees and mist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B places cherry blossom patterns within the scene using a style that mimics the potential blooming seen in Image A's trees. Additionally, while maintaining the background's visual coherence, the illustrated element integrates into the misty landscape without disrupting spatial harmony or depth consistency.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the date grids placed in a way that respects the spatial boundaries of the scene, such as being anchored to the ground or wall without overlapping the manâ€™s body or distorting his silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the date grids are positioned below the line-art representation of the man, ensuring they do not interfere with his tai chi stance or silhouette. The grid respects the spatial layout, serving its purpose as calendar dates without causing any visual disturbance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand forming the \"OK\" gesture have exactly five fingers, with natural joint curvature and no elongated, missing, or duplicated digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the hand depicted in line art shows the \"OK\" gesture with three visible fingers and a thumb visible, including a naturally curved index finger, ensuring proper alignment and proportionality while suggesting the presence of five fingers altogether.",
