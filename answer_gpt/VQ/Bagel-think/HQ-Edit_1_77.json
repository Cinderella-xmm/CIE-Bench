      "question": "Are the facial features and body proportions of the central figure preserved and undistorted despite the artistic transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body proportions of the central figure appear consistent and undistorted. Despite the artistic style, the way the beads are arranged and the overall silhouette retain the natural human form, suggesting that the body proportions are preserved. The artistic transformation primarily affects the background and embellishments rather than the proportions of the figure itself.",

      "question": "Are the added Maasai motifs on the blue garment aligned with the fabric's folds and free from jagged edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue garment on the central figure is artistically enhanced, with the colors being more vibrant. However, the Maasai motifs do not appear to be prominently visible or misaligned against the garment. The blue dress appears smooth, and there are no jagged edges or discernible Maasai motifs overlaying it.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements on the bead ornaments emit light in a controlled manner without creating halos or color bleed onto the skin or fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bead ornaments exhibit glowing elements that are placed on the hair. These elements are visible with distinct yellow dots that do not exhibit any significant halos or color bleed onto the skin or fabric. The light emission appears to be controlled, staying within the beads themselves.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the brush strokes in the background evenly applied and do they preserve the correct shapes and positions of trees, terrain, and horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has undergone an artistic transformation that emphasizes vibrant colors and stylized clouds, trees, and terrain. While these elements are more colorful and stylized compared to Image A, the main shapes and positions of the trees and the horizon remain recognizable. The horizon line is maintained, and the brush strokes do not distort the overall scene structure.",

      "question": "Are the bead ornaments on the neck, arms, and headpiece fully intact with no missing, duplicated, or warped segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bead ornaments on the neck, arms, and headpiece remain intact. The structure of the beads follows traditional Maasai styles without noticeable duplications or warped segments. The artistic transformation primarily involves color enhancement rather than alteration of their physical structure, maintaining their integrity.",
