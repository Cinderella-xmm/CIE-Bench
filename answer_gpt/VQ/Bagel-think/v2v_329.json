      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the shapes and proportions of the 3D chibi-style bicycles consistent with their original forms, avoiding any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shapes and proportions of the bicycles are maintained in a way that resembles their original forms. The distinctive features and structures of each bicycle are preserved, and the proportions appear consistent with typical bicycle designs. Based on the visual cues, there are no apparent unnatural distortions in the bicycles' shapes.",

      "question": "Do the colors of the 3D chibi-style bicycles match their original counterparts without introducing any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the color scheme of each bicycle from Image A, preserving the distinct colors such as the red, blue, and cream hues. The textures visible in Image B are natural and do not diverge from the typical appearance of bicycle materials, ensuring color accuracy.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the 3D chibi-style bicycles arranged in the same relative positions and spacing as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the bicycles are positioned similarly, maintaining the same relative spacing and alignment. The arrangements show no changes in positioning between Image A and Image B, suggesting consistency in layout.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the 3D chibi-style bicycles align naturally with the light source and the floor, contributing to the overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays shadows for each bicycle that align with the light source from the window. The shadows mimic those seen in Image A, suggesting a consistent interaction between light and objects on the highly reflective floor. This alignment contributes to the realism and authenticity of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the wheels, frames, and other components of the 3D chibi-style bicycles retained their fine details without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The detailed components like wheels, frames, and handlebars in Image B maintain the same clarity and precision as observed in Image A. There is careful attention to detail without any visible artifacts or oversimplifications in the chibi-style representation.",
