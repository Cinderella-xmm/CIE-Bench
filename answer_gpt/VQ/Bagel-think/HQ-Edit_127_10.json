    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the upper and lower tiers clearly defined with consistent perspective and proportional scaling, and is there a visible separation between them that suggests a layered structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts a snow globe with a scene inside. The upper tier consists of buildings, including two Eiffel Towers, while the lower tier has trees and a cobblestone path. The perspective and scaling show that the Eiffel Towers and other buildings are uniformly proportioned in comparison to the size of the trees, with a clear separation between the cityscape and the base of the snow globe suggesting a layered structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the buildings in the upper tier have a metallic sheen with subtle reflections and gradients that match the lighting direction, and are there no flat or unnaturally uniform color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the snow globe, the buildings are crafted to mimic a metallic appearance, with reflective surfaces that give the illusion of varying gradients as light interacts with the miniatures. This attention to detail avoids the use of flat color patches, suggesting a realistic representation of building materials.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the trees and bushes in the lower tier composed of irregular, naturally shaped forms with varying heights and densities, and do they lack repeating texture tiles or unnatural symmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees and bushes within the snow globe are presented in a uniformly symmetrical layout with repeating spherical shapes and consistent heights across the scene, indicating a lack of natural variation typically found in real vegetation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the silvery flakes distributed across the space between tiers with soft edges, slight blurring, and depth-based opacity, indicating movement through air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe features silvery flakes suspended within the dome. They have a relatively uniform distribution without noticeable depth variation in opacity or blur, indicating an artificial distribution rather than depicting natural movement through air.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base show individually rendered cobblestones with visible grout lines and surface variations, and are the street lamps proportionally sized and evenly spaced along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cobblestones on the base within the snow globe are individually rendered with visible grout lines, presenting a textured surface that mimics realistic stone paths. However, street lamps are absent from this depiction, indicating a limitation in street scene details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are both Eiffel Towers structurally intact with correct lattice patterns, uniform scaling, and no stretched or compressed sections that deviate from their known design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Eiffel Towers inside the snow globe maintain their iconic lattice patterns and structural integrity, resized proportionally within the scene without any signs of stretching or compression that would deviate from their recognized design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
