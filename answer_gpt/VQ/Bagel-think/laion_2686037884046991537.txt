    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes and mouth drawn on the whoopie pie surfaces aligned with the curvature of the cookie and free from visible distortions or floating elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible eyes or mouths drawn on the whoopie pies. The image is a simplistic cartoon depicting whoopie pies being held, with no features that suggest facial components are drawn and aligned with the curvature of the cookies.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the chocolate cookie surface retain its original texture pattern (such as cracks and dimples) beneath the cartoon-style coloring, or is it completely smoothed out in an unnatural way?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon rendering lacks detailed texture patterns as the original whoopie pies in Image A, indicating that the cartoon style has smoothed out any texture to conform to a simple, flat colored style.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the limbs of the whoopie pie characters proportionally scaled to the cookie body and connected at logical points (e.g., sides or top), without appearing detached or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no limbs attached to the whoopie pies as they are depicted as simply floating objects in a cartoon panel. Hence, there are no limbs to assess for proportionality or connection.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the spatula held by the leading whoopie pie character proportionally sized compared to the cookie body and oriented in a way that suggests natural grip and movement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a spatula is shown next to a whoopie pie on the table in a cartoon style, but it is not being held by a whoopie pie character. Therefore, there is no association of a character holding a spatula for an assessment.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the two whoopie pie characters peering over the edge of the plate positioned so that their lower halves remain below the plate’s edge, with no unnatural floating or cut-off limbs?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict whoopie pies peering over edges with visible lower halves, rather, it shows floating whoopie pies held by cartoon characters without visible adherence to such anatomical or physical logic.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the text bubble containing “I heard today’s flavor is mint! Let’s find it!” placed adjacent to the speaking character without overlapping critical features like eyes or limbs, and is the handwritten font clear and unblurred?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a text bubble, but the text is not precisely as stated, and characters are not drawn with distinguishable eyes or limbs that might be overlapped. The font appears cartoonish and slightly unclear, implying a lack of clarity.",
    "answer": "No"
