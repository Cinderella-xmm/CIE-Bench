      "question": "Are the textures on the bike frame and surrounding grass natural, without any visible artifacts or unnatural color variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable abstract and textured design that does not resemble any natural elements such as a bike or grass. The colors and patterns in Image B appear artificial and do not display natural textures or colors that would be consistent with an image of a bike frame and grass. Therefore, given the abstract and digital-looking design in Image B, the textures cannot be considered natural.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wheels and frame of the bike maintain their correct proportions and geometry, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a bike with wheels and a frame. Instead, it features abstract elements that do not have any recognizable geometric forms or structures of a bike. Consequently, this abstract representation does not maintain any correct proportions or geometry expected of a bicycle.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background clean and free from distracting elements, preserving the natural scene and focusing on the bike without introducing unnecessary elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B does not include any natural scenes or elements that could serve as a distraction. The image is composed of an abstract design and lacks any complex or recognizable background details. However, the abstract nature itself can be considered distracting since it doesn't resemble a natural or coherent environment that would appropriately accompany a bike.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the bike and the surrounding area look natural and consistent with the original environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any realistic lighting or shadows that would be consistent with a real environment. The entire image consists of flat, abstract graphics devoid of lighting nuances or shadow effects typically found in natural environments. Therefore, it is not possible for the lighting and shadows to be consistent with any original environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bike positioned naturally within the frame, maintaining visual coherence and plausibility without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a bike, but rather an abstract and digital design. Thus, there is no frame or bike positioning to analyze in terms of natural placement or visual coherence. Given the abstract nature of the image, it cannot be said to maintain natural visual coherence or plausible positioning relative to a bicycle context.",
