      "question": "Does the circular badge appear seamlessly integrated into the scene without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular badge is held by a hand, showcasing a scene including the Statue of Liberty, Eiffel Tower, and London Eye. The integration refers to how naturally these elements fit together without causing any visual distraction. The badge appears artistically drawn and distinct from a photo-realistic style, giving it an illustrative and stylized look. This artistic approach inherently lacks photo-realistic seamless integration but maintains consistency within its visual context.",

      "question": "Are the fingers of the hand holding the badge correctly shaped and detailed, without any unnatural deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the badge is depicted in a stylized manner, typical of illustrative artwork. The fingers are simplified yet recognizable, and there are no obvious signs of deformation. Considering the artistic style, the fingers maintain a coherent shape aligned with the style chosen for the illustration.",

      "question": "Do the features of the Statue of Liberty, Eiffel Tower, and London Eye on the badge retain their recognizable shapes and proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases these landmarks within the badge, depicted in a simplified, illustrative style. Despite this simplification, the basic shapes and iconic features of the Statue of Liberty, Eiffel Tower, and London Eye are maintained, ensuring they are recognizable within the stylized context.",

      "question": "Does the addition of the badge preserve the structural consistency of the surrounding landmarks, without causing any visual disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landmarks inside the badge stand apart from the background and are framed by an illustrative hand holding the badge. The landmarks maintain their iconic forms within the badge, but the integration with the surrounding scene doesn't preserve structural consistency due to its illustrative style, differing from a photorealistic presentation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tassels are part of the illustrative design, depicted with stylized lines and texture. Though they are simplified and follow the chosen artistic style, they contribute effectively to the visual quality by offering a decorative element consistent with the intended stylized badge.",
