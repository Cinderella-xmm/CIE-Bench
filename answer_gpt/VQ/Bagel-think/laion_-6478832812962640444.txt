    "Question": "Q3: Are the transformed patterns along the shaft and toe area composed of sharp, consistent geometric lines without distorting the boot's outline or causing unnatural swelling or compression?",
    "explanation": "The design in Image B employs sharp geometric lines that are consistent and do not seem to distort the overall outline of the boot. The patterns are applied in a way that retains the natural contours of the boot without leading to any swelling or compression artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the metallic inlays exhibit uniform specular highlights without bright spots, halos, or uneven reflections that suggest digital noise or over-processing?",
    "explanation": "The metallic surfaces in Image B reflect light evenly, showing smooth specular highlights. There is an absence of bright spots, halos, or any form of uneven reflections, suggesting high quality rendering without digital noise or over-processing issues.",
    "answer": "Yes"
