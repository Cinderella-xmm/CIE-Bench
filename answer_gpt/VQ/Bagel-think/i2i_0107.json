      "question": "Does the chibi version preserve distinct facial features like hair texture and glasses in a way that remains visually consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi version of the character is a miniature, stylized representation that emphasizes simpler shapes and a more cartoonish aesthetic. The hair is simplified and lacks detailed texture compared to the realistic depiction in Image A. Glasses are absent in Image B, which are typically associated with the character's visual features. The chibi design does not prioritize maintaining intricate details like hair texture and specific accessories, focusing instead on a generalized artistic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scarf and the wand being held in the hand rendered with natural textures that match the other elements in the chibi figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarf is depicted with flat colors and simple patterns characteristic of the chibi style, rather than realistic textures. The wand is similarly simplified without intricate details. While these elements do not have complex, realistic textures, they maintain consistency with the overall chibi aesthetic, which prioritizes simplicity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand holding the wand proportionate with the rest of the chibi figure's body, and does it look anatomically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi characters are intentionally designed with exaggerated proportions, like larger heads and smaller bodies. In Image B, the hand holding the wand is proportionate concerning the chibi style, although it does not conform to realistic anatomy. It fits the artistic choice typical of chibi designs, where anatomical plausibility is secondary to the whimsical character design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the chibi character blend naturally into the wooden background without any visible artifacts or unnatural shadows that disrupt the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is photographed against a wooden background. The lighting and shadows are consistent and do not have any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies that would disrupt the image's visual cohesion. The character appears naturally integrated into the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scarf and tie designed with coherent shapes that do not introduce any broken or distorted geometries, preserving the chibi aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scarf and tie in Image B are reinterpreted within the chibi style, maintaining coherent shapes without distorted geometries. They are stylized appropriately to match the chibi theme, emphasizing simple, clear, and rounded forms typical of this artistic approach.",
