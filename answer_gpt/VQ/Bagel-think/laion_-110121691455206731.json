    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) positioned on the dial such that they do not obscure the numerals or subdials, and do they blend with the metallic texture without introducing unnatural shading or edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no additional facial features positioned on the dial of the watch. The dials maintain the original watch's design without extraneous elements. The dial appears consistent and clean without any interference or additional detailing that resembles facial features. This aligns with common comic adaptations where facial features are usually emphasized, which is not the case here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the detective desk and magnifying glass proportionally sized relative to the watch, and are they rendered with consistent line weight and shading that matches the comic style without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized comic rendition with a magnifying glass interacting with the watch. The size of the magnifying glass in relation to the watch seems appropriate for a comic style, where exaggerated proportions are common. The shading and line weight are consistent, reflecting a typical comic illustration style, thus maintaining visual cohesion in the depiction.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the background elements (cluttered office items) appear spatially coherent with the watch, showing correct layering and perspective without overlapping or clipping through the watch's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch is shown with a background that lacks detailed cluttered office items, focusing on the watch itself within a comic frame. There are no visible overlapping or clipping artifacts that break spatial coherence. The elements within the comic are simplified, adhering to a typical comic style where such complexity is often reduced.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tick mark sound effects uniformly shaped and cleanly rendered around the dial, without jagged edges, smudging, or inconsistent spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch is portrayed without additional tick mark sound effects that are common in comics to indicate sound. The focus instead remains on the visual representation of the watch in a comic style, without any supplementary jagged or smudged lines. This maintains the aesthetic typical of both comics and watch illustrations, ensuring clarity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the stylized version retain the original texture of the black leather strap and the brushed silver finish of the case, with no visible texture warping or color inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a comic illustration style, which simplifies textures into flat coloring relative to realism in Image A. The watch strap and case are represented as lines and shades without the intricacy of texture detail seen in Image A. This simplification is typical of comic art styles and does not introduce noticeable warping or color inconsistency despite the absence of the real texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the hour and minute hands, subdials, and date window preserved in their original positions and proportions, without being obscured or deformed by the added facial features or other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the transition to a comic style, the hour and minute hands, subdials, and date window maintain their positions relative to their design in Image A. There are no facial features added that could obscure these components. They are portrayed consistently, preserving their clarity and function as in the original representation.",
