      "question": "Does the word \"warm\" blend seamlessly into the top left corner without disrupting the natural appearance and introducing any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'warm' does not appear in the top left corner. Instead, the words 'frent' and 'rend' are visible at the top. These words have been inserted in a manner that disrupts the seamlessness expected in that area. Additionally, these words seem to float unnaturally above the foreground and do not enter into a natural relationship with the surrounding objects, like the curtains or wall. This indicates incorrect placement and integration compared to the original image without unnatural text. Therefore, the word 'warm' itself does not blend seamlessly into the top left corner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the addition of the word \"warm\" at the top left corner maintained the structural consistency of surrounding elements like the sofa and cushions, avoiding any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the words 'frent' and 'rend' rather than 'warm,' added at the top center rather than the corner. These words exist independent of the sofa and cushions structurally, preserving structural consistency. However, the words themselves do not adhere to the same structural consistency, disrupting the overall natural appearance of the edited part of the image. The placement of the words 'frent' and 'rend' does not seem to create distortion in the elements like the sofa and cushions from the image. The placement appears slightly floating above and not directly affecting these elements physically.",

      "question": "Does the size and font of the word \"warm\" maintain visual plausibility and authentic integration with the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The words 'frent' and 'rend' are present instead of 'warm' in the edited image. The chosen font is large, bold, and visually stands out, clearly contrasting with the subtle and calm components of the room. This contrast in style and scale does not create visual plausibility or authentic integration with the rest of the image, as it disrupts the gentle atmosphere depicted in the painted artwork and serene room setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the word \"freedom\" at the bottom right corner added in a manner that preserves the fine details of the floor and plant, avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no word 'freedom' added at the bottom right corner in Image B. The focus in the edited image is on the words 'frent' and 'rend' at the top. Hence, there is no comparison or preservation required for the plant or floor detail at the bottom right corner. The added text does not interfere with the bottom right area of the image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement of the word \"freedom\" at the bottom right corner respect the structural integrity of nearby elements, such as the corner of the rug and plant pot base, without causing any visible distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text does not appear at the bottom right corner of Image B, indicating no integration of the word 'freedom.' The structural integrity of elements like the corner of the rug and plant pot base remains intact in the edited image. No distortion or alteration occurs in these lower-right components due to non-placement of any text there, maintaining the original structure from Image A.",
