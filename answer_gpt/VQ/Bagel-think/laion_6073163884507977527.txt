    "Question": "Q3: Do the newly added shrubs have a size and texture consistent with the existing plants in the scene?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows shrubs that visually appear similar in size and texture to the tree on the left side of the scene. This consistent sizing and texturing suggest that the shrubs have been integrated to match the existing botanical elements, maintaining uniformity in the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the lake positioned on the ground with defined edges and a reflective surface that interacts realistically with surrounding elements?",

    "Question": "Q5: Are the fairy lights wrapped around the tree branches in a way that follows their shape and emits a soft, uniform glow without harsh highlights?",
    "explanation": "There appears to be no evidence of fairy lights being included in Image B; thus, their presence and characteristics cannot be evaluated based on the existing image. The question presupposes an element not visible in the provided Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q7: Are all added elements (dome, lake, bridge, lights) rendered with materials and lighting that match the rustic, natural aesthetic of the original scene?",
    "explanation": "Elements such as the dome, lake, and bridge in Image B hold to the rustic, natural aesthetic of the scene through their materials and lighting. However, since fairy lights are not visibly included, they cannot be assessed. The existing elements maintain a coherence in style with the original components such as the house and surroundings.",
