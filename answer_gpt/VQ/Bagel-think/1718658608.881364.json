      "question": "Do the ceramic sculptures exhibit a uniform glossy finish with realistic reflections that align with the direction and intensity of the sunset light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows ceramic sculptures with a glossy finish, as indicated by the consistent shine and reflection seen on their surface. However, unlike Image A, there is no sunset visible to determine the alignment of reflections with any light source direction or intensity. Therefore, the question's premise about sunset light is not applicable; the reflections present seem more typical of a controlled indoor lighting situation rather than a natural sunset setting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textured scales evenly distributed across the sculpture surfaces without visible repetition, distortion, or sharp edges suggesting digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture has scales that appear evenly distributed across its surface. The scales do not exhibit visible repetition or distortion, and the edges are smooth, indicating professional artistic craftsmanship rather than digital artifacting. This suggests that the evenness and texture are well-maintained across the sculpture.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the deep oceanic blue coloration of the sculptures consistent across all parts and harmonious with the surrounding ocean and sky colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a consistent deep blue coloration on the sculptures. However, the background is predominantly a sandy-colored environment and not representative of ocean or sky colors, which implies no variation or harmony with ocean or sky colors. This means the deep blue does not interact or harmonize with the surrounding colors as it would in a more natural setting.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly sandy-colored with no visible traces of the original ocean, waves, or shoreline elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a sandy-colored surface with no elements like ocean, waves, or shoreline visible. This contrasts Image A, which features a coastal environment. The complete absence of such maritime elements confirms a uniform sandy background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sculptures arranged in a continuous, flowing wave pattern that matches the curvature and rhythm of the original ocean waves in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the sculpture on a flat sandy-colored surface, lacking any visible arrangement that imitates or continues the curvature and flow of ocean waves as seen in Image A. There are no elements resembling ocean waves, suggesting that the arrangement doesnâ€™t reflect maritime fluidity.",
