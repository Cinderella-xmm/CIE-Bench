      "question": "Does the transparent glass material retain the denim blue tint without unnatural color bleeding or inconsistent opacity across the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the object is a glass bottle tinted in a gradient blue color. The blue tint is evenly distributed throughout the glass, creating a consistent and smooth appearance. There is no visible color bleeding or variation in opacity, suggesting a high-quality glass material. The glass retains a consistent shade of blue that aligns with its transparency properties, indicating no issues with color consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the embossed metallic branding elements positioned correctly over the original back pocket area without distorting the surrounding fabric or creating visible seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an embossed metallic branding element visible, but it is not associated with any fabric or pocket, as the image is of a glass bottle rather than denim. The metallic badge is centrally aligned on the glass surface without distorting any material because it adorns the bottle directly, negating the presence of fabric or seams.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the silver button-shaped cap properly aligned with the waistband and securely attached without gaps or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, a silver button-shaped cap is present, but it is affixed to the top of a glass bottle, not a waistband. The cap fits seamlessly onto the bottle without any gaps or signs of floating, indicating proper alignment and attachment. The absence of clothing material and the bottle's design eliminate concerns of alignment with a waistband.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the lace-up details on both legs have symmetrical threading and bow knots that follow the natural curve of the leg without distortion or clipping through the fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any lace-up details or fabric. The bottle design is devoid of any fabric-related elements such as threading or bow knots. Therefore, the question about lace-up details distorting fabric does not apply to the object depicted in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the flared leg section maintain smooth, continuous curvature without sharp breaks, pixelation, or stretched textures indicating geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists of a glass bottle that has flared sections at its base, akin to the flared legs of pants. The curvature of the bottle maintains a smooth and continuous outline without interruptions, pixelation, or texture distortions, resulting in a coherent and fluid geometry typical of well-crafted glassware.",
