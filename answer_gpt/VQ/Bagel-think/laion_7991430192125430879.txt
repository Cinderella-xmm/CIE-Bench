    "Question": "Q1: Does the translucent green LEGO brick construction of the bottle’s body maintain a consistent cylindrical form without visible warping or misalignment between bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is constructed with LEGO bricks and appears to maintain a cylindrically consistent form without noticeable warping or misalignment. The bricks are aligned smoothly, creating a uniform shape. This is consistent with LEGO constructions where the regularity and precision of the bricks ensure a consistent form. Thus, from the visual cues, the construction seems flawless with no visible misalignment.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are the smaller text elements such as 'natural mint flavor' and 'Simply pour over ice' fully visible and correctly spaced on the LEGO label, without overlapping or broken lettering?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the smaller text elements such as 'natural mint flavor' and 'Simply pour over ice' are not clearly visible or identifiable due to the stylized construction of the label using LEGO bricks. These details may be obscured or omitted given the limitations of reproducing fine text with LEGO bricks, which lack the precision to display intricate text clearly.",
    "answer": "No"
