      "question": "Does the transformed character have correctly proportioned limbs and head with no signs of unnatural stiffness or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character's torso, arms, and legs appear proportionate relative to each other. There is no observable stiffness in the limbs, suggesting an understanding of basic anatomy in the illustration. The positioning of the arms and hands is natural, indicating a deliberate and skillful rendering.",

      "question": "Are the layers of the lace dress clearly defined with natural folds and shadows, and do they interact with light in a believable way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layers of the lace dress are evidently well-defined, showcasing multiple layers with natural folds that follow the contours of the dress. Shadows align with these contours, and the light interaction appears realistic, enhancing the perception of depth and texture.",

      "question": "Does the wooden sewing kit have visible wood texture, appropriate internal components, and correct shadow alignment with the surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sewing kit presents a visible wood texture, showing grain patterns typical of wooden surfaces. It features internal components that appear fitting for a sewing kit. The shadows it casts align properly with the illumination from the lamp, adhering to realistic lighting principles.",

      "question": "Is the porcelain figurine rendered with a smooth, reflective surface and accurate three-dimensional shape that matches the scale of the original cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine has a polished, reflective surface characteristic of porcelain. Its three-dimensional shape is accurately depicted, but when compared with the original cat, it seems sized appropriately as a small decor item on the chair, fitting within the context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the oil lamp have a structurally sound design with visible glass and metal parts, and does it emit light that creates soft, realistic illumination and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The oil lamp shows a well-constructed design with distinguishable glass and metal components. It emits light that radiates softly across the scene, casting realistic shadows that delineate the space around it and demonstrate an understanding of light diffusion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rocking chair appears well-positioned on the ground, giving no indication of instability. Its scale is appropriate for the character seated on it, and it lacks geometric irregularities, such as bent legs or incorrectly aligned joints, ensuring structural continuity.",
