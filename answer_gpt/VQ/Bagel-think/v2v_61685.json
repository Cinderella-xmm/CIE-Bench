      "question": "Do the simplified human figures and the background tent maintain their structural coherence without introducing unnatural geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures are represented in a stylized, abstract manner, using basic geometric shapes to illustrate forms. The background tent and railings also follow this simplistic design. The simplification is intentional and consistent, maintaining structural coherence within the style, without introducing any unexpected or unnatural geometric shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors restricted only to blues, whites, and the man's green shirt, and do they appear natural without introducing any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a restricted color palette mainly of blues, whites, and the bright green of the man's shirt, which is a typical choice in illustrations focusing on color balance and simplicity. The absence of textures aligns with the clean and minimalistic style of the illustration, avoiding any unnatural addition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the text 'SKATE FOR ALL' integrate seamlessly into the upper cloudy sky region without disrupting the natural appearance of the clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text appears in the upper sky region but is fragmented and does not read as 'SKATE FOR ALL.' Instead, it is broken into pieces like 'SKATE/ E R FFI O N,' indicating an attempt to place text but not maintaining coherence. Moreover, there isnâ€™t any depiction of a cloudy sky due to the flat stylized background, which disrupts the seamless integration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the human figures and skateboards maintained realistically, avoiding any distortion or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs abstract shapes to depict human figures and skateboards. The figures are shown with elongated limbs and minimalist features, which aligns with the stylized art style but does not maintain realistic proportions from a naturalistic perspective. Thus, the scaling is intentionally altered for stylistic purposes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the skateboards and clothing been preserved without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fine details of skateboards and clothing are not preserved, as the illustration style favors broad, flat surfaces rather than intricate textures or details. This artistic choice is intentional and matches the simplified and abstract nature of the image.",
