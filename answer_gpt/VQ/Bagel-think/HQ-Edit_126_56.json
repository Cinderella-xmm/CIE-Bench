      "question": "Are the mountain shapes simplified into clear geometric forms without distorted edges or irregular facets that break their structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are rendered using simplified geometric shapes such as triangles and straight lines. There are no distorted edges or irregular facets, as they are drawn with clear, straight lines that maintain consistency in form. These design choices adhere to geometric principles, and the visual cues show uniform angular structures typical of simplified geometric representations, avoiding any break in structural continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the trees retain recognizable silhouettes with consistent geometric proportions and smooth outlines, avoiding fragmented or misshapen branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are depicted with tall, triangular geometric shapes. Their silhouettes are consistent, keeping simple triangular forms without fragmentation or misshapen outlines. Given the use of geometric art style, these forms appropriately represent trees within this artistic context, adhering to the consistent and smooth outlines characteristic of geometric design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the radiating parallel lines in the river aligned with its natural flow direction and spaced uniformly to maintain visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lines that represent the river flow appear to be aligned with the direction of the river, stretching vertically downwards, creating a symmetrical effect as the river splits around the mountains. The spacing between the lines is uniform, maintaining visual continuity and consistent alignment with the design's geometric aesthetic. This symmetrical and aligned portrayal reflects a coherent flow direction typical in geometric abstractions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the reflection in the river perfectly symmetrical to the elements above it, with matching shapes and positions of trees and mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a geometric abstraction where symmetry and reflection are stylized rather than literal. While the riverâ€™s visual elements reflect symmetry in the abstraction style, they do not perfectly match the positions of mountains and trees due to the stylized nature of geometric art where literal reflection isn't the aim. Elements are mirrored in a stylized manner conducive to the geometric context, but not a perfect symmetrical match.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the color block boundaries crisp and clean, with no visible blurring, feathering, or pixelation at the edges of geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uses crisp geometric shapes with solid color blocks. All edges of geometric shapes are clean and distinct, with no visible signs of blurring, feathering, or pixelation. The boundaries between different colors are sharply defined, typical of high-quality geometric art where precision in shape edges is crucial.",
