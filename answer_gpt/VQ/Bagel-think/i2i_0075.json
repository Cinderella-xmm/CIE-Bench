      "question": "Does the fur texture on the side of the cat appear smooth and consistent with the texture on the front part without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur texture is consistently smooth and fluffy throughout the cat's body, including both the front and side regions. The fur appears natural, and there are no visible irregularities or artifacts that would indicate poor editing. This consistency in texture suggests a seamless blending, typical of well-groomed cats with long fur, hence my conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cat's front and side views proportionally aligned without any noticeable distortion or overlapping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, the cat's front and side views align seamlessly with no visible distortion. The proportions of the head, body, and legs are consistent and believable, suggesting careful editing. There are no overlapping artifacts nor signs of disproportion, giving the impression of a naturally captured photograph.",

      "question": "Do the cat's eyes and ears retain their natural shape and detail, free from any visible artifacts or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes and ears are depicted with clarity and detail. The shape of the eyes is almond-like and outlined cleanly, with a clear definition of the eyelids, while the ears maintain their natural triangular shape with visible fur detail. No blurring or artifacts suggest a clean edit, preserving the natural appearance of these features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a continuous and natural transition where the front and side views of the cat meet, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or awkward intersections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a continuous and natural transition between the front and side views of the cat. The lines and contours of the cat's body flow smoothly without any abrupt changes or unnatural intersections, which suggests a well-composed image. There are no visible breaks or awkward meeting points between different perspectives, indicating a coherent and natural image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall posture and positioning of the cat in the combined image remain plausible and natural, without introducing any unnatural bending or stretching of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is positioned in a natural lounging pose, typical for a relaxed cat on a cushioned surface. The limbs are depicted without unnatural bends or stretches, maintaining a believable posture. This natural posture aligns with how cats typically position themselves, without any indications of distortion or poor editing.",
