      "question": "Does the checkmark pathway appear naturally tangled without breaking its geometric integrity or introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the checkmark pathway is overlaid with a red tape motif that contains slogans. While the tape follows the pathway's curvature, the tape's repetitive pattern and text introduction create a visually messy and less streamlined appearance compared to a simple, smooth geometric line. As a result, the geometric integrity feels interrupted, suggesting unnatural artifacts rather than a natural entanglement.",

      "question": "Are the overlapping stamps on the 'We verify your Document' icon visually coherent and free from unnatural textures or excessive clutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'We verify your Document' icon is intersected by a strip of red tape that contains text. The presence of text and pattern on the tape makes the icon appear cluttered and introduces an unnatural texture to the portion where the tape overlaps, resulting in a visually incoherent representation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the red tape motif blend naturally into the orange circular step markers without causing visual disruption or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red tape motif runs through the orange circular step markers, introducing an additional element that doesn't blend seamlessly with the original design. The repeated pattern and color contrast of the tape can cause visual disruption, detracting from the clarity and detail of the original orange markers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the icons and text within the orange circular step markers still legible and structurally consistent after the addition of the red tape motif?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the addition of the red tape running over the orange circular step markers, the icons and text remain clearly visible and legible. The tape does not significantly interfere with the essential elements within the markers, maintaining their structural consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the infographic maintained its clarity and sharpness without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the inclusion of a red tape motif adds a new layer over the original design, which introduces additional textures and patterns absent in Image A. This inclusion results in a perceived loss of clarity and introduces unnatural textures that could distract from the infographic's original sharpness and fine details.",
