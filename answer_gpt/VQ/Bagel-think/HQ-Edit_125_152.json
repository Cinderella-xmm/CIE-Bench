      "question": "Are the sheet music patterns integrated into the wingâ€™s orange sections without breaking the natural vein lines or causing visible texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheet music patterns are placed over the orange sections of the butterfly's wing. Upon close inspection, it is evident that these patterns are ingeniously integrated, maintaining the general structure and alignment with the natural veins of the wing. The text does not seem to break or disrupt the vein lines significantly, and there are no obvious texture artifacts that interfere with the visual coherence of the wing. The integration looks intentional and seamless, suggesting a deliberate design choice.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the antennae extend from the head in a smooth, continuous curve without unnatural kinks, breaks, or disproportionate length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The antennae in Image B appear to extend smoothly from the head of the butterfly, following a gentle and continuous curve. There are no evident kinks or breaks, and they do not appear disproportionately long compared to typical butterfly antennae. This smooth curvature is consistent with how antennae are naturally expected to appear, indicating a natural integration within the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the petal shapes of the newly added flowers formed like musical notes but still maintain natural curvature and thickness consistent with real petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are flowers surrounding the butterfly that do not explicitly display petal shapes resembling musical notes. The petals generally maintain a natural curvature and thickness similar to what one would expect from real flowers. There is no obvious formation that mimics musical note shapes; instead, the flowers seem to serve as a decorative border around the butterfly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the butterfly and surrounding flowers arranged in a balanced circular pattern where each element appears at a plausible distance and angle relative to the others?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a butterfly centrally placed among a series of flowers, arranged in what can be interpreted as a visually balanced circular pattern. The elements (butterfly and flowers) are distributed evenly, with plausible spacing and angles relative to each other. This arrangement promotes visual symmetry and balance, often seen in decorative artistic compositions, suggesting intentional design to create harmony within the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title text rendered with smooth, continuous strokes and no visible aliasing or jagged edges along the letterforms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title text in Image B is crafted with elaborate calligraphic styling. Upon inspection, each letterform appears to be rendered with smooth strokes, exhibiting no visible aliasing or jagged edges. This smoothness ensures that the text maintains a polished and professional look, enhancing the elegance and readability of the title within the image context.",
