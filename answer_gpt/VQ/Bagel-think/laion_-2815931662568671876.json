      "question": "Does the monocle added to the tortilla chip maintain a consistent size and shape relative to the chip, and is it seamlessly integrated without visible artifacts or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tortilla chip has been illustrated with a monocle positioned on what could be considered its 'face' area. The monocle maintains a constant size relative to the 'eye' of the tortilla chip character, appearing coherent and proportionate. Its shape remains circular and it is drawn with consistent lines. The monocle is integrated smoothly into the design of the chip character and does not exhibit any visible artifacts or unnatural shading, preserving the artistic and humorous style of the cartoon.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hand-like appendage attached to the guacamole mound proportionally sized and shaped like a realistic hand, with no more than five fingers and natural joint lines, and does it appear to emerge naturally from the guacamole without breaking its texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guacamole mound includes a creatively drawn appendage meant to resemble an arm with a hand-like appearance. This appendage does not strictly adhere to realistic proportions or anatomical correctness, as it lacks detailed joint lines or individual fingers. Instead, it fits within the cartoon's whimsical style. The arm appears to emerge from the guacamole in a stylized fashion, consistent with its humorous and playful visual theme. The texture of the guacamole transitions naturally around the arm, maintaining coherence in the scene.",

      "question": "Is the spice rack positioned behind the tortilla chip in a way that respects perspective and shadow direction, and does it blend naturally with the existing background without visible seams or color mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no spice rack visible within the cartoon setting; instead, the guacamole and tortilla chip characters are positioned in a fantasy-like environment. Thus, there is no issue of perspective or shadow direction related to a spice rack, and the question does not apply.",

      "question": "Are the mini flag banners aligned horizontally and evenly spaced above the table, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with the light source, without appearing flat or digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrated scene includes mini flag banners above the table. These banners appear aligned horizontally and are evenly spaced, contributing to an organized visual layout. Their placement shows signs of intentional design with respect to the scene's perspective. Although shadows aren't heavily pronounced, the banners do not look flat or digitally pasted, as they conform to the stylized, cartoonish aesthetic safeguarding the ambiance of the fantasy setting.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the colors of the tortilla chip and guacamole been adjusted to pastel shades without losing their inherent textures or becoming unnaturally pale or washed out, maintaining visual credibility as edible items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the tortilla chip and guacamole maintain their natural appearance without switching to pastel shades. The tortilla chip retains its typical reddish-brown texture, which is consistent with baked tortilla chips, and the guacamole holds a vivid green hue representative of fresh avocado. While the cartoon styling may exaggerate some aspects for comedic effect, the food itemsâ€™ colors remain credible for edible representation.",
