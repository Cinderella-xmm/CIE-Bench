      "question": "Does the seaside café tabletop setting blend naturally with the table surface, avoiding any noticeable break in texture or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table and the overall seaside café setup appear to have a consistent wood grain and color. The lighting on the tabletop matches the lighting conditions suggested by the sunlight reflections and the bright outdoor environment, reducing any noticeable breaks in texture or lighting. There is no abrupt change in the surface that seems out of place, suggesting that the tabletop setting blends naturally with the surrounding elements.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the shapes and proportions of sea waves and sunlight reflections accurately depicted, maintaining structural consistency without unnatural breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sea waves in Image B have a consistent size and shape that typically represents real ocean waves. Sunlight reflections create bright, small spots across the waves, which is a common visual effect. There are no distortions or abrupt shifts in the wave formations that would make them appear unnatural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the materials of the seaside elements, such as the table, sea waves, and sunlight reflections, appear authentic, free from unnatural textures and visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The table in Image B shows a wooden texture that seems realistic with appropriate reflections. The sea waves reflect sunlight, giving a typical shimmering effect. Both elements closely resemble real-life scenarios and are free from obvious visual artifacts that would suggest otherwise.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sunlight reflections on the sea waves consistent with the sun's expected position, maintaining physical logic and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunlight reflections on the sea are aligned with the angle of sunlight that is expected from the sun's position over the horizon. The reflections stretch horizontally across the water’s surface, a typical behavior when the sun is relatively low in the sky.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the seaside café setting fit naturally on the tabletop, enhancing the image's visual coherence without introducing distracting or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout of the café with the table seamlessly fits the scene presented. The outdoor setting transitions smoothly into the beach environment, and all objects appear to have proper placement and proportion, avoiding any visual disruption or misplaced elements. Therefore, the image maintains good visual coherence.",
