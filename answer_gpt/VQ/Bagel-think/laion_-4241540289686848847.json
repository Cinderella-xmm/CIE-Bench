        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's long silver hair is visually analyzed. It appears to flow naturally without any visible clumping or floating. There are no seams or rendering artifacts noticeable, which indicates high-quality animation or rendering. The hair falls smoothly, likely due to sophisticated design techniques. Such observations suggest that the hair is well-integrated into the image, reflecting natural movement and style.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the background of Image B, there are scrolls and potions positioned logically within a laboratory setting.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows of the character are consistent with the direction of the light source as suggested by the laboratory background setting. There are no floating or disconnected elements visible, such as misplaced objects or unattached textures. This indicates careful integration of the character with the background and proper adjustments to the lighting and shadowing effects.",
