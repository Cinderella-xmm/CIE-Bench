    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the spaceship retain a coherent circular shape with consistent proportions, and are the added circular motifs and meander patterns aligned symmetrically without warping or overlapping irregularly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spaceship maintains a circular shape, but the added motifs and patterns on its surface appear distorted and lack symmetry. The circular motifs do not align properly, creating an irregular appearance due to the overlapping patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the painted patterns on the spaceshipâ€™s surface free from digital artifacts, such as jagged edges, unnatural brushstroke textures, or inconsistent color gradients that suggest poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the patterns on the spaceship's surface exhibit jagged edges and inconsistent brushstroke textures. These digital artifacts suggest that the rendering of the patterns on the spaceship is not smooth and exhibits signs of poor digital processing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the abstract wave forms in the landscape below continuous and smoothly curved, avoiding sharp breaks or abrupt transitions that disrupt the flow of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wave forms in the landscape do not flow continuously and smoothly. There are abrupt transitions and breaks in the patterns that disrupt the seamless flow of the design, suggesting a lack of continuity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the colors in the transformed landscape consist exclusively of muted earth tones (e.g., browns, tans, dark reds) without any bright or out-of-place colors like neon greens or electric blues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features abstract patterns in the landscape with predominant muted earth tones such as browns and tans. However, there are also some bright blues within the wave patterns, suggesting the presence of out-of-place colors inconsistent with the earth tone palette.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the edited spaceship positioned at a consistent altitude above the abstract landscape, with proper perspective alignment relative to the curved railway tracks below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spaceship appears to float at a consistent altitude above the abstract landscape. Although the patterns are distorted, the relative positioning and alignment above the curved railway tracks suggest proper perspective placement.",
