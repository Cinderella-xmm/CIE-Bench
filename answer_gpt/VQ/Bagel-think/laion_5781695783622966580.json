    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the hat symmetrical and aligned with the brim and crown, without jagged edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric patterns on the hat are visually striking with distinct shapes that follow the general structure of the hat's brim and crown. Upon close inspection, these patterns appear consistently aligned across the hat without visible jagged edges or interruptions. The continuous and smooth design suggests careful placement and alignment, supporting the conclusion that they are symmetrical and neatly aligned.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the brim follow the contour of the hat and reflect light naturally, without appearing as flat or detached patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold accents are positioned along the brim of the hat. They appear to follow the brim's contours smoothly, indicating an intentional design meant to integrate with the hat's structure. The way they interact with the light gives them a natural reflective quality rather than appearing flat or unrealistic, suggesting these accents are cohesively designed with the hat.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the turquoise, cream, and silver motifs smoothly blended into the fabric, without abrupt color shifts or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors turquoise, cream, and silver are visually integrated into the geometric patterns present on the hat. The blending of these colors appears smooth, without noticeable abrupt shifts or pixelation that might indicate poor integration or editing. The continuity in color suggests a deliberate and consistent design process, leading to the conclusion that the motifs are seamlessly blended.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the patterns on the hat avoid intersecting or distorting the natural wave and volume of the hair, maintaining clear separation between the two?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric patterns on the hat maintain a distinct boundary from the visible hair strands. The natural wave and volume of the hair are evident, and no part of the pattern seems to intrude upon or distort the natural outline of the hair. This indicates a clear separation between the hat's design and the hair.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the shape of the hatâ€™s brim and crown preserved with consistent thickness and curvature, without visible warping or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat maintains its shape with a consistent look in both the brim and crown. The curvature and thickness appear uniform, and there are no visible signs of warping or deformation that might arise from poorly executed design or editing. The overall structure is consistent, indicating the hat's shape has been preserved.",
