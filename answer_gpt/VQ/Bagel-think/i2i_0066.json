      "question": "Do the 3D printed display model and display plaque appear naturally integrated into the image, without disrupting the scene’s overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To assess the natural integration of the 3D printed model and display plaque in Image B, I examine how well they fit within the scene contextually and visually. The lighting, shadows, and placement should be consistent with the surrounding environment—a tech expo booth. The model and plaque do not appear out of place and fit into the scene without disruptions, suggesting a realistic integration with the background and setting.",

      "question": "Does the texture of the 3D printed model resemble matte PLA plastic realistically, without showing any unnatural surface irregularities or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the model in Image B needs to exhibit characteristics typically expected of matte PLA plastic, such as smoothness and uniformity without notable artifacts. The texture looks even and clean, akin to standard PLA 3D printing, and visual cues like consistent lighting and color demonstrate an absence of irregularities, supporting a realistic representation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the display plaque at the base positioned correctly, maintaining structural consistency and contributing to the visual credibility of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For structural consistency, the plaque must align properly with the tabletop and not appear misaligned or floating. Observations show it is well-positioned, with no apparent discrepancies in perspective or scale relative to the surrounding elements. It fits structurally within the scene's framework, enhancing credibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the transition between the original elements and the new tech expo booth background appear seamless, avoiding any obvious artifacts or unnatural segmentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, transitions should be smooth and cohesive. The background change to a tech expo booth interacts seamlessly with the original elements present. Attention to lighting and visual effects contributes to an unobtrusive merger between elements, showing no segmentation or artifacts.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the 3D printed model and the display plaque realistic and consistent with what one would expect in a real-world scenario, avoiding any noticeable distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Realism requires the model and plaque proportions to be plausible in physical dimensions suitable for display purposes. The relative size aligns well with typical display conventions, without any obvious distortion or proportional discrepancy. The scale aligns with typical human dimensions, reinforcing a realistic scene.",
