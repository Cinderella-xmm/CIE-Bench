      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the aircraft have smooth, clear surfaces without visible distortion, scratches, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a glass display case surrounding the aircraft. Upon inspection, the surfaces appear smooth and clear, with no visible distortions or imperfections. The reflections are minimal and consistent with the lighting environment. World knowledge about glass properties, which typically involve smoothness and transparency, supports the conclusion that the glass is presented in an ideal state.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leather accents and brass corners attached to the display case with accurate material textures, proper lighting response, and no visible seams or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leather and brass elements attached to the display case show detailed textures. Leather exhibits grain patterns and subtle variations in light intensity, while brass displays a metallic sheen with highlights and shadows indicative of proper lighting response. These elements appear securely attached without seams or floating effects, aligning with world knowledge of high-quality material rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the engraved emblem on the front of the display case clearly defined with appropriate depth and shadowing, and does it blend naturally into the glass surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The emblem in Image B is positioned on the front of the display case. It is intricately engraved, with visible depth and shadowing consistent with realistic light behavior on embossed surfaces. The emblem appears to blend seamlessly into the wooden frame rather than the glass, and given the consistent rendering of such elements, it's concluded the emblem fits the context naturally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature clouds positioned inside the glass case, visually separated from the aircraft, and rendered with soft, volumetric textures without clipping or unnatural transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds inside the display case are depicted with soft, volumetric textures, resembling cushioned formations. They are visibly separated from the aircraft in the spatial arrangement and possess consistent opacity, indicating no clipping or unrealistic transparency. World knowledge of cloud depiction in digital models supports this analysis, as they appear properly rendered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the propellers depicted with rotational motion blur and properly aligned with the engine nacelles, without deformation or clipping against the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the aircraft's propellers with visual indication of motion blur, suggesting rotational movement. The alignment with the engine nacelles is precise and seamless, displaying no clipping or deformation against the display case. This accuracy is supported by knowledge of aircraft dynamics and image rendering techniques that effectively portray mechanical parts in motion.",
