    "Question": "Q1: Does the surface of the piano exhibit a uniform caramel color with visible white and gold icing details that resemble real edible decoration, without unnatural textures or digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the piano has a surface with a uniform caramel color, resembling gingerbread. This is complemented by white icing used for decorative patterns typical of gingerbread houses. The gold details on the legs appear as painted accents matching edible decorations seen in confectionery. Natural textures that mimic baked goods are visible, with no evident digital artifacts disrupting the perception of an actual gingerbread creation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the proportions and spatial relationships of the piano’s components (lid, body, legs, pedals) preserved and correctly aligned, with no visible deformation or geometric distortion?",
    "explanation": "Image B carefully retains the proportions and spatial relationships between the piano's components. The lid, body, legs, and pedals are arranged and shaped in a manner consistent with a traditional grand piano model, although they are stylized to resemble gingerbread. There’s no apparent distortion in terms of geometry, maintaining symmetry and coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the color transition from black to caramel seamless, with soft gradients and natural light interaction that matches the lighting in the room?",
    "explanation": "Based on Image B, there isn't a transition from black to caramel to assess. The image displays a fully caramel-colored piano with icing details, and its lighting is consistent with indoor conditions typical of product photography rather than room lighting effects. Therefore, the question about transitions does not apply here.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the keys appear as distinct, uniformly shaped sugar crystals arranged in a regular pattern along the keyboard, with no missing or misaligned elements?",
    "explanation": "The keyboard in Image B is decorated with rows of white icing that aim to represent piano keys. These icing keys appear uniformly shaped and neatly aligned, similar in layout to real piano keys, with no misalignments or missing elements noticeable.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the white marble tabletop beneath the piano flat, properly scaled, and displaying natural stone patterns and shadows that align with the light source above?",
    "explanation": "The white marble tabletop in Image B gives an impression of a flat surface, with visible natural stone veining patterns. The scale appears appropriate for displaying the gingerbread piano. However, there is no direct evidence of how light interacts with it in terms of shadows in relation to a light source above.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all edges of the piano and its decorative elements sharp and clean, with no visible pixelation, smudging, or unnatural blending at boundaries?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the piano's edges and its decorative icing details as sharp and well-defined, without pixelation or smudging. This clean definition enhances the realism of the gingerbread-like appearance, with boundaries distinct rather than blended or unclear.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the shadows cast by the piano onto the marble table match the light direction from the chandelier and appear soft and naturally diffused?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not clearly display shadows cast by the piano consistent with a chandelier or any particular light source. Given the context—an isolated studio-like setting—the soft shadow direction and diffusion aren’t observable as they might be in a larger room setting like Image A. The lighting appears consistent with product photography that minimizes visible shadows on or around the object.",
    "answer": "No"
