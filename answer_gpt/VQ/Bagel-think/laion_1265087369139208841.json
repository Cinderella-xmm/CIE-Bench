    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the crystal orb surrounding the castle have clean, unbroken edges without visible distortion or bending of the castle’s structure inside it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a crystal orb containing a castle. The edges of the orb appear smooth and intact, without visible distortions or irregularities. The castle inside appears proportionate and unaltered by any optical distortion, suggesting that the orb accurately contains the castle with clean boundaries.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the clouds positioned above the castle without overlapping or clipping through any architectural elements, and do they have soft, natural-looking edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, clouds are shown floating above the castle within the orb. They do not intersect or clip through the structure of the castle. The clouds also have softly rounded, fluffy edges, suggesting a natural appearance without harsh lines.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vines climb the castle walls from the bottom upward, following the wall contours without breaking the stone texture or appearing to float in mid-air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, vines appear to climb the structure from the base upwards, adhering to the contour lines of the castle’s walls. They do not look like they are floating in any area or breaking through the stonework texture, which reflects a natural integration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gem-like flowers placed within the garden beds at a natural scale, with no excessive glare or repeating textures that indicate artificial rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flowers within Image B appear as gem-like elements located at the base of the castle. They are proportionate in size compared to the other elements and lack any excessive glare or noticeable repeating patterns that would suggest artificiality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dragon positioned on a stable part of the central tower, proportionally small compared to the structure, and casting a shadow aligned with the ambient light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a dragon element. Since the question refers to a non-existent feature in the edited image, the question does not apply.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the gold base lie flush with the ground, extend evenly under the castle, and show consistent engraved patterns without jagged edges or texture errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold base in Image B appears evenly placed, supporting the crystal orb and castle uniformly. The engraved patterns are consistent and smooth, without visible jagged edges or discrepancies in texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all added elements (orb, clouds, vines, dragon, flowers, base) structurally coherent with the original castle, showing no broken lines, floating components, or conflicting lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, elements such as the orb, clouds, vines, flowers, and base are structurally consistent and coherent with the castle, with no indications of broken lines or floating parts. The dragon, being absent, does not impact structural coherence, and the elements demonstrate a unified lighting scheme.",
