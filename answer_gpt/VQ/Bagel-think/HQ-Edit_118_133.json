      "question": "Does the surface of the teapotâ€™s body exhibit a consistent, smooth high-gloss ceramic finish without visible texture artifacts or abrupt transitions from the original metallic look?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot's body appears to have a smooth and consistent surface with a high-gloss finish typical of ceramic materials.

      "question": "Is the wick positioned at the tip of the former spout location in a straight, vertical orientation that aligns naturally with the candle design, without bending or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the presence of a wick emerging from the top of the teapot, indicative of a candle design, rather than from the former spout location.

      "question": "Is the handle now rendered as a solid gold-colored accent with no visible remnants of the original wood or metal, and does it retain its original curvature without warping or unnatural thickness changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle exhibits a gold-colored finish, completely replacing the wood or metallic appearance of Image A.

      "question": "Are the floral patterns around the base of the teapot evenly spaced, proportionally scaled, and stylistically consistent with the existing engraved motifs, without overlapping or distorting the base structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the teapot now has a sleek, plain appearance without the floral engravings seen in Image A. Therefore, there are no floral patterns to evaluate for spacing or consistency with any motifs.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Eternal Elegance Candle\" placed centrally on the front face of the teapot in a flowing script font that matches the luxury theme, with no pixelation, shadowing, or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is text placed centrally on the front face of the teapot, but it reads 'Liumne Faurte Lautre' instead of 'Eternal Elegance Candle.' The font is flowing and matches the luxurious theme, but the content does not align with the specified text. There are no visible pixelation, shadowing, or clipping artifacts.",
