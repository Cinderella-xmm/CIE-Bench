        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the velvet robe appears to have realistic fabric folds, suggesting its heaviness and thickness.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden shelves are aligned well, showing uniform depth and angle, which maintains the structural integrity of the bookcase. The books on the shelves, while colored differently than Image A, have consistent spine thickness and portray realistic aging effects like slight wear and shadows that complement the overall lighting scheme, enhancing the image's authenticity.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the inkstand is placed in an appropriate position on the armrest surface, creating a soft shadow that aligns with the perceived light source from the candles. The inkstand's metallic properties are depicted with adequate reflective qualities, matching the surrounding environment and enhancing the image's realism, preventing it from looking flat or artificial.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warm light source from the candles casts soft gradients over the entire scene, creating smooth transitions. It highlights the golden embroidery effectively and produces gentle shadows beneath the arms. The lighting is consistent, exhibiting no abrupt brightness transitions, maintaining an even illumination that enhances the overall atmosphere.",
