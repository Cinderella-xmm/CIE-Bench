    "Question": "Q1: Do the exaggerated muscles on the athleteâ€™s arms, shoulders, and abdomen follow natural anatomical contours without introducing unnatural bulges or broken shapes?",
    "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) illustrates exaggerated musculature on the athlete. The muscles appear to follow the natural anatomical contours, as they align with the common knowledge of muscle groups: biceps, triceps, shoulders, and abdominal rows. However, in some exaggerated edits, unnatural bulges or broken shapes can be introduced if the lines, shadows, or proportions do not align with human anatomy. In this image, despite the exaggeration, the rendering maintains recognizable shapes and contours that mimic real human muscular anatomy, indicating they follow these contours well.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the fiery red gloves with gold accents visually consistent in material texture and color, with no visible seams, pixelation, or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the fiery red gloves with gold accents have been designed with vibrant color and texture. The material of the gloves appears smooth and consistent, suggesting the sheen of leather or synthetic boxing gloves. There are no visible seams or pixelation, and the highlights on the gloves are consistent with a glossy finish, which suggests they maintain consistent material texture and color without any artificial-looking elements.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the strobe lights in the background evenly distributed and consistent in direction and intensity, without creating unnatural shadows or light leaks?",
    "explanation": "The background of Image B shows strobe lights designed to appear as spotlights in an arena setting. These lights are evenly distributed across the background and show consistent direction and intensity. The highlights on the athlete align with the positions of the strobe lights, creating realistic shadows pertinent to the scene's dynamics, without evident light leaks or inconsistencies in luminance.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the blank motivational quote panel aligned with the perspective of the scene and does it have consistent lighting and shadowing to appear as if part of the environment?",
    "explanation": "The blank motivational quote panel in the edited image is positioned vertically to the left of the central figure. The alignment follows the perspective lines that would be consistent with a boxing ring's surroundings. The lighting on the panel seems congruent with the scene's overall light direction, and any shadows cast are consistent with the rest of the environment, implying it is integrated into the scene without standing out unnaturally.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the composition balanced and framed appropriately so that the central figure and key elements (gloves, stance, lighting) remain clear and undistorted when scaled for print?",
    "explanation": "The edited image shows a well-framed composition where the central figure is prominently placed, with a dynamic stance highlighting the red gloves. The elements are proportionate and symmetrically aligned, suggesting they will remain clear and undistorted upon scaling. The lighting complements the athlete by emphasizing key features and maintaining clarity in the main focal points, ensuring the composition's integrity is maintained for print.",
    "answer": "Yes"
