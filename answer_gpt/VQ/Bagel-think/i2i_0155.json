      "question": "Does the addition of 'Breathe' at the top left corner blend naturally with the image without introducing any visible artifacts or disrupting the plant's structural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Breathe' is positioned in the top left corner of Image B. It is placed against the dark background on the left side of the image. Based purely on Image B, it appears that the text does not introduce any visible artifacts such as pixelation or blurriness, nor does it disrupt the structural appearance of the plant, as it is positioned away from the plant. Given this placement, the text seems to integrate well with the overall image without causing any visual issues.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the inclusion of 'Calm' at the bottom right corner naturally integrated into the scene, ensuring that the window frame's geometry remains intact and visually plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From observing Image B, the word 'Calm' is added at the bottom right corner near the window frame. It is placed in the empty space and avoids interference with the window frame's geometry. There are no alterations or distortions in the window frame visible in the image, which suggests the text is naturally integrated without affecting the structure of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the light reflections and shadows on the leaves natural and consistent with the lighting source, unaffected by the added text 'Breathe' and 'Calm'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light reflections and shadows on the leaves remain consistent with the lighting coming from the window. The text 'Breathe' and 'Calm' do not interfere with the visual appearance of these lighting effects. The text is placed on areas outside the region occupied by the leaves, and the lighting remains consistent with what would be expected from sunlight filtering through the window, unaffected by text additions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the texture details of the terracotta pot and its saucer remain authentic and detailed, with no degradation or introduction of unnatural textures due to the addition of text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the texture details of the terracotta pot and its saucer remain unchanged and authentic. This region appears unaffected by the text, as the text does not overlap or interfere with the pot and saucer. The textures appear natural with proper visual detail intact.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the positioning of 'Breathe' and 'Calm' preserved the plant's form and the window's symmetry, avoiding any distortion or disruption in proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of 'Breathe' and 'Calm' ensures that both the plant's form and the window's symmetry are preserved. The text is strategically placed in the periphery areas, which prevents any distortion or disruption to the proportions of the plant or the window's symmetrical appearance. This thoughtful placement ensures that the overall composition remains unaffected.",
