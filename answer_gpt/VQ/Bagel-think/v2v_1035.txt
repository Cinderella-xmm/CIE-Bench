    "Question": "Q1: Do the Russian nesting dolls maintain the recognizable shape and proportions of the giraffe without introducing unnatural geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "The Russian nesting dolls in Image B are designed to resemble giraffes, with exaggerated and stylized features typical of such decorative items. They maintain a recognizable giraffe shape with a long neck, ears, and spots, while adapting a cuter and more whimsical appearance. The shapes are smooth and rounded, consistent with chibi or cartoon-like representations rather than realistic depictions. This does not introduce unnatural geometric distortions given the artistic style. Therefore, within the context of their intended design, the proportions are maintained.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the textures on the Russian nesting dolls consistent with the giraffe's fur pattern, avoiding unnatural or overly smooth surfaces?",
    "explanation": "The nesting dolls exhibit a smooth surface with painted spots that mimic a giraffe's fur pattern. While the texture is different from a real giraffe's coarse fur due to the material likely being ceramic or porcelain, the design effectively uses color and pattern to recall the appearance of a giraffe without making the surface appear overly unnatural given the usual smoothness of such items.",
    "answer": "Yes"

Each doll, from largest to smallest, smoothly transitions in size with clean lines and consistent design proportions.

All dolls appear to have a stable base and do not overlap each other or exhibit any signs of floating.

There is a uniform distribution of light, avoiding overexposed highlights or harsh dark areas, and the shadows appear natural for an indoor setting.
