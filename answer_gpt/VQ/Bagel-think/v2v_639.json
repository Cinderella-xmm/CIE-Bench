      "question": "Are the LEGO minifigures of the person and giraffe free from unnatural textures and maintain their structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO minifigures of the person and giraffe exhibit the expected smooth and consistent textures characteristic of LEGO pieces. This is achieved through uniform color application and precise edges, which maintain the structural coherence of the objects. LEGO minifigures typically have standardized design details, which are evident in the seamless joints and smooth surfaces seen here.",

      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the LEGO minifigures appear undamaged and structurally consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The geometric shapes of the LEGO minifigures in Image B appear undamaged and structurally consistent. This observation is based on the uniformity of their joints and the symmetry in their construction, which LEGO designs are known for. The minute details such as the distinct rectangular shapes of the body and curved surfaces are intact, indicating no structural damage.",

      "question": "Does the transparent glass cube enclosing the LEGO scene look natural and free from obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transparent glass cube in Image B enclosing the LEGO scene appears natural and without obvious artifacts. This conclusion comes from the clear visibility of the contents within the cube without distortion, which suggests smooth surfaces and well-rendered reflections, common in high-quality transparent materials.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting in the scene properly highlight the intricate details of the LEGO minifigures and the glass cube without causing any distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B highlights the intricate details effectively, as seen through the distinct features of the minifigures and the reflections on the glass cube. The lighting does not cause any noticeable distortions or glare, allowing for clarity in viewing the individual features of the scene, which is indicative of controlled and skillful light manipulation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the gradient background complement the scene's earthy and natural tones without introducing unnatural textures or loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gradient background in Image B complements the scene's tones by providing a subtle transition that maintains focus on the natural hues present. This background does not introduce any distracting textures or lead to a loss of detail in the foreground elements, which indicates an appropriate choice that enhances rather than detracts from the scene's visual integrity.",
