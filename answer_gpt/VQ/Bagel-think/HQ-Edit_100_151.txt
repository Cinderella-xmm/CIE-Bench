    "Question": "Q5: Is the calendar grid positioned at ground level and aligned with the path beneath the child, without floating or casting unrealistic shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar grid is located near the bottom in front of the child. However, it contains pegs, which imply a hanging mechanism, giving the impression that it may not be directly affixed to the ground. This positioning does not disrupt ground alignment severely but hints at elevation above the path, thus failing to fully respect ground-level alignment.",
    "answer": "No"
