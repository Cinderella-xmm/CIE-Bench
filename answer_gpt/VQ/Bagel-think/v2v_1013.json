      "question": "Do the anime-style models of the birds retain their full body postures, feather textures, and coloration accurately without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds are represented in an anime style, which inherently applies a stylization that might not fully replicate realistic detail. The anime-style adapts certain features like shape, posture, and color but simulates feathers with a more simplified, artistic form, which while aesthetically pleasing, introduces some unnatural artifacts compared to realistic birds. The full posture and major coloration are retained but with stylized features, indicating some departure from realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fine details and textures of the birds' feathers preserved in the anime-style models without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feathers are illustrated with simplified strokes typical of anime styles, which do not capture the minute details and textures seen in real feathers like in Image A. This stylization results in a loss of intricate detail inherent in realistic depictions, where individual feathers might be observable. Hence, the fine details are not preserved.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transition from realistic birds to anime-style models introduce any unnatural textures or degrade the fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts birds with a smooth and continuous style, characteristic of anime art, replacing the layered and complex feather textures seen in Image A. This transition simplifies textures and degrades the detailed feather structures, introducing a more uniform surface that does not mimic natural appearances.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical rationality of the birds' bodies remain consistent and credible in the anime-style models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the anime style exaggerates certain features for visual appeal, the general proportions of the birds remain consistent with typical bird anatomy, such as head size relative to body and placement of wings. Unlike realistic detailing, this style leans towards a credible representation, albeit simplified.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement of the anime-style bird models on a desktop captured from a casual snapshot perspective look authentic and natural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to place the birds on a branch in a stylized environment rather than juxtaposed against a natural, realistic desktop setting. The lack of environment detail and framing suggests the positioning is within an anime context rather than a real-world snapshot, lacking authentic placement indications.",
