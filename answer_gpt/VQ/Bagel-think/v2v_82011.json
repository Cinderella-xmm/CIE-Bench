      "question": "Do the bold calligraphic outlines and flat planes of color on the dolls' clothing and hair maintain the original proportions and positions without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bold calligraphic outlines and flat planes of color are stylistically typical of Ukiyo-e, which uses such features to represent figures without distorting their essential shapes or proportions. The dolls' clothing and hair appear consistent with their original proportions when compared to Image A, maintaining a uniformity without any unnatural alterations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the dolls' skin and hair free from unnatural artifacts and maintain a natural appearance after the style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs an artistic style where textures are rendered in a flat, illustrative manner typical of Ukiyo-e art. While this approach reduces details, it does not introduce artifacts but rather supports stylistic uniformity, maintaining the dolls' skin and hair in a coherent, natural appearance aligned with the artistic motif. This depiction is without unnatural artifacts given the artistic context.",

      "question": "Do the dolls' limbs and facial features retain their structural integrity and do not appear deformed after the style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing Image B to Image A, the dolls' limbs and facial features in Image B remain structurally intact and proportionally correct, consistent with their original representation. The Ukiyo-e style adapts these elements without deforming them, preserving their structural integrity despite changes in texture and detailing.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the subtly patterned, simplified background complement the dolls without disrupting the visual flow and maintaining the overall sense of reality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B uses patterns and simplifications inherent to Ukiyo-e art, which often employs stylized depictions of natural or minimalistic scenes to complement the primary subjects. This approach maintains visual cohesion and supports the dolls' presentation, without disrupting flow or the sense of reality as interpreted within the Ukiyo-e style framework.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dolls' poses and expressions remain coherent with the original scene and contribute to the visual credibility of the Ukiyo-e style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls' poses and expressions are consistent with their original positions from Image A, preserving coherence with the scene despite the stylization. The Ukiyo-e transformation adapts these elements without altering their essence, ensuring that their credibility in the scene is maintained, visually aligning with the typical narrative style of Ukiyo-e art.",
