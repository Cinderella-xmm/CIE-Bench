    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the arms and face drawn on the pie’s surface consistent with the texture and color of the crust, without visible digital artifacts or mismatched shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible arms or face drawn directly on the pie’s surface. Instead, the pie with a lattice pattern resembles the item from Image A but now appears in a comic-style format with dialogue bubbles and a knife. There is no indication of added elements such as arms or a face on the pie itself. Hence, no inconsistency or digital artifacts from such additions are present.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lattice pattern retain its original grid structure and spacing, and does it appear as a draped fabric apron without broken or stretched lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the pie does not have a visible lattice pattern indicative of a draped fabric apron. Instead, it features a different criss-cross pattern more typical of a classic pie crust design. This pattern appears intact without any indication of being a fabric structure.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the knife converted into a feather pen with a realistic quill tip and wooden shaft, and does it maintain a natural transition from the original knife shape without abrupt edges or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife from Image A is unchanged into a feather pen. It remains a traditional knife with a metal blade and a wooden handle, showing no signs of conversion into a quill. Thus, there is no transformation to assess for abrupt edges or mismatched textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the additional pastries positioned at a consistent distance and scale relative to the main pie, and do they cast realistic shadows and reflect the same lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no additional pastries present alongside the main pie. The image consists solely of a single pie displayed on a table with dialogue bubbles surrounding it. Hence, there are no additional elements to evaluate for consistency in positioning, shadow casting, or lighting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the text bubbles positioned close to the pie’s mouth, legible, and free from overlapping or clipping with the pie or plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubbles in Image B are positioned relatively close to the pie and do not intersect or overlap with the pie or its plate. However, the text within the bubbles appears scrambled or mirrored, making it difficult to read clearly. Although this format might be a stylistic choice, it impacts legibility.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the hands on the pie have exactly five fingers each, proper joint alignment, and a natural grip on the feather pen without deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a single hand is visible on the pie holding a knife, not a feather pen. This hand correctly displays five fingers, including a thumb, which appear properly aligned and with a natural grip on the knife handle, indicating no deformities or extra digits.",
