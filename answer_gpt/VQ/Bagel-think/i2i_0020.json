      "question": "Are the red-and-gray train and STOP sign geometrically simplified without introducing distorted or broken shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train and STOP sign have been simplified to basic geometric shapes such as rectangles and circles. The shapes maintain their structural integrity and do not exhibit any distortion or breakage, which is crucial for a clean and coherent minimalist design. The STOP sign retains its octagonal shape, and the train remains consistently linear, both of which are essential characteristics for these objects.",

      "question": "Do the green mountain outlines and track lines look naturally integrated and consistent with the cool-toned minimalist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the mountains as simple geometric peaks in green, which complements the overall minimalist aesthetic. The track lines are shown as bold, black lines, providing a stark contrast that aligns with the simple style. These elements together create a harmonious and consistent look that fits well with the minimalist and cool-toned design, contributing to an integrated scene.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the textures of the simplified train and STOP sign been maintained well enough to avoid loss of essential details and unnatural appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train and STOP sign are depicted using flat colors and shapes, typical in minimalist design. While this style naturally reduces texture complexity, it effectively maintains essential details like the train's windows and the STOP sign's lettering, ensuring a clear representation without appearing unnatural. The essence of these objects is preserved through their simplified forms.",

      "question": "Does the minimalist illustration maintain the correct spatial relationship between the train, STOP sign, and tracks without disrupting visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial arrangement of the train, STOP sign, and track lines is clear. The elements maintain their relative positions with respect to each other, with the train on the tracks and the STOP sign positioned beside them. This preserves the logical visual relationship and narrative of a train at a stopping point, ensuring credibility in the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cool-toned color palette remain consistent throughout the minimalist illustration, effectively supporting the traffic safety visual style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a consistent color palette of reds, grays, greens, and blacks, forming a cool-toned minimalist style. The dominant red and gray on the train aligns with typical traffic safety colors, while the green and black on the mountain and tracks provide balance and contrast. This consistency in color selection supports the focus on traffic safety, making the design coherent and effective.",
