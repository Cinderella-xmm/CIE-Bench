      "question": "Does the kitten's body appear structurally consistent without any unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parts of the kitten's body that are visible—particularly its ears and paws—show no signs of distortion or unnatural artifacts. The left ear is clear and sharp, and the visible part of the paws, resting on the blanket, appear proportionate and natural. There is no indication of structural inconsistencies in these areas.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fur details around the kitten’s face natural and free from any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fur details visible on the kitten's ears in Image B appear textured and well-defined without any unnatural patterns or significant loss of detail, indicating a realistic appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the kitten's position and perspective accurately simulate a 3D jumps-out effect without breaking its geometric shapes or distorting its proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visible parts of the kitten in Image B, the positioning appears natural. The ear and paws maintain their geometric shapes and proportions relative to the environment without distortion, successfully simulating a 3D effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the material properties of the blue blanket around the kitten look natural, supporting the 3D illusion without introducing any artificial artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue blanket in Image B exhibits realistic texture and shading that supports the 3D jump effect. The fibers and folds of the material appear consistent with natural fabric behavior, showing no artificial artifacts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the kitten's paws shaped naturally, consistently placed, and free from any distortion or unrealistic deformations after applying the 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible parts of the kitten's paws in Image B show a natural shape and consistent placement. There is no evidence of distortion or unrealistic deformation, reflecting a realistic portrayal after the 3D effect.",
