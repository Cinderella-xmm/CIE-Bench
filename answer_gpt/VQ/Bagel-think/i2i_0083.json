      "question": "Does the digital display screen appear to fit seamlessly within the rectangular frame previously occupied by the painting, maintaining the same proportions and alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital display screen fits within the same space as the painting shown in Image A. The rectangular proportions and alignment with the wall are preserved, indicating that the screen is intended to occupy the same area as the painting without any mismatch in size or orientation. This suggests that the fit is seamless.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the texture and surface finish of the digital display screen consistent with the surrounding wall, ensuring it does not introduce any unnatural artifacts or discrepancies in material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital display screen in Image B has a typical glossy surface with a reflective finish, which commonly contrasts with the matte texture and uniform coloring of painted walls. The transition between the screen and the wall is smooth, but the inherent differences in material textures and finishes are expected. The digital screen naturally has a different visual appearance compared to the wall material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all the details around the digital display screen, such as the wall edges and the flooring, preserved without any visible distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The area surrounding the digital display screen in Image B, including the wall edges and flooring, appear undistorted and maintain their original level of detail as visible in Image A. This continuity indicates that the integration of the screen into the scene did not lead to loss of contextual detail.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the digital display screen preserve the balance and symmetry of the room, with the armchairs still appearing naturally aligned relative to the new display screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armchairs remain symmetrically aligned and well-balanced in relation to the digital display screen, as they were with the painting in Image A. The overall aesthetic and spatial arrangement retains harmony despite the different focal point introduced by the digital screen.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and light reflections cast by the digital display screen match those expected from a wall-mounted object, without creating unrealistic or conflicting lighting patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital display screen in Image B exhibits shadows and light reflections typical of a wall-mounted object, given its flat positioning against the wall. The lighting patterns appear consistent with expectations for such an installation, not suggesting any unrealistic or incongruous lighting effects.",
