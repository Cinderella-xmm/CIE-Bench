      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D cartoon characters retain smooth textures and detailed features without any visible artifacts?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi-style characters are characterized by exaggerated features, often smooth and simplified for a cartoonish aesthetic. In Image B, these chibi characters exhibit a smoothness typical of 3D animation, and there are no visible artifacts disrupting the visual flow. The texture detail, although simpler due to their style, appears intentionally consistent with their design. Therefore, they retain smooth textures and detailed features without artifacts.",
