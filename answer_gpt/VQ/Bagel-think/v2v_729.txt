    "Question": "Q1: Does the circular badge appear seamlessly integrated into the scene without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the circular badge is held by a hand, showcasing a scene including the Statue of Liberty, Eiffel Tower, and London Eye. The integration refers to how naturally these elements fit together without causing any visual distraction. The badge appears artistically drawn and distinct from a photo-realistic style, giving it an illustrative and stylized look. This artistic approach inherently lacks photo-realistic seamless integration but maintains consistency within its visual context.",
