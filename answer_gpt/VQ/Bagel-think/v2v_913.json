      "question": "Are the chocolate glaze and layered design of the cake girl consistent with the original cake's appearance, without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake girl has a chocolate glaze on top and a layered structure that mirrors the original cake shown in Image A. The glaze drips naturally over the sides, mimicking real chocolate icing. The layers of chocolate sponge and frosting between the layers appear smooth and consistent, retaining the realistic texture of a typical chocolate cake. The artist has successfully translated the original cake's visual elements into the character design without any noticeable distortions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the cake girl maintain structural consistency with the original cake, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or unnatural proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake girl maintains a rectangular structure similar to the triangular shape of the original cake as seen in Image A. The edges are clean, and the proportions of the layers and chocolate glaze are visually consistent with what would be expected in a cartoon-style adaptation. There are no evident breaks or deformations that disrupt the structural integrity of the cake character.",

      "question": "Is the cake girl's posture on the plate natural, with no distortion in her hands or the plate, and does it maintain visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cake girl is depicted sitting squarely on a plate, similar to how the original cake rests on its plate in Image A. The spoon in front adds to the scene without any distortion in its appearance. While the cake girlâ€™s design is playful and stylized, she maintains a natural positioning on the plate with no apparent distortion in her form or the dishware, maintaining a credible visual presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the chocolate spirals and the cake girl's grip on the spoon depicted without unnatural textures, and do they maintain visual plausibility and structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake girl doesn't have chocolate spirals, but she interacts with the world using a spoon and hand-like appendages. The chocolate glaze and the layered cake structure maintain their logical coherence, and while the spoon interaction is stylized for the cartoonish effect, it appears plausible within the comic's visual style. There are no textures or grips that seem unnatural given the context of this artistic interpretation.",

      "question": "Is the composition of the manga panels balanced, with appropriate white space for dialogue and no visual clutter affecting the overall readability and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The manga panels in Image B are well-composed, with each panel featuring dialogue and imagery that are clearly separated with white spaces, preventing any visual clutter. Each scene is easy to interpret, and the panels are spaced to allow the artwork and text to be distinct and legible. The design ensures readability and maintains visual credibility, consistent with common manga styles.",
