    "Question": "Q1: Are the spectacles positioned correctly over the bear’s eyes without deforming the surrounding fur or causing unnatural lens reflections?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no spectacles present on the bear. The image instead features a cartoon representation with various layouts, but not spectacles, so the question is not applicable to the depicted content.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the bear’s facial expression show subtle aging features (like wrinkles) without distorting the nose, mouth, or jawline geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bear is shown in a cartoonish and stylized form on the right side, thus eliminating realistic expressions like wrinkles. The illustration style inherently doesn't allow for such detailed aging features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the speech bubble clearly connected to the bear’s mouth and does it not obscure or distort nearby fur or water details?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not include a speech bubble emanating from the bear's mouth. Instead, there is a cartoon character holding a sign with text unrelated to speech, implying that the bear's mouth is unaffected by a speech bubble.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the transformation chart fit naturally within the bear’s mouth without exceeding jaw limits or causing visible deformations in the mouth structure?",
    "explanation": "The transformation chart in Image B is not naturally positioned within the bear's mouth but appears as a separate visual element in the lower part of the compilation. This setup does not involve the bear's jaw or mouth, resulting in no deformation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the labeled stages in the transformation chart aligned with the river surface and do they cast appropriate shadows or depth cues consistent with the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation chart, which illustrates fish stages, is not aligned or integrated with any river surface from either image frame. The chart is depicted independently without any shadows or depth cues synchronous with a scene.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the fact box positioned in an open area of the image (e.g., near the riverbank) without covering important details like tree trunks or water flow?",
    "explanation": "The fact box, in the form of a sign held by the cartoon character, does not interrupt any realistic elements in either image panel. It exists as a separate illustration, not overlaid on a specific scene like a riverbank.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the text in the speech bubble and fact box rendered with clean edges and no pixelation or aliasing artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The text in Image B shows distorted and scrambled letters without clean readability, indicative of potential pixelation or deliberate alteration. This points towards text not being rendered with perfectly clean edges.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Do the blue hues in the transformation chart and the brown-green tones in the forest background match the original image’s color grading without noticeable shifts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hues in the transformation chart (blue) and forest area (stylized into a cartoon setting) do not accurately correspond with the original color tones from Image A, indicating color grading shifts.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q9: Are the bear’s fur strands and water splashes still visible and detailed around the added speech bubble and transformation chart?",
    "explanation": "The cartoonish representation in Image B does not maintain the detailed texture of fur strands or water splashes, which are features prominent in Image A. Therefore, none of these natural details are preserved.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q10: Do both panels occupy their intended regions within the 16:9 frame without cutting off the bear’s legs or the tree line at the edges?",
    "explanation": "The layout of Image B splits two distinct regions without affecting core subjects such as the tree line or the bear's legs, which remain visible without truncation in the panel presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
