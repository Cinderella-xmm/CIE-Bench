      "question": "Do the stained glass wings feature consistent, smooth patterns without jagged edges or pixelated textures, and do they appear to transmit light naturally as if made of glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B are depicted with clean and intricate stained glass designs, exhibiting smooth transitions between colors and sections without any visible jagged edges or distortion.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dress composed of leaf-like and vine-like elements that maintain natural curvature, shading, and thickness, with no visible seams or synthetic textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress is designed with leaf and vine motifs that display organic curves and a realistic appearance. The shading enhances depth and gives the impression of natural thickness, which contributes to the overall coherence of the costume without any noticeable seams or synthetic-like textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glowing mushrooms and twinkling fireflies integrated into the background with consistent lighting and depth, avoiding floating or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows mushrooms and fireflies that are seamlessly integrated into the background. The lighting used is consistent across these elements, which are positioned in a manner that both respects visual depth and maintains a sense of cohesion and natural placement without any disruptive composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do both hands show five fingers each with natural joint alignment, smooth skin texture, and no distortion or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands of the figure have five fingers each. The fingers appear naturally aligned with realistic joint posture and smooth skin texture, without any distortion, extra digits, or irregularities, maintaining anatomical plausibility.",

      "question": "Are the legs positioned in a physically plausible seated posture with natural knee and ankle angles, and no elongation or compression of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The legs in Image B are depicted in a seated posture that reflects natural knee and ankle angles, consistent with how a person would sit. There are no signs of elongation or compression of the limbs, ensuring that the posture is physically plausible and anatomically correct.",
