      "question": "Are the swirling ocean wave patterns inside the crystal bottle smooth, continuous, and free of jagged edges or unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swirling ocean wave patterns inside the bottle are depicted with fluid lines and gradients that simulate natural water motion. The waves have smooth curves that transition seamlessly, appearing free of any jagged edges or distortions. This can be reasoned from the artistic design aimed at representing the fluidity and dynamic nature of ocean waves, thus confirming the presence of continuity and smoothness.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the golden maritime symbols on the bottle label occupy the correct area, maintain sharp edges, and show no signs of pixelation or smudging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden maritime symbols on the label in Image B appear sharp and distinct, with their edges well-defined and free from any pixelation or smudging. The choice of metallic color and detailed design illustrates attention to detail in creating refined elements that stand out clearly against the backdrop of wave patterns, indicating high-resolution imagery.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the compass rose at the top of the packaging have evenly spaced metallic points with realistic reflections and no misalignment or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The compass rose on the packaging in Image B is depicted with evenly spaced points that display metallic shading and reflections, contributing to a realistic appearance. The design is well-structured, with consistent intervals between each point, and lacks any visible misalignment or clipping artifacts, which ensures aesthetic accuracy and design coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition from the bottle neck to the wave-patterned body seamless, with no abrupt breaks or geometric deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition from the bottle neck to its body is designed to be smooth, incorporating artistic continuity in the overall aesthetic theme. There are fluid lines connecting the top and body, without any visible breaks or irregularities that would imply geometric deformations. Such design choices signify expertise in glass artistry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the parchment surface of the packaging display consistent aging texture without artificial streaks or uneven shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parchment surface in Image B displays texture that simulates aging by using evenly distributed, soft shading and a warm color palette. The impression of aged parchment derives from a consistent pattern that lacks artificial streaks, contributing to a credible portrayal of an antiqued surface in line with common designs for decorative packaging.",
