    "Question": "Q1: Is the watch communicator on the plaid tie positioned naturally within the fabric, with consistent color, texture, and lighting that match the surrounding material?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the watch communicator is clearly marked with a distinct design separate from the plaid pattern of the tie. The color and texture of the watch communicator do not match the surrounding tie material, creating a contrast that suggests it is not naturally embedded in fabric. Comparing this to Image A, there is no actual watch communicator visible on the tie, indicating it was digitally added to Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the camera lens embedded in the emblem on the right suit’s lapel aligned with the pattern and fabric, showing no gaps, misaligned edges, or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the camera lens appears as an overlay on the suit lapel, noticeably distinct from the emblem design and fabric. There seems to be a mismatch in alignment and inconsistent lighting compared to the surrounding texture, indicating it is not seamlessly integrated. Image A shows a pin on the lapel with no camera lens feature, reinforcing the edit in Image B.",

    "Question": "Q4: Do the characters’ necks and shoulders retain natural proportions and smooth contours, without stretched, compressed, or fragmented shapes after anthropomorphization?",
    "explanation": "The characters in Image B show intentionally altered proportions typical of cartoonish or anthropomorphic styles. The necks appear elongated and the shoulders widened, exhibiting a stylized deviation from natural human anatomy. This suggests a deliberate modification rather than an issue of distortion.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the grassy field and sky background free from distortion, noise, or color inconsistencies that suggest digital manipulation or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B of the grassy field and sky is illustrated and not based on a real photograph, contrasting the natural background in Image A. It exhibits consistent color and texture typical of illustrations and does not show signs suggesting digital manipulation or loss of detail typical of photo editing artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
