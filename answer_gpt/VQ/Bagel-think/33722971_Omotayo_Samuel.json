      "question": "Do the facial features on each suitcase align naturally with the object’s shape without distorting its geometry or creating unnatural protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no facial features present on any of the suitcases. Each suitcase has a smooth surface, and there are no modifications or additions of face-like elements. Given this information, there are no distortions or unnatural protrusions because the suitcases maintain their original form. Additionally, no visible facial features are integrated into the suitcase designs, which would typically require careful alignment to avoid distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure have five fingers per hand, with natural hand shape and joint alignment, and no anatomical deformities or missing limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is holding a briefcase with one hand visible. The exposed hand appears to be naturally shaped, with each finger positioned correctly and aligned in anatomical order. There are no visible deformities or apparent missing limbs, suggesting a typical human hand configuration has been maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the velvet texture applied smoothly across all surfaces without visible seams, repetition, or unnatural lighting reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a smooth velvet texture on the background wall and the suitcase surface around the chibi character. This texture appears to be consistent without abrupt seams and there are realistic lighting reflections that align with the object's position and the scene's lighting conditions, creating a harmonious appearance in the materials displayed.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the world map backdrop properly aligned with the scene’s perspective and does it integrate seamlessly without warping or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backdrop depicted is a flat world map integrated into the scene beside the figures and objects. Its alignment follows the perspective, fitting comfortably without warping or clipping. The integration seems seamless and the map’s flat surface supports its proper alignment with the scene orientation. Perspective considerations reflect a balanced and appropriately scaled setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the display case fully enclosing the scene with correct proportions, no clipping of elements, and realistic glass transparency or reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible display case enclosing the scene in the edited image (Image B). The objects and figures are situated in an open space without any sign of enclosure. Without the presence of a case, there aren't concerns regarding clipping, proportions, or the transparency and reflection of glass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all fine details (e.g., stitching, hair, texture edges) preserved and free from blurring, ghosting, or pixelation after editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, fine details like stitching on suitcases, the texture edges, and possibly textile features on clothing are visible and appear detailed without blurring or pixelation. The texture of the fabric and hair edges on the characters seem sharp, portraying clarity without ghosting effects.",
