    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features and tiny hands added to each cereal bar proportionally sized and positioned in a way that maintains the original rectangular shape of the bars without distorting their geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features and tiny hands are added to each cereal bar character. Evaluating the proportion and positioning, these additions do not distort the original rectangular geometry of the cereal bars. The features are center-aligned, maintaining the overall shape and dimensions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cereal bar characters appear to interact with the pink flamingo mug in a physically plausible manner, such as touching or leaning toward it, without violating spatial logic or causing visual inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, some cereal bar characters are positioned near the pink flamingo mug, but there is no indication of physical interaction such as touching or leaning. The mug and bars are placed separately without any direct interaction, maintaining spatial logic and consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the whimsical font placed above the cereal bar characters clearly legible, properly aligned, and free from artifacts such as jagged edges or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The whimsical font in Image B, while stylistically fun, is not clearly legible, as some letters appear intentionally distorted, compromising readability. The alignment appears playful yet inconsistent in clarity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the added facial features and hands on the cereal bars preserve the original texture of the chocolate and cereal layers, without introducing unnatural smoothness, sharp edges, or missing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features and hands added in Image B do not interfere with the texture of the chocolate and cereal layers, maintaining the original detail. The chocolate appears textured and the cereal layer retains its granulated look, alongside the playful additions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tiny hands added to the cereal bars have a natural number of fingers (no more than five), proper curvature, and appropriate shadowing to match the lighting in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tiny hands added to each cereal bar in Image B consistently show a natural number of fingers, generally no more than four, appropriate for a cartoon style. The hands have proper curvature and match the overall lighting, lending them a coherent appearance.",
