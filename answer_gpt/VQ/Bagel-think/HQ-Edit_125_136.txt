    "Question": "Q1: Are the shapes of the astronaut's helmet, suit segments, and life support pack simplified but still geometrically consistent with their original forms without jagged or broken edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut's helmet, suit segments, and life support pack are depicted with clear lines and smooth curves, suggesting a simplified but coherent representation of the original forms. The artistic style suggests an intentional abstraction, but the overall geometry remains consistent, free from jagged or broken edges that would indicate a lack of coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the texture applied to the spacesuit appear uniformly distributed and physically plausible, without unnatural repetition or artificial pattern artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the spacesuit is depicted with smooth surfaces and uniform shadows, the texture lacks realistic detail typically found in physical fabrics or materials used in actual spacesuits. However, considering the artistic style employed, the visual choice supports uniformity without appearing repetitively unnatural, aligning with a stylized depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the accent gold colors confined to specific design elements (such as patch borders or connectors) and do they blend naturally without color bleed into adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "The gold accents in Image B are placed on specific areas of the spacesuit, such as patch borders and connectors. These colors are confined to their intended locations and do not bleed into the adjacent white areas, indicating a clean and precise application of color within the context of stylized design elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the directional arrows show clear movement from the astronaut toward the ISS without overlapping or distorting the astronautâ€™s limbs or the station structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the directional arrows are designed as part of a diagrammatic representation. They point outwards from the astronaut toward different labels and design elements. They do not overlap with the astronaut's limbs or the space station structures, thereby keeping the paths clear and unobstructed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the text positioned at the bottom edge of the image without covering critical parts of the Moon or ISS, and is it clearly readable without distortion or shadow effects?",
    "explanation": "There is no text positioned at the bottom edge of Image B. The existing text is placed towards the top and aligns within the design's context, while no other part, including the bottom, features text in this image description. In the context of where text appears, it's rendered clearly without distortion or shadow effects, occupying a space that complements the visual without overlaying critical elements.",
    "answer": "No"
