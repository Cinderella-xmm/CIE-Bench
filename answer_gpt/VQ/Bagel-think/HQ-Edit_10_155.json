      "question": "Is the glass dome enclosing the lantern transparent and smooth, with no visible distortions, cracks, or unnatural refraction patterns that disrupt the perception of depth or clarity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome enclosing the lantern is colored and features a mosaic-like design typical of lamps, with various colored glass pieces joined together. Unlike a perfectly smooth and transparent glass, this type of glass naturally introduces distortions because of its design. The mosaic pattern inherently disrupts a clear view, with visible texture and refraction caused by the joinery and the individual glass piece curves.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scaled-down ceramic street pavements composed of clearly defined, uniformly sized tiles with accurate color transitions and no blurred or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to introduce a miniature market scene around the lantern with scaled-down ceramic street pavements. The pavements have clearly defined tiles in uniform sizes. The color transitions are distinct, with minimal blurring at the edges, which ensures the scene looks realistic at this scale.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the textile merchants and their fabric canopies proportionally small compared to the lantern, with realistic shapes and textures that do not appear stretched, duplicated, or unnaturally fused with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, miniature textile merchants and canopies are placed around the base of the lantern. These elements are clearly delineated, with realistic shapes that maintain proportionality with the oversized lantern. Textures of the fabric canopies seem detailed and distinct, with no visible artifacts suggesting they are stretched or duplicated. They are not unnaturally fused with the lantern or each other.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the palm trees have properly shaped fronds, rooted bases, and consistent shadows that align with the light source from the lantern, without appearing flat or detached from the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees situated around the lantern appear proportionally small to fit the miniature scene. Their fronds have detailed, well-defined shapes. The bases of the trees appear rooted firmly to the ground. Additionally, the shadows cast by the trees are consistent with the warm light source from the lantern, aligning well with the direction and intensity of the light, and they donâ€™t seem flat or detached.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base of the dome feature a textured, weathered surface with subtle variations in tone and depth, free from uniform patterns or digital artifacts that suggest over-processing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the dome supporting the lantern contains a textured surface that is indicative of metal or ceramic with an ornate pattern. There are observable variations in tone and depth which contribute to the realistic portrayal of a handcrafted object. No uniform patterns or digital artifacts are visible that would suggest over-processing.",
