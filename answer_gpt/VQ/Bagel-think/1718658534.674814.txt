    "Question": "Q1: Does the surface of the figurine exhibit a uniform glossy finish consistent with ceramic material, without patches of retained knit texture or uneven sheen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the material of the figurine is immediately distinguishable by its glossy, smooth finish that is characteristic of ceramic. The sheen is consistent across the surface, showing no signs of texture similar to knitting which would appear rough and fibrous. The uniform shine confirms the ceramic-like material, distinct from the knit texture seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the terracotta color applied uniformly across the entire body of the figurine, without streaks, discoloration, or mismatched tones in different areas?",
    "explanation": "The terracotta color in Image B is uniformly applied, with a consistent and even tone across the figurine's body. There are no noticeable streaks, discolorations, or variations in color that would suggest uneven application. This uniform coloration is indicative of a polished ceramic finish, differing from the single-color yarn of Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the floral engravings clearly defined, proportionally scaled, and seamlessly embedded into the surface of the figurine without causing geometric distortions or overlapping inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "From the visual cues in Image B, the floral engravings are distinct, intricate, and proportionally scaled to the size of the figurine. They are smoothly embedded into the ceramic surface, enhancing the aesthetic without causing any geometric distortions or uneven overlaps. These engravings are absent in Image A, where the texture comes solely from knitting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the amber-colored eyes have a smooth, polished appearance with appropriate reflection and depth, and are they correctly positioned within the facial structure without appearing displaced or oversized?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the figurine are amber-colored with a smooth, polished finish. They have a reflective quality that suggests depth typical of glass or polished stone. Their positioning is symmetrical within the facial area, correctly sized and not disproportionately large or displaced. Compared to the simple black eyes of the knitted object in Image A, these eyes reflect a higher level of detail and refinement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the figurine resting flat on a wooden surface with visible wood grain and natural shadowing beneath it, indicating proper physical support and spatial coherence?",
    "explanation": "The figurine in Image B appears to be resting properly on a flat wooden surface. The wood grain is visible, and the natural shadow beneath the figurine suggests stable physical support and coherence in space. This shadowing and grain detail is absent in Image A, where the knitted object is held and has a flat background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
