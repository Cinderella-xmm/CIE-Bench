      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine retain proportionally consistent limbs and head size relative to the body, avoiding unnatural elongation or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi figurines typically have exaggerated head sizes relative to their bodies, but the limbs should remain proportionally consistent. In image B, the figurine's head is larger compared to its body, which is common in chibi designs. The arms and body appear proportionate without noticeable elongation or compression, which adheres to the typical chibi style.",
