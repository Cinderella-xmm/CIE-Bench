      "question": "Do the curled horn-like structures on both armrests have smooth, continuous curves without jagged edges or inconsistent thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the curled horn-like structures on the armrests exhibit grooves and pointy elements, suggesting a texture resembling horns. Such characteristics may include jagged edges or variation in thickness, distinguishing them from perfectly smooth curves. Therefore, analyzing the details, which incorporate world knowledge of horn textures being typically uneven, leads to the conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bark-textured scales on the backrest evenly distributed, with natural variations in shape and depth, and do they follow the original contour of the sofa without tearing or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bark-textured scales on Image B's backrest indeed showcase a natural design with variations typical of tree bark. The structure appears to integrate with the sofa's original contour, promoting a naturalistic appearance in shape and alignment, adhering to the perceived continuity without noticeable misalignments.",

      "question": "Does the mossy, leafy mane extend continuously from the top of the cushions, showing layered depth and natural variation in green tones, without sharp seams or floating leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mossy, leafy mane appears to emanate organically from above the cushions, maintaining a layered and varied green tone typical of natural foliage. The texture and color gradation are consistent, with no apparent seams or disconnected elements, promoting a seamless integration into the sofa structure.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the emerald eyes positioned centrally above the middle cushion, emitting a soft, diffused glow that casts subtle shadows on the surrounding leather without harsh outlines or overexposure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the emerald eyes centrally located above the middle cushion. They emanate a diffused glow that interacts with surrounding surfaces subtly, casting gentle shadows and avoiding harshness or overexposure. This indicates a thoughtful rendering approach, suitable for the integration within the setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wooden limbs extend from under the front edge of the sofa, resting firmly on the carpet, with vines wrapped around clawed ends that appear structurally sound and proportionate to the sofa's size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs are designed to resemble wood, extending from the sofa's front, meeting the carpet below. While they appear proportionate, their position signifies they should appear firmly placed, but additional analysis needed might question their complete structural integrity due to being more decorative than functional.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there faint, localized glows or energy effects near the limbs or eyes that blend into the environment without creating visible artifacts like pixelation or unnatural color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image showcases localized glows primarily around the eyes and certain areas near the limbs. These effects blend seamlessly into the sofa's background without creating noticeable artifacts such as pixelation or color bleeding, maintaining the image's overall quality and visual coherence.",
