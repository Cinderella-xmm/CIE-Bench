      "question": "Are the person's arms and hands in a raised position that looks natural and consistent with their chibi-style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed figure has both arms raised with clenched fists, which is a common pose for chibi-style figures, emphasizing an energetic or triumphant demeanor. The chibi-style character has exaggerated proportions, making the pose suitable and natural for this form, even though it may appear less natural in a realistic context.",

      "question": "Does the added text \"Level 6 · Mega Meal\" blend well with the background and does not introduce distracting artifacts or look unnaturally placed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no text 'Level 6 · Mega Meal' observed in Image B. Instead, 'TLE_ 2.SHORE' and 'LOEEM 1 FIOP MU01' appear in the image. These elements are typical in toy or collectible figurine packaging, giving it a playful or branding look. However, they do look unnatural due to unusual wording and placement.",

      "question": "Do the burgers and fries on the table retain their realistic texture, detail, and shape, appearing as if they were untouched by the transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the food items appear simplified and stylized, fitting the chibi-style transformation. They have lost the realistic texture and detail that are present in Image A, which is expected as part of the artistic style change.",

      "question": "Has the person been transformed into a chibi-style figure that maintains recognizable facial and body features without unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person has been transformed into a chibi-style figure, characterized by exaggerated and simplified body proportions, which is typical in this design. The textures and details are appropriate for a chibi-style, and although simplified, they appear intentional rather than unnatural.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the scene as a chibi-style figure on a base, common in collectible figurines. Although the proportions are exaggerated and details simplified, they align with the chibi art style aesthetics, contributing to a trendy collectible figurine appearance. There are no obvious distortions beyond intentional stylistic choices.",
