      "question": "Does the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo appear smooth and well-integrated without any unnatural edges or blurring around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo is placed on the top portion of the refrigerator door. By observing the visual cues, it seems that the logo does not display any overt signs of unnatural edges or blurring. Commonly, logos that are well-integrated into an image appear consistent and coherent with the existing surfaces without showing pixelation or poor blending. Based on this analysis, the logo seems smooth and properly integrated.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the custom label on the top shelf placed appropriately, without distorting the surrounding items or creating visual inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the custom label is visible on the top shelf. It appears to be a different object placed among groceries. The placement seems to not affect the natural position and orientation of the surrounding items (like jars and bottles), and there are no visible visual inconsistencies, such as unexpected distortions or overlaps. This suggests the label is placed appropriately without causing any distortion in appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the texture and details around the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label consistent with the rest of the refrigerator's surface, avoiding any noticeable loss or alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label on Image B should maintain the same textural and surface quality as the surrounding areas for a seamless appearance. The observed texture and details of these elements seem consistent with the smooth and clean surface of the refrigerator and shelves, avoiding any noticeable loss or alterations that might suggest digital manipulation inconsistency. Thus, they appear consistent with the rest of the image surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label maintain appropriate scaling relative to their surrounding elements, appearing neither too large nor too small?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions of the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and custom label in Image B are crucial for visual harmony within the image. Proper scaling involves ensuring that these elements are appropriately sized relative to the refrigerator and other items like bottles and jars. The logo and label appear to be proportionalâ€”they are neither disproportionately large nor diminutively small compared to nearby objects. Therefore, they maintain appropriate scaling relative to the surrounding elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting and shadowing on the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label correspond logically to the light source, contributing to a natural and authentic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the lighting and shadow effects on the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and custom label in Image B requires assessing their interaction with the apparent light sources, such as the daylight coming through the window and the interior lighting of the refrigerator. The logo and label's shadows and lighting seem to align logically with these light sources, suggesting they contribute to a natural and authentic appearance without disrupting the overall lighting consistency in the image.",
