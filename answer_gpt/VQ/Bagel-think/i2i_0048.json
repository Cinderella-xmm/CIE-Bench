      "question": "Are the stripes on the zebra sharp and distinct without any unnatural pixelation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes on the zebra appear to have lost some of their clarity and sharpness due to the editing, possessing some noticeable pixelation and blurring which is indicative of strong contrast adjustments or possibly noise addition. These effects contribute to a less natural appearance of the stripes compared to what one would expect in a high-quality, unedited image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the zebra's fur textures appear natural without any visible artificial streaks or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fur texture on the zebra in Image B shows some visible artificial streaks or patterns, likely due to excessive enhancement or sharpening. This can result from over-processing, where the natural texture is exaggerated or altered unnaturally, leading to patterns that don't align with naturally occurring zebra fur.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the zebra's body consistent and free from any geometric distortions like warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions of the zebra's body in Image B remain consistent with what would be expected, as there are no apparent signs of warping or stretching. The zebra's body retains its natural geometry with no noticeable distortion caused by the editing process.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the relative position between the zebra and the background grassland remain unchanged and natural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The editing process in Image B does not seem to alter the positional relationship between the zebra and the grassland. The zebra stands naturally on the grassland, and its position relative to the background remains unchanged, maintaining a natural appearance in terms of positioning.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the grass blades and the zebra's hooves detailed and free from any loss of sharpness or introduction of noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable loss of detail and an introduction of noise affecting the grass and possibly the zebra's hooves. The strong editing adjustments affect the clarity and detail in these areas, making them less sharp and more textured with noise than they likely appeared originally.",
