    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the tutu maintain a balanced, layered structure with no visible warping or collapsed sections that suggest digital distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tutu appears to have a symmetrical, balanced structure with no noticeable distortions. The layers are consistently even, maintaining a natural form that is typical of a ballerina's tutu. This indicates that there are no digital distortions affecting its appearance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glitter elements seamlessly blended into the tutu and bodice, showing natural variation in size and brightness without pixelation or unnatural clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glitter elements on the tutu and bodice are illustrated with a consistent texture, suggesting an artistic style rather than photo-realistic representation. There is no obvious pixelation or clumping, given the nature of the illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background gradient smooth and continuous, with no visible banding or abrupt color shifts that separate it from the subjectâ€™s silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background gradient in Image B transitions smoothly from one color to another. There are no signs of banding or abrupt color shifts, and the subject's silhouette is clearly defined against the background, maintaining continuity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the blank message areas fully opaque and aligned with the image plane, with no visible edge artifacts or texture disruption beneath them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible blank message areas or artifacts impacting the alignment or texture of the image. The image plane and elements are cohesive, with no disruptions.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the floral motifs along the borders stay within the frame boundaries and maintain consistent scale and orientation without intersecting the ballerina or floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral motifs are positioned along the borders and do not interfere with the main subject or floor. They maintain a consistent scale and orientation and are well-contained within the frame.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both hands show exactly five fingers each, with natural curvature and spacing, and no extra or fused digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of the hands in the illustration style does not distinctly show five fingers with clear curvature and spacing. The simplified artistic style suggests a more abstract representation, which does not allow a precise count of fingers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are both feet positioned correctly on pointe with natural arches and toes, and is the supporting leg aligned to sustain the posture without unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet of the ballerina are depicted in an illustration style where detailed anatomical alignment such as natural arches and toes on pointe is abstracted. The supporting leg appears aligned with the posture but lacks the detailed realism to comprehensively confirm natural positioning.",
