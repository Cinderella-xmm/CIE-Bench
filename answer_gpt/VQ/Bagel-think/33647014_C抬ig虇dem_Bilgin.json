    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed king have smooth, flowing contours resembling water without jagged edges or disconnected fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed king is rendered with a design that suggests fluidity, as seen in the flowing contours that resemble water. The edges appear smooth, and there are no visible jagged lines or disconnected fragments, which indicates a coherent and thoughtful design. This interpretation utilizes both visual cues and a comparison to known fluid and water-like textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the flame elements on the transformed queen composed of layered, tapering shapes that follow natural fire motion without abrupt transitions or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed queen in Image B is designed with flame elements that are layered and taper gracefully, mimicking the motion of fire. These shapes transition smoothly and lack any abrupt or sharp breaks, consistent with natural fire patterns. The edges are clean, without any pixelation, painting a complete and smooth visual.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the transformed knights display consistent stone texture with clear carving lines and no distorted proportions or floating fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knights in Image B appear to have been replaced by figures which are not clearly identifiable as stone textured. They are rendered with soft, fantasy-like features rather than a stone texture with carving lines. The absence of distorted proportions and floating fragments doesn't confirm a stone texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the transformed bishops rendered with soft, gradient edges and flowing lines that suggest motion without visible pixelation or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed bishops have smooth, flowing lines indicative of motion. The rendering includes gradient edges without any noticeable pixelation or ghosting. This suggests a well-executed design that maintains the integrity of the visual form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the transformed pawns show uniform glow without haloing or blurred outlines that separate them from the board?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pawns in Image B exhibit a uniform glow, serving to highlight their ethereal design. There is no evidence of haloing effect or blurred outlines; instead, the glow is consistently applied, keeping the pawns distinct from the board, indicative of well-controlled digital effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the transformed rook feature a tree trunk with visible bark texture and legible runes without stretching or warping of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed rook is represented as a tree trunk that visibly displays bark texture, and the runes on its surface appear legible. The structure does not show signs of stretching or warping, demonstrating that the design is consistent and deliberate.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the shadows beneath all transformed pieces align with the light direction and object height, without appearing detached or incorrectly sized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows in Image B align well with the light direction, originating from the light source, and correlate with the height and positioning of each chess piece. This ensures visual coherence across the image, with shadows appropriately sized and attached to their respective pieces.",
