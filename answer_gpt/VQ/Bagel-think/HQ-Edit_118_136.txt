    "Question": "Q1: Does the metallic armor on the skater's torso and limbs maintain anatomical proportions and avoid unnatural bends or stretched shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic armor is designed to fit the skater's body. The proportions of the torso and limbs appear to follow human anatomy closely, avoiding unnatural bends or stretched shapes. This conclusion is drawn from the aligned curves and segments that show awareness of body contours.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the hoverboardâ€™s transparent deck visually consistent in shape and structure, with no broken edges or misplaced glow effects that suggest digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hoverboard has a smooth, transparent design with consistent edges and glow effects, which are well-integrated into the design without suggesting the presence of digital artifacts. The hoverboard displays symmetry and uniformity consistent with its design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the graffiti elements on the ramps and walls rendered as animated digital displays rather than static paint, with smooth transitions and no pixelation or jagged outlines?",
    "explanation": "The graffiti elements in Image B are vibrant and dynamic, resembling animated digital displays. They show smooth transitions in color without pixelation or jagged outlines, making them appear as digitally enhanced graphics but not strictly animation.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the neon highlights on the armor and hoverboard cast soft, consistent glows on nearby surfaces without creating harsh, unrealistic reflections or color bleed?",
    "explanation": "The neon highlights in Image B provide a soft, consistent glow on the armor and hoverboard. While the surrounding areas are illuminated, there is no evidence of harsh reflections or unrealistic color bleed that detracts from the overall visual quality. The glow effects are carefully controlled to complement the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the motion lines positioned along the trajectory of the skater and hoverboard, following natural flow without intersecting or overlapping key features like limbs or the board in an implausible manner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, motion lines follow the trajectory of the skater and hoverboard accurately, enhancing the perception of movement. They are positioned correctly without intersecting or overlapping key features like limbs or the board, which maintains a plausible depiction of speed and agility.",
    "answer": "Yes"
