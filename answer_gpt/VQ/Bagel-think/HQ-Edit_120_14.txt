    "Question": "Q1: Are the cogwheel joints clearly defined, aligned with the frame's geometry, and rendered with consistent metallic texture and shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cogwheel joints are part of the steampunk aesthetic alterations. Within the steampunk visual style, cogwheels are usually given a metallic sheen with visible details and shading that connotes depth and complexity. In Image B, the cogwheels seem well-defined, aligning with the frame’s geometry, and possess a consistent texture and shading reminiscent of metal. This suggests that the artist put effort into rendering them with care.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the carapace-shaped seat have detailed surface textures, proper curvature, and seamless attachment to the seat post without visible seams or warping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there isn't a carapace-shaped seat present. The seat area in the steampunk design retains the original shape from Image A, without the addition of a carapace design or distinct textures beyond the original leather seat. The focus of Image B's transformations is on clock faces and wing-like structures rather than modifying the seat. Hence, it lacks the described features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the mechanical legs have realistic hinge mechanisms, correct proportions, and no overlapping or misplaced segments that break spatial logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, mechanical legs as described do not seem to be added. The alterations focus on steampunk elements such as clock faces and gears, but not mechanical limbs. Since Image B lacks the inclusion of mechanical legs based on the available transformation, the criteria of realistic hinge mechanisms and spatial logic do not apply here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the wingtips smoothly attached to the top tube, showing consistent copper coloring, reflective properties, and no jagged edges or texture repetition?",
    "explanation": "Image B features wing-like structures extending from the frame, which are indicative of a steampunk style. These wings appear smooth and well-integrated with the bicycle's top tube. The coloring is consistent with copper, a significant element in steampunk designs. The textures seem deliberate without evident repetition or jaggedness, indicating careful attention to attachment and rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the clock faces clearly visible, properly embedded in the handlebars, and free from texture artifacts, incorrect lighting, or distorted numerals/runes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clock faces embedded within the bicycle’s design are a highlight of the steampunk transformation. These clocks are clearly visible, with well-maintained clarity and detail. There don't appear to be issues with texture artifacts or lighting, indicating that the numerals or any runes are not distorted. The artistic quality ensures they are correctly rendered and integrated.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do all newly added mechanical elements (legs, joints, wings, clocks) share consistent material properties, such as metallic sheen, color tone, and surface imperfections, without abrupt visual breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the additional steampunk elements such as cogwheels, wings, and clocks exhibit consistent metallic properties in line with a coherent theme. There is a similar color tone, texture, and surface imperfections across various added components, like a polished sheen, ensuring a seamless visual integration. This suggests a deliberate and mindful design without abrupt breaks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
