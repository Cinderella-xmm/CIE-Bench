    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the sleeves and collar clearly defined with clean, sharp edges consistent with a paper-cut style, and do they feature uniform metallic foil highlights without smudging or color bleed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the floral patterns as raised, metallic elements, resembling intricate paper-cuts. These elements are characterized by sharply defined edges and highlight details that resemble consistent metallic foil, ensuring no smudging or color bleed. This depiction shows a high level of precision typical in paper-cut designs.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the enlarged bow positioned centrally and symmetrically on the jeogori, maintaining smooth fabric folds around it without unnatural creasing or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the bow as a metallic, embossed detail, deviating from the fabric appearance. This embellishment is centered and symmetrically positioned on the panel. The depiction uses smooth curves and consistent symmetry without fabric-like creasing, which aligns with embossed design norms for achieving a seamless, geometric look devoid of distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the roof lines and structural components of the background architecture maintain proper alignment and perspective, avoiding skewed angles or floating elements that suggest structural inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of the architectural elements in Image B features a crafted presentation, maintaining an alignment that flows into the embossed design without skewed angles or detached elements. This representation ensures cohesion and perspective integrity, suitable for an artistic embossed style representative of structural design principles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the embossed leather-bound panel uniformly textured across its surface, with no visible seams or irregularities where the stamped elements meet the background, and does it provide a consistent depth impression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases an embossed design on a leather background that presents a uniform texture throughout its surface. The integration of stamped elements is seamless, showing no irregularities at their junction with the leather panel. The depth impression remains consistent, serving the purpose of an aesthetic embossed style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the chain have exactly five fingers with natural joint curvature and skin texture, and does the chain follow a continuous, non-intersecting path without breaking or appearing detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the hand shows four fingers with stylized shapes consistent with embossed designs rather than natural representations. The chain is abstractly represented in the panel without continuous form, aligning with artistic embossing methods that prioritize design over realistic portrayal.",
