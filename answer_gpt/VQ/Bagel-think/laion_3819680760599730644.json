      "question": "Is the lens area transformed into eyes with smooth, symmetrical shapes and natural-looking reflections, without jagged edges or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lens area has been transformed to resemble a stylized eye. The reflection in the lens is depicted with a glossy, cartoon-like shine which is smooth and rounded, typical of cartoon eyes. The shapes are symmetrical, and there are no visible jagged edges or inconsistent lighting, matching the expectation of a well-executed cartoon transformation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buttons on top of the camera in Image B have been creatively reshaped to resemble eyebrows.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an explorer's hat is placed on the camera, fitting well with the camera's top contours. The lighting on the hat matches the overall lighting scheme of the cartoon setting, and there are no visible gaps or overlaps where the hat is attached to the camera body, indicating a careful integration into the scene.",

      "question": "If any part of the backpack is visible, does it show realistic shadows and attachment to the camera body without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A small part of a backpack is visible on the side of the camera in Image B. It appears to be firmly attached without any indication of floating or misalignment. The cartoon-style shading and color scheme enhance the overall consistency, making the backpack look like a natural extension of the camera.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera is situated within a jungle-themed background. The transition between the camera's edges and the background is smooth, with no visible outlines or pixelation. The colors in the jungle background blend well, with no evidence of color bleeding or mismatched edges.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tagline below the camera in Image B reads 'GANG TALINER!' instead of 'Capture every quest!' It is styled in a vibrant, cartoon-like font that complements the playful theme but does not match the wording asked in the question. Therefore, it is not fulfilling the requirement as indicated.",
