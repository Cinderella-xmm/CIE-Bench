    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transition between the train and the cyberpunk background appear seamless without obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is a cyberpunk setting with neon lights and futuristic elements. However, the primary subject in Image B is the individual on a skateboard, not a train, indicating a change in focus and style. Therefore, there isn't a transition involving a train in Image B, making the answer more related to the overall integrity of the scene rather than any such transition. The scene appears internally consistent, with neon glow and city lights more closely relevant to a cyberpunk aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the reflections of neon lights on the train surface realistic and consistent with the expected behavior of light in a cyberpunk setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train is not present in Image B; instead, we have an individual on a neon skateboard in a cyberpunk cityscape, where reflections and light effects primarily relate to the individual and skateboard. The lighting appears well-integrated into the scene, supporting a cyberpunk mood through vibrant colors and holographic effects, though no artifacts or direct reflections on a 'train' surface to assess exist.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the added headphones on the driver look natural and do they preserve the driver's visibility without obscuring important features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The individual in Image B wears headphones, and these fit naturally within a cyberpunk aesthetic, easily harmonizing with neon colors and thematic elements. While assessing obscuring features, the added headphones do not create visual dissonance or obstruction and integrate well into the cyberpunk theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the motion blur effect applied in a way that suggests movement without causing the train to appear distorted or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motion blur effect in Image B is focused on the individual skateboarding rather than a train. It successfully suggests speed and dynamic movement while keeping key details intact. The neon streets and lighting also complement the motion blur, adding to the sense of movement without loss of clarity or creating distortion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall transformed image maintain a consistent edgy and cool style without introducing conflicting or out-of-place elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B captures a cyberpunk theme effectively, with neon lights and urban structures contributing to an edgy and cool visual style. The character's attire, skateboard, and cityscape are cohesive with this theme, indicating the environment is constructed to reflect commonly associated elements of cyberpunk design without introducing any jarring anomalies.",
