      "question": "Are the edges of the jigsaw pieces smooth and interlocking without gaps or overlapping deformities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a framed layout with four sections holding the dragon patterns and central compass. These appear as part of a single piece enclosed within the frame, lacking visible interlocking edges typical of jigsaw puzzles. Therefore, upon analyzing its visual structure and world knowledge concerning jigsaw characteristics, the edges do not exhibit interlocking features with gaps or overlaps.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the dragon patterns appear in darker wood stain and the compass area in lighter wood stain, with no abrupt or unnatural color transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual observation of Image B reveals that the dragon patterns and the compass area are not distinctively differentiated by varying wood stains. Instead, both regions appear uniformly in color and texture, primarily dominated by warm tones without noticeable color transitions. Thus, the assessment from visual cues and common understanding of wood stain applications indicates no distinct stain differentiation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wood grain texture visible and naturally varied across all puzzle pieces, without repeating patterns or artificial smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame enclosing the dragons and compass does not depict individual puzzle pieces or typical wood grain texture. Analyzing its visual composition, there's a lack of varied, natural wood grain pattern distinctive to wooden puzzles and furniture. Instead, elements appear as uniformly textured within ornamental grooves, suggesting artificial smoothing rather than pronounced wood grain.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the puzzle pieces arranged in a physically plausible scattered layout on the wooden surface, with no floating or overlapping pieces that defy gravity or perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual analysis reveals that Image B presents the dragon patterns and compass housed within a solid, connected frame. This setup lacks any fragmented or scattered arrangement typical of individual puzzle pieces. Assessment based on spatial coherency and common perception affirm these elements do not possess a scattered layout.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the central compass retain its circular shape and fine internal details, with no distortion or loss of precision in the engraved lines and divisions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's compass is clearly circular, and the engraving within appears intricate and precise. Visual observation shows no evident distortion in shape or detail, supporting a conclusion based on optical inspection and world knowledge of compass designs, that the compass retains its circular structure and intricate engravings uniformly.",
