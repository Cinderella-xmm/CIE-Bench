    "Question": "Q1: Are the corners and edges of the hotel building preserved with consistent angles and proportions, and is there a clear transparent boundary (glass) enclosing the scene without warping or breaking the structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the building retains its basic structure with well-defined angles and edges, indicating precision in maintaining the original architectural design. However, the edited image introduces greenery flowing from the building, which does not affect the angles or proportions negatively. No explicit transparent boundary like glass enclosing the scene is noticeable, and the structure of the hotel itself remains intact without distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the water layers in the pool show consistent transparency and refraction, allowing visibility of submerged objects and swimmers without jagged edges or color artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the water in the pool maintains a realistic appearance but does not clearly show the transparency needed to reveal swimmers beneath the surface. The visibility of submerged features isn’t apparent, and there might be some issues with clarity and artifacts affecting the perception of the water's transparency.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the sunbathers on the lounge chairs have correctly proportioned limbs and recognizable clothing details, and do the nearby trees display natural leaf density and branching without pixelation or texture repetition?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows sunbathers with some diminished detail compared to their real-life appearance. The limbs and clothing lack fine details, and proportions might not be preserved accurately. The trees also seem to have an editing effect, with leaf density and branching that may not appear completely natural. The overall lack of detail undermines the realism in both sunbathers’ appearance and trees.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the greenery flowing from the rooftop follow a continuous, downward trajectory with realistic shadowing and attachment points, and does it blend naturally with the building’s exterior without floating or clipping issues?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, greenery cascades down from the building with a continuous flow without any visible clipping issues. Shadows and attachment points seem consistent with the building’s exterior indicating natural blending of the foliage with the structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the beach accessories near the pool edge correctly sized and placed on solid ground, avoiding overlap with people or furniture, and do they have natural material textures (e.g., fabric, plastic)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, beach accessories like floats appear near the pool edge, but may lack precise sizing and overlap with the pool's boundary potentially affecting realism. The materials do not exhibit clear textures revealing their nature like fabric or plastic, making it difficult to discern their placement and realism.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the floating 3D clouds exhibit soft gradients and subtle shadows, hover above the building without intersecting its structure, and maintain consistent lighting with the rest of the scene?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows clouds with an exaggerated 3D effect. They hover above the building without intersecting its structure, and the clouds maintain lighting consistent with the scene. They display soft gradients and subtle shadows contributing to their dimensionality and coherence with overall lighting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
