        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figurine inside the box seems to be proportionally consistent with the design standards of Funko Pop figures, which are known for their exaggerated 'chibi' style with large heads and smaller bodies.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting on the realistic figurine outside the box appears consistent with the ambient studio lighting that would be used in a product presentation image, matching the highlights and shadows expected.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop figure box and its contents are integrated into the image in a manner that respects the overall style and mood.
