    "Question": "Q1: Does the woman's face and body maintain natural proportions without exaggerated or distorted features such as uneven eyes, misplaced limbs, or unnatural curvature?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's body has been stylized into a chibi-like form. Chibi characters have exaggerated features, such as a large head and small body, which is characteristic of this style. This does not maintain natural human proportions as defined in the question, where natural would mean proportions seen in realistic human figures.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the floral patterns on the dress enlarged proportionally without breaking their natural shape or causing jagged edges, and do the gold highlights blend seamlessly into the fabric texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns appear simplified and stylized, matching the chibi art style. They are clear and smooth without jagged edges, but since this is a digital art style change, the highlights and texture integration are stylized rather than realistic, so the perception of 'seamless blend' is inherently different from a natural fabric.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the radiant hues applied to the dress appear smooth and evenly distributed without visible color bleeding, unnatural glow artifacts, or disrupted fabric texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dress colors are solid, vibrant, and evenly applied, typical of digital art with a smooth distribution. The consistent art style means there are no color bleeding issues or glow artifacts because the textures are intentionally simplified.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the abstract bamboo shadows align with the existing light source and cast believable depth without appearing detached, inconsistent, or overlapping incorrectly with the figure or background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the background is consistent in style, it also appears stylized, typical of digital art where depth and lighting are simplified. The shadows and light source appear consistent with the overall art style, although the realistic expectations of shadow alignment may differ in stylized art to enhance aesthetic rather than realistic positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the bamboo-shaped writing panel positioned naturally within the scene, with smooth edges and watercolor motifs that match the surrounding textures and do not exhibit harsh lines or unnatural blending?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bamboo-shaped writing panel at the bottom features stylized watercolor motifs and smooth edges that harmonize with digital art's overall aesthetic. There is no evidence of harsh lines or poor blending, with the panel complementing the art style instead of conflicting with it.",
    "answer": "Yes"
