    "Question": "Q4: Are the facial features, including the eyes, nose, and mouth, proportionally correct and undistorted, with natural skin texture and shading?",
    "explanation": "This question cannot be reliably answered from Image B due to the blurred face, which conceals the analysis of facial features. However, the question presumes the context of an unaltered section. In this scenario, adhering strictly to image content would be speculative without visible features.",
