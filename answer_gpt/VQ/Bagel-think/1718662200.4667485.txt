    "Question": "Q1: Is the head of the pig significantly larger than the body without causing visible distortions in the neck or shoulder area?",

The neck and shoulder area appears smoothly integrated with the body, characteristic of chibi designs, suggesting no distortions. World knowledge of cartoon styles allows for recognition of this proportion as intentional rather than an error.",
