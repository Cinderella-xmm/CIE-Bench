      "question": "Are the chibi-style renditions of the monitor, computer tower, speaker, keyboard, and mouse free from any unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style renditions of the computer components are presented as miniaturized versions within a box setting. The components like the monitor, computer tower, speaker, keyboard, and mouse maintain a consistent shape that aligns well with their real counterparts. The shapes are simplified yet retain the normal geometric forms associated with these objects, such as the rectangular shape of the keyboard and monitor and the boxy form of the computer tower. This chibi interpretation successfully avoids any unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes.",
