    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the statue exhibit a consistent clay-like texture across all body parts, including the face, limbs, and torso, without visible patches of mismatched material or unnatural graininess?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue seems to have a uniform clay-like texture across different body parts, such as the torso and limbs. This texture appears consistent without irregular patches or graininess, suggesting the material is well-rendered as clay.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass dome fully transparent with no visible distortion of the statue's shape or features behind it, and does it display natural reflections and refractions consistent with real glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B is transparent, allowing the statue's features to be seen clearly without distortion. The dome reflects light and refracts, indicating characteristics consistent with real glass.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lotus and wave patterns on the glass dome evenly spaced, clearly defined, and integrated smoothly into the surface without overlapping or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the lotus and wave patterns on the glass dome are evenly spaced and integrated smoothly. They are clearly defined and lack overlapping or jagged edges, evidencing careful design placement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the trident, snake, and drum exhibit enhanced golden highlights under the spotlight without visible halo effects, color bleeding, or overexposed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the trident, snake, and drum feature bright, golden highlights under lighting. These highlights are well-integrated, with no halo effects, color bleeding, or areas of overexposure, indicating controlled lighting and texture work.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the muscle contours on the statueâ€™s arms, chest, and legs accurately shaded with smooth gradients that follow the underlying anatomy and directional light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The muscle contours in Image B on the statue are detailed and exhibit smooth shading gradients, following the statue's anatomical shape and the source of lighting, giving a realistic three-dimensional effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the incense holders are positioned correctly at the base of the pedestal. They appear properly scaled and don't show signs of floating or clipping, indicating accurate placement relative to surrounding elements.",
