      "question": "Are the pastel colors applied to the octopus uniformly distributed without abrupt color shifts or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an illustration-style depiction of an octopus, where pastel colors such as pink and blue are consistently applied to the entire figure. The appearance suggests smooth transitions and fills without any visual discrepancies like abrupt color shifts or pixelated edges, which are generally avoided in illustrations or vector art styles. The observation of these attributes aligns with the typical characteristics of pastel illustrations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the brush outlines around the octopus follow the natural curves of its body and tentacles without overlapping or breaking at joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus is rendered with bold outlines that contour its shape, including the undulating tentacles. These outlines align with the smooth, continuous curves typical of the octopus' anatomy, adhering well to the body's natural form without visible overlaps or breaks at distinct joints or intersections, which often detracts from the quality of graphic illustrations if present.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waves near the shore smooth and consistent in shape, showing natural foam patterns without jagged or broken textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses an illustrative approach to depict the scene. The waves near the shore appear stylized with smooth curves and simplified shapes. No jagged edges or broken textures are visible, consistent with a graphic design style that emphasizes clear, flowing outlines and form simplicity, capturing the essence rather than exact detail of natural elements like foam patterns.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text positioned above the horizon line without intersecting clouds or causing visible distortion in the background sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is positioned prominently at the top of the illustration, distinctly separated from the horizon line. It does not intersect with clouds or cause any distortion that might interfere with the sky portion of the image. Such positioning helps maintain a clean background without clutter or visual confusion, typical in compositions where text holds significance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the octopus and surrounding terrain align with the direction of the sunset light source and maintain depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering the illustrative style of Image B, the shadows are represented through simplified graphic elements rather than realistic depiction, which doesn't necessarily illustrate depth perception or align precisely with any light source like a sunset. Graphical illustrations often prioritize form and color over realistic shadow effects, focusing more on stylistic representation.",
