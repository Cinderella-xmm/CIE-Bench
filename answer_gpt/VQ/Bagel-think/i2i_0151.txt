    "Question": "Q1: Does the kite maintain its geometric shape without any distortion or damage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the kite appears as a paper object with folded sections visible, rather than a smooth flying kite. The visual cues show creases and folds typical of paper used in crafts. Based on this analysis, Image B's kite does not maintain a fully intact or typical geometric kite shape.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there any unnatural textures on the kite that do not align with the expected paper material appearance?",
    "explanation": "The textures in Image B show clear folding lines and creases which are typical of origami or paper folding. These are expected for a handmade paper structure, indicating an alignment with the paper material appearance.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the yellow color of the kite consistent and natural against the sky backdrop, without any unnatural color variance?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the kite against a white background, not a sky. The yellow color appears consistent across the paper surface, but lacks context with a sky backdrop. Thus, there is no unnatural variance within the context shown, but there's no sky backdrop for comparison.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the kite's tail appear structurally coherent and smoothly connected to the kite body, without any visible breaks or inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible tail typical of a kite. The composition is primarily focused on folded paper structures. Without a tail present, the coherence or connection cannot be assessed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the kite string depicted naturally, free from any artifacts or unrealistic thickness variations?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows folded paper without any visible kite string. With no string present in the image, there are no artifacts or thickness variations to evaluate.",
    "answer": "No"
