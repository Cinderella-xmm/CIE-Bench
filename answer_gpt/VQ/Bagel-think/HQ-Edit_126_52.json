      "question": "Are the crystal shards aligned with the cactus ribs and uniformly distributed without gaps or overlapping clusters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal shards appear to be aligned with the cactus ribs as they follow the vertical grooves of the cactus. They are distributed uniformly without any obvious gaps or overlapping clusters, indicating careful placement along each rib. The uniform distribution is a result of each shard being spaced evenly along the ridges of the cactus. This analysis relies on understanding the typical growth pattern of cactus ribs and how decorations might be applied along these natural lines for aesthetic purposes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the luminous glyphs follow the rib lines of the cactus and emit a soft glow without causing overexposure or halo effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while crystal shards align with the cactus's vertical ribs, there are no luminous glyphs present. The crystals alone do not emit a soft glow that would cause overexposure or halo effects. Analysis shows these crystals give a vivid appearance instead of light emission. A clarification from common knowledge: vibrant colors do not equate to glow unless there's light dispersion or reflection effects explicitly showcased.",

      "question": "Is the sandstone pedestal fully grounded on the wooden surface with natural texture and no floating or clipped edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cactus positioned on a pedestal of stones instead of a wooden surface. This pedestal resembles a sandstone structure and appears securely grounded with a complete texture. There are visible vines around its base, but these do not cause any appearance of floating or clipped edges. Comparatively, Image A showcases the cactus on a simple clay pot on a wooden surface. Using world knowledge about the stability of structures and grounding, the pedestal in Image B appears naturally positioned and intact without anomalies.",

      "question": "Are the amber eyes embedded within the cactus ribs at symmetrical positions and do they show internal illumination without distorting the surrounding tissue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the amber eyes are indeed embedded symmetrically within the cactus ribs, each positioned where two ribs diverge. The internal illumination of these eyes is smooth without causing distortion to the surrounding tissue, maintaining symmetry. Given world knowledge related to artistic symmetry and structural integrity in modifications, these eyes are well-crafted into the cactus without disrupting its natural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the vine tendrils curve naturally around the pedestal and connect smoothly to the base without floating or rigid positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, vine tendrils are visibly curving and intertwining around the stone pedestal. They smoothly connect to the base without showing floating or rigid positioning. The natural curves indicate a design that mimics organic growth patterns common in nature. Through comparison, Image A lacks visible vines, but the given design in Image B demonstrates a carefully crafted organic aesthetic, adhering to typical plant growth behavior.",
