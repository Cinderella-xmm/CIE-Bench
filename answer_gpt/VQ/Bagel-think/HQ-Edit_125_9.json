      "question": "Does the textured grain overlay appear uniformly distributed across the entire image without causing visible distortion or obscuring fine details such as the soccer ballâ€™s pentagons or facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a textured grain overlay is evident, which seems to be uniformly distributed across the image. It does not cause visible distortion or obscure fine details as the pentagons on the soccer ball remain clearly visible. The editing maintains these intricate design details despite the overlay, indicating that the grain does not overpower or obscure these features.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the houses and trees retain their basic structural forms, with no broken edges or floating shapes evident. Although they exhibit a more stylized appearance, perhaps due to the graphic enhancement for the poster, they maintain recognizable silhouettes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the text \"Footy Legends\" placed across the bottom of the image in a way that does not block essential foreground elements like the soccer ball or the player's foot, and does it blend cohesively with the background without sharp edges or misalignment?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
