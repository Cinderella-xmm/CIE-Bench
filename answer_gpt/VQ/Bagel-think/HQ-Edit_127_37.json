      "question": "Does the chibi knight maintain consistent metallic texture across the armor, with no visible warping or unnatural smoothing of surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi knight's armor possesses a consistent metallic texture. The surface features expected reflections and shines associated with metal, and the contours smoothly follow the expected shape of armor without any visible warping or unnatural smoothing. This points to the image depicting a well-rendered metallic surface.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass dome visually coherent, with clear edges and realistic light refraction, and does it enclose all elements without intersecting or clipping through them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B displays coherent edges, with realistic highlights suggesting light refraction. It clearly encloses the knight, turret, and other elements within it. There are no visible intersections or clipping issues, which would be noticeable if any part of the internal elements intruded through the dome.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shield retain its embossed lion design and metallic sheen, with no visible loss of fine detail or unnatural flatness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shield carried by the chibi knight features a detailed design, although different from a lion, it maintains a sense of depth and embossed detail. It has a metallic sheen, consistent with the rest of the knight's armor, indicating no loss of fine detail or unnatural flatness.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sheep proportionally small compared to the knight, with natural wool texture and anatomically correct forms, and are they positioned on the ground without floating or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sheep in Image B are indeed proportionally small relative to the knight, reflecting expected scale in a chibi art style. Their forms appear anatomically correct, and their wool texture is appropriate for stylized figures. Additionally, they are placed on the ground without any indication of floating or clipping.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dragonâ€™s body form a continuous, non-intersecting curve around the turret, with consistent scaly texture and no visible gaps or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon in Image B is positioned around the base of the turret. It has a continuous body shape that arches without intersecting the turret, and maintains a scaly texture typical of dragon depictions. There are no visible gaps or deformation in its body, indicating a consistent and coherent portrayal.",
