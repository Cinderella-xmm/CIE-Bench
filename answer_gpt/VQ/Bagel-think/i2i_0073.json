      "question": "Does the city skyline in the mirror maintain realistic lighting and contrast, matching the ambient light of the bathroom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a city skyline within the mirror, which is a night scene with artificial lighting and a dark sky. The bathroom itself seems to have a warm, gentle ambient light due to the light fixture above the mirror. The lighting and contrast of the skyline with its bright spots and dark backdrop could stand out distinctly compared to the softer bathroom lighting, which creates a contrast but does not match the gentler ambient light of the bathroom.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and details in the city skyline clear and sharp, without unnatural blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyline within the mirror features recognizable skyscrapers with defined shapes and lit windows against a nighttime backdrop. The details appear to be crisp and without signs of significant blurring or pixelation, indicating a clear representation of the city skyline.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the skyline fit perfectly within the mirror's frame without distorting the geometric shape or overflowing its borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The city skyline is neatly contained within the mirror's dimensions in Image B. The edges of the skyline appear aligned with the edges of the mirror, and there are no visible signs of distortion or overflow, suggesting that it fits perfectly within the frame.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the city skyline in the mirror complement the bathroom's interior without clashing with elements like the marble countertop or fixtures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bathroom features a clean and minimalistic interior with a marble countertop and understated decor. The city skyline within the mirror provides a contrasting visual element due to its vibrancy and detailed city lights against the nighttime sky. While it stands out, it introduces a contemporary art piece-like visual that can be complementary by adding depth and interest, rather than clashing with the neutral and sophisticated decor.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the original bathroom elements around the mirror (such as the light above and objects on the countertop) unaffected and retain their natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bathroom light above the mirror retains its natural appearance and provides a soft illumination typical of above-mirror lighting. The objects, including the vase and soap dispensers on the countertop, remain unchanged and consistent with their appearance in Image A. The insertion of the skyline in the mirror does not seem to affect the surrounding bathroom elements.",
