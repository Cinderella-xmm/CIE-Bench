      "question": "Does the transparent acrylic display case show no visible distortion, reflection anomalies, or refraction errors that affect the appearance of the McLaren?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display case in Image B appears as a smooth and curved transparent structure encasing the car. The refraction and reflection effects are quite subtle, maintaining the clarity of the car's shape and details. This suggests a high-quality acrylic material is used, which minimizes any distortion or anomalies. Given the absence of visual distortion affecting the car, the transparent display case effectively preserves the clarity and appearance of the McLaren inside.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the polished chrome base aligned with the car's position and does it reflect light and surroundings naturally without appearing disconnected or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chrome base reflects light in a manner consistent with polished surfaces, showing a smooth, continuous reflection along its surface which aligns with the car's position. There are no signs of visual anomalies or distortions that could imply a disconnection from the car displayed above it. This suggests that the base's design and reflective properties are accurately depicted.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the carbon fiber textures confined to the interior walls of the display case and do they exhibit consistent, non-repeating patterns without visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't explicitly show carbon fiber textures on the interior walls of the display case. The question is inquiring about textures that are not visible because the display's interior walls appear to be smooth. Therefore, while the question implies carbon fiber textures are present, the current visual information does not confirm their existence. Based on the visible simplicity and smoothness of the display, the answer is based on the lack of such textures.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature wrenches and screwdrivers proportionally accurate compared to the McLaren and positioned in a way that suggests intentional placement without floating or clipping through surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a laser-etched cityscape silhouette at the base of the display, similar to a decoration feature, rather than tools like wrenches or screwdrivers. There are no items resembling tools visible, meaning the accuracy question on the positioning of miniature tools compared to the McLaren doesn't apply due to their absence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the laser-etched cityscape silhouette positioned at a consistent depth behind the car and display case, with no overlapping or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cityscape silhouette is strategically placed within the display structure, positioned to give an impression of depth behind the car. It maintains its placement relative to the McLaren and does not intersect or overlap with the car's structure, suggesting a thoughtful design that avoids clipping issues and maintains spatial consistency.",
