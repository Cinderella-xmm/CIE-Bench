      "question": "Are the iridescent wings attached to the spider’s thorax symmetrically and do they display smooth, continuous mosaic-like patterns without jagged edges or texture breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the iridescent wings on the spider's body appear well-positioned on either side of the thorax, suggesting symmetrical placement. The wings display intricate patterns that resemble mosaic artistry and flow without noticeable interruptions or jagged edges. This perceived smoothness and coherence in pattern indicate the wings are likely envisioned as symmetrical and artistically integrated with the spider's form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the luminous orb positioned where the original abdomen was, and does it maintain proportional size and alignment with the spider’s body without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminous orb replaces the spider's abdomen and appears proportionate to the spider's body, situated in a location that maintains the body's natural alignment. The orb does not seem to be floating or misaligned but instead integrates smoothly with the overall anatomy of the spider, consistent with how an abdomen should logically be attached within the anatomical context.",

      "question": "Do the golden filigree spirals wrap around each leg segment smoothly, following the natural bends and joints without breaking or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examination of the spider's legs reveals that they are adorned with golden filigree spirals that appear to wrap around each segment smoothly. The design follows the natural curvature and junctions of the legs without visibly breaking, overlapping incorrectly, or seeming out of place. This adherence to natural anatomy ensures that the enhancements are artistically fitting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fangs now thin, translucent, and needle-shaped, extending naturally from the spider’s mouth area without appearing misshapen or disconnected?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the spider's fangs appear altered to be thin and needle-shaped, projecting naturally from the mouth area. They are characterized by a translucent quality. The fangs extend with a natural appearance, maintaining a coherent form integrated with the rest of the spider's body, without visible issues of disconnection or misshapenness.",

      "question": "Does the ethereal aura surround the spider uniformly, fading gently into the background without visible streaks, sharp edges, or interference with nearby leaves or web strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the image suggests the presence of an ethereal aura encompassing the spider. This aura seems to blend softly into the surrounding environment, with no obvious harsh lines or sharp divisions. Furthermore, it doesn't visibly interfere with or cross over nearby leaves and web strands in disruptive ways, suggesting a thoughtfully blended inclusion of the aura.",
