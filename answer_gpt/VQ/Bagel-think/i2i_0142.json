      "question": "Do the textures and materials of the baseball and glove appear natural and consistent in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baseball and glove are depicted in multiple views, each showcasing their textures. The top left and bottom left images feature the baseball with visible stitching and texture that resemble a real baseball. In the glove images (top right and bottom right), there are irregular artificial patterns seen on the interior surface that do not conform to what would be expected in a real glove's texture. Thus, the materials and textures seem inconsistent, with only the outer texture aligning more with what one would expect.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the baseball and glove accurate and maintain their expected size relationships in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the images show the baseball and glove close in proximity. Typically, a baseball should fit comfortably into a glove. In the bottom right image, the proportion seems off as the glove appears smaller in cavity size compared to the baseball, somewhat negating the natural relationship. The proportionate accuracy is compromised in at least one view.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts, such as jagged edges or unnatural blending, around the baseball or glove in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B closely, especially around the seams and edges of both the objects, I observe that the objects appear visually well-blended and free of any jagged edges or noticeable artifacts. The clarity and smoothness of the surfaces indicate a high-quality rendering without visible edge artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the baseball and glove look natural and consistent with the lighting conditions in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In all three views within Image B, the lighting is consistent, highlighting the curvature of the baseball and glove with appropriate shadows in each orientation. The highlights reflect a coherent light source and are consistent across the texture of the objects, supporting the perception of a natural lighting setting.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition and layout in each of the three views (top, side, sectional) logically represent the baseball and glove in a visually credible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is arranged to show the baseball and glove from different perspectives: top, side, and sectional. While the sectional view presents a strange interior not typically expected in actual sports equipment, the overall layout provides varied perspectives that allow examination of different details. Despite the unexpected sectional details, the arrangement attempts to maintain a logical view sequence.",
