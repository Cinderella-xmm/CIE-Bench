      "question": "Do the top portions of the candelabra now appear as transparent, tapered glass caps with realistic light behavior and smooth contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each candle holder at the top of the candelabra is designed as a simple gold-finish cylinder with no indication of glass or transparency. The light reflects off its metallic surface, but there is no appearance of glass-like transparency or unique light behavior that would suggest it is glass. Thus, the top portions do not look like transparent, tapered glass caps.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arms and central shaft replaced with smooth, uninterrupted gold-finish tubing that reflects light consistently and lacks visible seams or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms and central shaft of the candelabra are crafted as smooth, gold-finished elements that consistently reflect light. There are no visible seams or breaks, giving them an uninterrupted appearance. The design ensures a clean, cohesive look, indicative of high-quality craftsmanship with a uniform gold finish.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the brand logo embossed on the base such that it blends naturally with the surrounding texture and does not introduce irregular depth or lighting anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual inspection of Image B, there is no visible brand logo on the base of the candelabra. The base showcases a floral-engraved pattern with a gold finish, maintaining consistent texture without any interruption or anomaly caused by additional elements like a logo.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floral-engraved patterns evenly distributed, following the contours of the candelabra without flattening, repeating unnaturally, or appearing as surface overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral-engraved patterns are intricately applied to the central tube of the candelabra. They follow the contours naturally, maintaining depth and consistency without appearing flattened or as surface overlays. The engraving enhances the aesthetic look by evenly covering the cylinder without any unnatural repetition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the script font label on the central tube follow the curvature of the tube naturally, without warping, stretching, or overlapping with other surface details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no appearance of a script font label on the central tube of the candelabra in Image B. The surface is marked by floral engravings, and there are no additional text elements present that would require analysis of natural following of the curvature.",
