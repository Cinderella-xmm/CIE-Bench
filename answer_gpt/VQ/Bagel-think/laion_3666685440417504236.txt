    "Question": "Q1: Are the dome, minaret, and arches inside the globe proportionally accurate and geometrically intact, with no warped edges or broken lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dome, minaret, and arches appear distorted. The dome is too small compared to its position, and architectural elements are warped rather than maintaining their original geometric integrity. These distortions indicate a lack of proportional accuracy, as visual cues alone suggest altered scaling and geometry differences, which are typically noticed through surface inconsistencies and uneven lines - conflicting with common architectural norms.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the palm trees and cobblestone path inside the globe appear at a consistent scale with the architecture and follow a plausible layout leading to the entrance?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays palm trees and cobblestone paths unusually exaggerated in size and misaligned with realistic landscaping norms. Their scale is inconsistent with the architectural elements and creates an improbable layout when assessed on visual interpretation alone, suggesting a whimsical rather than an accurate depiction of real-world spatial arrangements.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the Persian patterns on the exterior of the globe continuous, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the tilework seen on the original building?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, Persian patterns are stylistically inconsistent and unnaturally spaced. There is noticeable irregularity and abrupt style mixing when visually analyzed, contrasting with the expected detail that architectural tilework demands. Their spacing is uneven and appears simplified compared to the original image's complex and authentic tile mosaic patterns.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the golden highlights on the dome and arches applied in a way that follows natural light interaction, with no flat, overly bright, or artificially drawn lines?",
    "explanation": "Image B features highlights that are overly bright and appear artificially drawn. The nuances of real sunlight interaction, which would naturally cause gradients and subtle shading, are missing. Instead, the highlights are flat and overly pronounced, deviating from realistic depiction where golden accents enhance without overpowering the elements.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the boundary between the interior scene and the globeâ€™s surface clean and free of jagged edges, transparency glitches, or unnatural reflections?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains jagged edges and unnatural reflections around its boundaries, visibly testing coherence and clean transitions. Such artifacts are discernible without direct comparison, resulting visually from imprecise editing techniques which disrupt seamless techno-artistic harmony expected in clean design transitions.",
    "answer": "No"
