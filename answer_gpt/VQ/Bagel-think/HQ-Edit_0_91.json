    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features proportionally consistent with human anatomy, and do they maintain natural contours without exaggerated or distorted lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B are blurred, so any assessment of anatomical proportions or contour details is not possible. Considering human anatomy knowledge, the proportions typically involve natural contours without exaggeration. Given the lack of visibility, the question regarding proportions is inconclusive.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold leaf accents follow the existing pattern flow and appear integrated into the textile without unnatural highlights or floating textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, gold leaf accents appear well integrated into the textile design. They seem to naturally complement the existing floral and patterned fabric without noticeable disruption or floating textures. This suggests a harmonious extension of the design without drawing undue attention.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the enlarged hands anatomically accurate with five fingers each, proper joint structure, and natural skin texture without stretching or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands in Image B are positioned with visible articulation at the joints and maintain a natural skin texture. They retain anatomical accuracy with clearly defined five fingers each, and no evident distorting or blurring. This aligns with human anatomical knowledge.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the floral outlines extend naturally from the robe into the indigo border without sudden breaks, inconsistent linework, or misaligned patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral outlines seamlessly extend into the indigo border without visible breaks or misalignment. The pattern maintains consistency in linework, suggesting careful attention to integrating the design elements across different sections of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the textile materials retain visible texture variation and depth, avoiding flatness or pixelation that would suggest degraded quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the textile materials with clear texture variation and depth, preserving the richness and intricacy of the fabric design. There is no notable flatness or pixelation, which indicates that image quality and detail have been maintained well.",
