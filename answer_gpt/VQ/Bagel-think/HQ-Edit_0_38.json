    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the golden highlights on the grape clusters follow the natural curvature and lighting direction of the grapes without appearing as separate, overlaid patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden highlights on the grape clusters appear to follow the natural roundness and curvature of the grapes, aligning with the assumed direction of light. These highlights enhance the three-dimensional appearance rather than seem like separate patches. This natural integration suggests intentional placement that respects the form and lighting principles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the twisted vine design of the cane maintain smooth, continuous curves and proportional thickness consistent with a natural vine, without sharp breaks or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cane design resembles a twisted vine, with a consistent and natural flow. The curves are smooth, and there is no evidence of abrupt breaks or disproportional thickness changes. This helps the cane maintain an organic appearance, typical of an actual vine twisted into a cane shape.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ornate filigree details on the suit’s fabric seamlessly integrated into the existing weave pattern without visible outlines or layering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the suit’s fabric with additional ornate filigree details. These details are integrated without visible harsh outlines or layering artifacts that would suggest unnatural overlay. The filigree blends into the existing herringbone pattern of the suit, implying a seamless design that respects the underlying weave.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the vineyard-themed symbols positioned in the corner(s) of the image at a scale and orientation that integrates naturally with the composition without appearing misplaced or oversized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, vineyard-themed symbols have been added to the corners. Their size and orientation align with the overall composition of the image, integrating naturally into the frame. They do not appear oversized or out of place, suggesting careful consideration of spatial relationships in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the cane have exactly five fingers with natural positioning, skin texture, and shadowing consistent with the rest of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the hand holding the cane displays five well-positioned fingers. The skin texture and shadowing are consistent with the rest of the visible skin on the figure, ensuring a coherent representation without anatomical errors or mismatched textures.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all added or modified elements (golden highlights, filigree, symbols, cane design) rendered in colors that fall within the earthy tone range and do not introduce jarring or non-matching hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The modifications in Image B, including golden highlights, filigree, symbols, and cane design, are rendered using earthy tones that match the existing coloration of the image. There are no jarring hues introduced, maintaining a balanced and harmonious palette throughout the composition.",
