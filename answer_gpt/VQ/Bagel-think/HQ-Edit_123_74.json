    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the helmet proportionally enlarged but still maintaining a coherent shape and realistic placement on the head without visible deformation or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a person snowboarding with a helmet on. The helmet appears to have a realistic size and placement, given the posture and head tilt of the snowboarder. There are no visible signs of deformation or unnatural edges around the helmet, indicating it maintains a coherent shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural joint alignment and no signs of distortion, stretching, or additional digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals the snowboarder's gloved hands tightly gripping the snowboard. While gloves can affect finger visibility, the alignment and lack of distortion in visible segments suggest the depiction is consistent with having five fingers and natural joint alignment.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red tones on the snowsuit vivid but still consistent with fabric texture, without appearing overly glossy, pixelated, or disconnected from the underlying material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red snowsuit displays vivid tones. The texture appears consistent with typical snowsuit fabric, maintaining a coherent visual connection without glossiness or pixelation issues.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents snow and tree outlines with a stylized appearance, resembling layered paper cuts. These elements appear cleanly separated, with consistent shapes and no visible overlapping distortions or floating fragments.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the snowboarder's posture aligned with the snowboard, demonstrating balanced weight distribution. The angles of limbs appear consistent with the stance typical of snowboarding without floating or unnatural positioning.",
