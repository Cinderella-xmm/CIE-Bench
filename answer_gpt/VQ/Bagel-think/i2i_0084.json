      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dog and its blue mat appear consistent with the lighting of a snowy mountain setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and the blue mat exhibit lighting conditions that fit a snowy mountain scene, where bright ambient light typically results in soft shadows and distinct highlights. The shadows are subtle, which aligns with the high diffusion of light in snowy conditions. This supports consistency between the lighting and the environment.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and the mat seem proportionally in scale with the tents and other elements within the campsite. The scale matches typical camping setups where a dog and its mat would naturally be proportionate to human-sized tents, ensuring appropriate scaling.",
