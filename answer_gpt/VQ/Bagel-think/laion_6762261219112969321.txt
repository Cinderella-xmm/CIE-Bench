    "Question": "Q1: Do the cloud textures on the seat, backrest, and armrests appear soft, layered, and continuous without flat or blocky regions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual texture is primarily composed of spherical, bubble-like structures that together form a continuous shape resembling a creature or object made from clouds. The nature of clouds involves soft and fluffy appearances without flat or blocky regions. The design is consistent with how clouds might appear if shaped into an object, indicating a maintained soft, layered consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the wooden frame and legs replaced with branching, flowing wind-like structures that follow natural fluid motion without sharp angles or rigid breaks?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not display wooden frames or legs. Instead, the object is depicted as a singular, cloud-like form without distinct outlining structures akin to frame or legs. There are no branching or flowing wind-like structures visible, which would be characterized by smooth lines and curvilinear shapes typical of natural fluid motion. The absence of these replacements points to a different form rather than a direct transformation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the eyes positioned on the upper cushions with smooth integration into the cloud texture, lacking jagged edges or unnatural color contrasts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are eyes visible, integrated into the cloud-like texture. These eyes are designed to blend into the character-like figure, with smooth edges and harmonious color usage that avoids stark contrasts against the surrounding cloud texture. This indicates the eyes are well incorporated into the overall design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the mist trail extend continuously from the back of the sofa with consistent texture and fading intensity, without sudden breaks or unnatural boundaries?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains a tail-like trail extending from the back of the cloud-like figure. This trail has a consistent texture, forming part of the overall cloud aesthetic, and fades towards the end, closely following the visual properties of clouds dissipating. There are no abrupt cuts or jarring boundaries within the texture, maintaining a natural flow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the overall structure of the sofa preserved with proper alignment between the seat, backrest, arms, and base, without visible gaps, overlaps, or geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure does not match that of a traditional sofa with distinct seating, backrest, arms, and a base. Instead, it is represented as a unified cloud form encasing the entire shape. Because of this transformation into a singular entity, the traditional alignment and structure are not preserved, differing greatly from what is typically expected in sofa design.",
    "answer": "No"
