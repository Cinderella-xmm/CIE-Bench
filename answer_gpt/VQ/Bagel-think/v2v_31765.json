      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the diced vegetables maintain their structural coherence and visual credibility after being transformed into a Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diced vegetables are transformed into a Cubist style, which incorporates geometric forms and abstract representations. The shapes of the vegetables are altered, and they exhibit blocky and angular characteristics rather than a natural appearance. Cubism often distorts objects, presenting them in fragmented forms, highlighting a departure from traditional coherence and realism. Therefore, while the transformed image maintains geometric shapes, they do not preserve their original structural coherence typical in reality.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the diced carrots, celery, and onions natural and detailed, without any obvious loss of detail in the Cubist style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation to a Cubist style emphasizes abstraction and geometry, leading to a significant alteration in texture. The vegetables appear with smooth surfaces and lack the intricate natural texture seen in real produce, which is replaced by painterly and surreal effects typical of Cubism. This transformation results in loss of the natural and detailed texture of the vegetables as seen in reality.",

      "question": "Do the colors of the diced carrots, celery, and onions appear authentic and harmonious, contributing to the overall natural appearance in the Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits the Cubist style, characterized by vibrant and often unexpected coloration that departs from realistic representation. The colors of the Vegetables—yellow for carrots, blue-green for celery, and various shades for onions—appear more vibrant and altered from their natural hues, contributing to an artistic harmony in the composition rather than authenticity compared to real-life representations.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the diced vegetables intact and undistorted, without any broken edges or unnatural deformations in the Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Cubist style in Image B inherently introduces fragmentation and abstraction, resulting in alterations to the shapes of objects. The diced vegetables show intentional deformation, with angular shapes and broken edges, typical of Cubism, which contrasts with realistic, intact forms. Thus, the vegetables are not preserved in their original structural state.",

      "question": "Does the knife retain its natural appearance and structural integrity, without any obvious artifacts or distortions in the Cubist style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife is presented within the Cubist framework, which inherently modifies objects through abstraction and geometric interpretation. While the overall shape of the knife can be recognized, it shows color transformation and stylistic distortion, including fragmented edges and an artistic color palette, not typical of a natural appearance. Therefore, its structural integrity is altered in line with the Cubist style.",
