      "question": "Do the archways in the tower appear as articulated limbs with natural joint-like transitions, preserving their original arch shape and avoiding unnatural bends or breaks in geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the archways of the tower are transformed into articulated limbs. However, it does not have natural joint-like transitions as you would expect in actual limbs, but instead, they retain constricted areas that resemble their original arch shapes. The transformation involves adding limb-like features, but this does not create fluid, natural joints or movements, which would be characteristic of articulated limbs in terms of human or animal physiology. Thus, the architecture is maintained rather than anatomically transformed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glowing glyphs evenly distributed across the stone surface, matching the texture of the original masonry and lacking jagged edges, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On observing Image B, the glowing glyphs on the stone's surface are highlighted. These glyphs do not evenly blend with the texture of the original masonry. There are noticeable abrupt color shifts and glowing effects which differ from the natural stone texture seen in the unedited Image A. The glowing elements thus appear as digital overlays with certain degrees of discontinuity from a uniform stone texture perspective.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition from dark shadowed areas to the mystical aura around the structure gradual and continuous, without sharp discontinuities or floating light effects that lack grounding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mystical aura around the structure, particularly highlighted by the glowing elements, does not show a gradual transition. There are noticeable sharp discontinuities and isolated glowing effects that do not naturally stem from the shadowed areas, suggesting the addition of these elements was digitally imposed rather than a soft blend into the lightened areas.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the luminous guide wisp occupy the same position as the original figure and dog, maintaining proportional scale and spatial alignment, while exhibiting a translucent, wispy texture without solid edges or anatomical features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not replace the original figure and dog with a luminous guide wisp. Instead, the figure and dog are unchanged and present at the same location and scale as seen in Image A. Since there is no substitution with a luminous object, the criteria of a wisp-like form with translucent texture do not apply.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the foreground, midground, and background elements still perceptually layered with correct depth relationships, so that the golem appears to stand within the space rather than floating above or behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golem is placed within the existing spatial layout of the original structure. The edited figure maintains the depth relationship relative to other elements (like the human figure and the surrounding arches). The perspective suggests that the golem is integrated into the space properly, aligning it with the midground elements rather than appearing as disjointed or floating separately. This integration indicates the layering and positioning are perceptually coherent.",
