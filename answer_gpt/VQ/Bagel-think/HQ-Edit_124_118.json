      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the waterfall in the center of the image appear as a coherent, transparent projection with smooth flow lines and consistent light interaction, without visible pixelation or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the waterfall in the center has a digital, holographic appearance with smooth flow lines and consistent light interaction. It resembles a technological installation or an exhibit with carefully managed light play, typical in digital artwork or exhibitions that involve projections or LED displays. The waterfall does not show visible pixelation or broken geometric shapes, which suggests that the visual integrity common in digital artwork has been maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree trunks and vines in the foreground displaying iridescent fiber-optic-like strands that follow natural branch contours without breaking geometric continuity or exhibiting patchy, non-uniform glow patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree trunks and vines in Image B feature futuristic, fiber-optic-like strands that have a consistent glowing effect, wrapping around the branches and trunks. They maintain a geometric continuity, following the natural curves of the tree forms. This design choice suggests a digital art form focusing on visual cohesion and uniform lighting, without significant interruptions or uneven patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vine formations in the foreground and along the riverbanks form continuous, self-supporting loops without floating disconnected segments or geometrically impossible bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vine formations maintain structural integrity with continuous, self-supporting loops. There do not appear to be any floating disconnected segments or geometrically impossible bends. The digital artistry aims for seamlessness and natural contour adherence, in line with what is typically seen in conceptual installations involving plant-like digital forms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background landscape (distant mountains and sky) visually consistent with the foreground projections, showing no abrupt transitions, mismatched lighting, or unnatural fog effects that suggest poor layer blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the background does consist of a waterfall projection or screen, the general lighting and visual style match the futuristic and synthetic design of the foreground elements. The image, by design, is an integration of projection technology, where natural elements are rendered in digital form, minimizing abrupt transitions. However, due to the inherently artificial setting, the concept of natural consistency is embraced within the digital domainâ€”smooth integration is an intended effect rather than a flaw.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the river stones, foliage, and moss-covered surfaces in the lower portion of the image sharp and detailed, without blurred edges or repeating pattern artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures are digitally crafted to present a sharp and detailed holographic appearance. The visual detail in the river stones, foliage, and moss appears precise without evident blur or pattern artifacts. These elements are characteristic of a high-quality digital rendering, focusing on showcasing detailed, albeit stylized, components typical for digital displays aiming for realistic textures.",
