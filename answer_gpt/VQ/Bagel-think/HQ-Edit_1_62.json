      "question": "Is the enlarged hat proportionally consistent with the man's head size and does it retain natural texture and edge definition without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's hat is cartoonishly large and exaggerated in size compared to what would be typical of a human head. The texture is simplified due to the cartoon style; however, it does not show visual signs of distortion typical in cases where there is an unnatural stretch of features. The hat's edges are well-defined, consistent with traditional cartoon art styles. Compared to Image A, which shows a realistic hat, Image B maintains a cartoon logic without distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the embroidered patterns on the vest clearly defined, aligned with the fabric texture, and free from jagged edges or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vest is depicted in a simplified, cartoon style. The embroidered patterns are represented by bold, clear lines typical of cartoons, without jagged edges or color bleeding. This aligns with the artistic approach used in the cartoon medium where fine, intricate details are often communicated through simplified designs. Comparing this to Image A, where patterns are realistic and intricate, Image B's patterns suit the cartoon style without technical flaws.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the exaggerated shoe laces maintain a logical attachment to the shoe and show consistent shading and texture without appearing detached or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man wears shoes with oversized laces consistent with cartoon exaggeration. They are clearly attached to the shoes, and the laces exhibit a consistent cartoon shading style. The texture matches the rest of the shoe's cartoonish design, not showing signs of detachment or distortion. Compared to the realistic smaller laces in Image A, Image B maintains logical cartoon continuity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the man’s face and body maintain anatomical consistency, with correctly positioned features and no visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's face and body follow a cartoonish proportionality – with an enlarged head and simplified body design. This style retains internal consistency typical in caricature, without any actual warping or stretching that defies cartoon logic. The position of features like arms and torso also follows the cartoon style, which varies from the realistic proportions in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition between the man and the illustrated background smooth, with consistent lighting and perspective across the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cartoon style where both the man and the background are uniformly illustrated, resulting in a smooth visual transition. The color palette and lighting are consistently applied across the subject and surroundings, with no jarring shifts that would disrupt the scene's perspective harmony. Compared to Image A, where the realistic style has realistic lighting and shading, Image B maintains cohesion within its artistic context.",
