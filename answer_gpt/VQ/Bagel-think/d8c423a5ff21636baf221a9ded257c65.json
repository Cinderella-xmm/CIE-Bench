      "question": "Is the head-to-body ratio of the figure exaggerated but still structurally coherent, with no visible warping or misalignment of facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The head-to-body ratio in edited image B is purposefully exaggerated, typical of a chibi or stylized figure, which aims to convey a cute and endearing appearance. Despite this exaggeration, the structure remains coherent with no visible warping or misalignment, which is common in such stylized art where proportions are altered but the overall design is harmonious.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the dress is designed to have a smooth, consistent surface resembling porcelain, which is evident by the even texture and absence of rough patches or artifacts. The material appears uniform, with no unnatural glare, which is a characteristic of high-quality, stylized figures often made from materials like resin or porcelain.",

      "question": "Is the lamb positioned in the lap with sufficient volume and soft texture, and does it rest naturally within the hands without clipping or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the lamb is situated in the lap of the figure, appearing sufficiently voluminous and having a soft-looking texture, which is essential for a natural and cute appearance. It rests naturally within the hands, indicating attention to detail in maintaining realism despite the doll-like style, with no evidence of clipping or floating.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the base beneath the figure aligned with the foreground plane and does it blend seamlessly with the background without casting incorrect shadows or creating floating effects?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in image B is aligned with the foreground plane, which is evidenced by a seamless blend with the background. There are no incorrect shadows or floating effects, indicating that the figure is properly integrated into the scene, maintaining consistency with the setting and background environment.",

      "question": "Are the eyes proportionally enlarged but symmetrically placed, with no distortion in shape or spacing relative to the nose and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, while the eyes appear proportionally larger than in normal realism, they are symmetrically placed with respect to the structural cues of the face. This proportional enlargement is a hallmark of stylized figures, ensuring coherent design without distortion in shape or spacing relative to facial features like the nose and mouth.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing image B, both hands are depicted with five fingers each, aligning naturally without distortion or misalignment of joints. There are no extra or missing digits, conforming to the expected human anatomical structure even in a stylized artistic rendition.",
