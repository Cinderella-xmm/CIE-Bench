      "question": "Does the brocade gown have natural-looking folds and volume in the puffy sleeves and skirt, with no stretched or flattened areas that contradict fabric behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brocade gown in Image B appears to have natural-looking folds and volume, consistent with the behavior of thick, luxurious fabrics like brocade. The portrayal of the puffy sleeves and skirt has been done in a way that suggests realism, with no apparent stretched or flattened areas. The volume and draping of the fabric create a believable depiction of how such fabric would behave, showing a three-dimensional quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the rose blossoms evenly distributed along the branches with natural petal shapes and color variation, and do they align with the direction of light without appearing pasted or duplicated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rose blossoms are distributed along the branches in a manner that appears natural. The petals exhibit variation in shape and color consistent with real roses, and they respond to light direction appropriately. The integration of these elements into the scene does not give an impression of them being pasted or duplicated, maintaining realism.",

      "question": "Do the wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues have consistent line work, proper shadowing, and spatial alignment with the ground plane and surrounding trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues in Image B exhibit consistent line work and proper shadowing under available lighting conditions. The spatial alignment of these elements with the ground plane and surrounding trees appears accurate, demonstrating a coherent perspective and ensuring all aspects are proportionally placed within the environment.",

      "question": "Does the left hand have five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and does the right hand grip the bow in a physically plausible manner without extra digits or distorted joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the left hand has five fingers with natural spacing and curvature. The right hand holds the bow in a manner that appears physically plausible, showing no signs of extra digits or distorted joints. The hands' anatomy and positioning align with expected physical structures.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brocade patterns on the gown, the metal mesh of the gazebo, and the stone texture of the statues free from repeating tiles, pixelation, or unnatural smoothness that suggests low-resolution generation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brocade patterns on the gown, the metal mesh of the gazebo, and the stone textures of the statues do not display repeating tiles, pixelation, or unnatural smoothness. These elements appear intricately detailed and maintain their realism without signs of low-resolution generation artifacts.",
