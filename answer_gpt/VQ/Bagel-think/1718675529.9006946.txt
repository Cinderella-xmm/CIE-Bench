    "Question": "Q1: Do the wave patterns along the shoreline consist of smooth, continuous geometric curves without jagged or disconnected segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wave patterns are stylized using angular, geometric shapes rather than smooth, continuous curves. The lines depicting the waves are characterized by sharp angles and breaks, which suggest a stylized and abstract representation rather than a smooth, flowing one. This indicates that the wave patterns are not composed of continuous geometric curves.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the palm trees along the right side of the beach represented as clean, straight vertical lines without irregular gaps or misplaced branches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees are depicted in an abstract manner. They are represented by straight vertical lines and simple shapes, suggesting a clean and minimalistic representation. The absence of detailed branching or gaps implies that the palm trees are represented as clean and straight, consistent with the question.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the clouds in the sky arranged in symmetrical, repeating patterns without visible distortion or mismatched edges between adjacent cloud shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are depicted as abstract geometric shapes. These shapes appear as if they could be part of a repeating pattern due to their uniformity in style, symmetry, and arrangement. There are no visible distortions or mismatched edges, which suggests that the clouds adhere to a consistent pattern.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Is the entire scene uniformly rendered in muted greens, blues, and warm oranges, with no areas exhibiting bright or out-of-place colors such as vivid cyan or yellow?",
    "explanation": "Image B is uniformly rendered using a palette of muted tones, including greens, blues, and warm oranges. The abstract representation uses these colors in a balanced manner across the scene, without the presence of bright cyan or yellow. The consistency of color usage throughout the image aligns with the described muted palette.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the rocks on the sandy shore appear proportionally consistent with the surrounding terrain, and are they positioned in a way that aligns with the slope and texture of the beach?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rocks are rendered using angular and abstract shapes. Although these shapes might not mimic the realistic proportions found in Image A, the simplified representation aligns with the surrounding abstract terrain context. The placement and sizing of these shapes do not disrupt the visual balance of the scene; hence, they appear proportionally consistent within the abstraction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
