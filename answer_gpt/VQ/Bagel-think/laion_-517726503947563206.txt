    "Question": "Q1: Does the hull of the ship display smooth, consistent translucency and iridescent color shifts across its surface without blocky or repeated patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hull of the ship is rendered with a crystalline structure that features repeating triangular patterns. These patterns are not characterized by smooth translucency and iridescent color shifts. Instead, they seem blocky and consistent without the natural gradients associated with translucency.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the windows on the ship's decks replaced with clearly defined, faceted gem-like shapes that reflect light naturally and maintain consistent depth and edge sharpness?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the windows have been replaced with crystalline patterns similar to the hull, lacking the defined, gem-like facets. The shapes are uniform and repetitive, not exhibiting natural light reflection or depth variance typical of gems.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the deck surfaces appear as continuous, structured crystal pathways with no floating pieces, cracks, or abrupt transitions between crystal and non-crystal areas?",
    "explanation": "The deck surfaces in Image B are depicted as part of the crystalline structure but lack continuous definition. The transition between deck areas and other parts is abrupt with discernible pattern repetitions, indicating lack of finesse in transition design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the superstructure of the ship transformed into angular, faceted crystal forms with clean edges and correct proportions, without warped or collapsed geometry?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a superstructure that is angular with faceted crystal shapes. However, the geometry appears slightly warped and not perfectly proportioned, suggesting some distortion and lack of precision.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the background been adjusted to a minimalistic horizon with softened or removed distant islands, while maintaining a smooth transition between the water and sky without visual breaks or mismatches in brightness?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B remains unchanged from that in Image A, with distant islands still visible and no noticeable adjustments to the horizon line. The transition between water and sky is consistent with Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the crystal ship positioned correctly on the water surface with no floating portions or misaligned base, and does it maintain proper scale relative to the surrounding water and horizon?",
    "explanation": "The crystal ship in Image B appears to be positioned correctly relative to the water, maintaining alignment with the horizon, and is proportionate to its surroundings without floating parts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the crystal surfaces free from repetitive textures, blurred edges, or ghosting effects that suggest digital artifacts or poor synthesis?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the ship with surfaces featuring noticeable repetitive patterns and textures, as well as blurred edges that imply digital artifacts or synthesis irregularities, detracting from the overall clarity.",
    "answer": "No"
