        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents band logos that mimic watercolor art, as evidenced by the soft brushlike textures and gradients. These logos avoid sharp digital edges and resemble natural watercolor properties by having smooth transitions between colors.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the writing box is sized proportionately to the stool it is placed on, considering spatial logic. It casts a subtle shadow consistent with the light source, ensuring it appears grounded and not detached from its environment.",
