      "question": "Does the shell-like body of the creature have consistent curvature and smooth surface transitions without visible cracks, misaligned segments, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature possesses a shell-like body that appears to have a harmonious arch and smooth surface transitions. There are no visible cracks or misaligned segments disrupting the continuity of its design. The shell structure is artistically rendered, resembling an organic form with a seamless and continuous contour, suggesting a crafted and cohesive appearance.",

      "question": "Are the coral-like spires distributed organically along the back of the creature, with varying heights and irregular shapes that resemble natural coral formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B depicts coral-like spires along the back of the creature, which have irregular shapes and heights, similar to natural coral formations. These structures exhibit an organic distribution, contributing to the overall naturalistic appearance of the creature, suggesting a random and uneven growth pattern characteristic of real coral.",

      "question": "Do the glowing sea guardian spirits emit soft, diffused light that originates from their bodies and does not produce sharp halos or isolated bright spots outside their forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing sea guardian spirits in Image B seem to radiate a soft, diffused light. This illumination appears to be emitted from within their forms, creating a gentle glow without producing sharp halos or isolated bright spots externally. This effect contributes to a harmonious interaction between the spirits and their surroundings, in line with a softly illuminated scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the luminescent wave pattern behind the creature flow smoothly in the same direction as the original wake, with colors transitioning gradually from warm orange to deep red matching the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminescent wave pattern behind the creature flows in an arched direction that contrasts with the original wake of the boat in Image A. The color transition in the luminescent waves does not directly match or follow the gradient of the sunset in the sky from orange to red. Instead, the colors in the luminescent waves are predominantly cool tones like blue, contrasting with the warm colors of the sunset.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature cast a faint shadow on the water surface beneath it, and are its illuminated parts consistent with the direction of sunlight from the setting sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature does not appear to cast a discernible shadow on the water surface beneath it. The illumination and colors of the creature seem to be internally generated from its design rather than being influenced by the sunlight direction indicated by the setting sun. There is no visible alignment of illuminated parts of the creature corresponding to the direction of sunlight, indicating an artificial lighting source.",
