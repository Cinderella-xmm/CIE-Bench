      "question": "Does the text \"Catch the Wave\" appear to blend naturally with the sky without introducing any unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Catch the Wave' is prominently displayed in the sky area of the beach scene. However, upon observation, the text doesn't seem to blend naturally with the sky background. The sky has a smooth, uniform texture typical of a clear beach day, while the text has a solid black font. The contrast between the text and sky is stark, and the text introduces a noticeable unnatural element, deviating from the seamless visual expected in a natural setting.",

      "question": "Does the placement of \"Catch the Wave\" maintain the structural integrity of the horizon and waves, avoiding any visual distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the text 'Catch the Wave' is placed in the sky section and does not cover the horizon or waves directly. This placement avoids any distortion or intrusive effects on the visual elements of the horizon and waves. The placement keeps the structural integrity of the ocean intact, as it does not overlap or interfere with the natural lines formed by the horizon and waves.",

      "question": "Is the \"Summer Adventures – 2025\" note clearly legible and aligned naturally within the bottom-left sand area, without disrupting the beach's texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The note 'Summer Adventures – 2025' in Image B is placed at the bottom center of the beach area rather than the bottom-left sand area mentioned in the question. It has a black font which contrasts strongly against the sandy texture of the beach. The font introduces an unnatural element that disrupts the seamless appearance of the sand, making it less integrated with the beach texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do both the \"Catch the Wave\" text and \"Summer Adventures – 2025\" note seem logically placed and contextually appropriate within the beach scene, contributing positively to the overall visual narrative?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Catch the Wave' and 'Summer Adventures – 2025' are conceptually relevant to a beach scene, as they evoke themes of ocean activities and vacation memories. However, their visual execution in Image B disrupts the seamless natural beauty of the setting. The bold, black font of both inscriptions stands out starkly against the natural elements, which can detract from the immersive experience. In terms of placement, while 'Catch the Wave' is strategically positioned not to interfere with the waves or horizon, 'Summer Adventures – 2025' placed as it is does not align naturally with the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows and light effects around the \"Catch the Wave\" text and \"Summer Adventures – 2025\" note consistent with the lighting in the rest of the image, preserving the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays stark, black fonts for both 'Catch the Wave' and 'Summer Adventures – 2025', without any shadows or light effects that match the natural lighting present in the rest of the image. The beach setting has bright lighting typical of a sunny day, creating shadows and highlights in the natural elements. The text lacks any subtle shadowing or blending that would harmonize with this ambient light, making it appear as an overlay rather than a natural part of the scene.",
