    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the character’s head appear significantly larger than the body while maintaining smooth contours and proper alignment of limbs and torso without visible stretching or tearing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's head is notably larger than typical proportions, which is consistent with stylized or cartoonish designs. The contours are smooth, and the alignment of limbs and torso appears correct, without visible stretching or tearing. This fits well within the realm of exaggerated artistic representations where disproportion is intentional.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the character’s suit evenly distributed, free from repeating tiles or jagged edges, and do they follow a logical direction consistent with fabric draping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns on the suit in Image B are vividly colorful and do not show obvious signs of repetition or jagged edges. However, logical fabric draping typically involves patterns that follow the shape and folds of the garment; in the edited image, the abstract patterns seem to follow an artistic randomness rather than fabric logic. Considering artistic abstraction, the answer still leans towards exhibiting evenly distributed patterns.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the oversized glasses fully rendered with clear lenses and frames, aligned with the eye region, and without partial transparency or clipping against facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no oversized glasses are visible on the character, nor are there indications of lenses or frames aligned with an eye region. Therefore, the criteria for rendering glasses are not applicable in this scenario.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the hand have exactly five fingers, with natural curvature and spacing, and are there no distorted knuckles, extra digits, or unnatural shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character's hand in Image B is visually depicted with five fingers, showing appropriate spacing and curvature. The rendering of fingers appears accurate, and natural without noticeable distortions, extra digits, or unnatural shadows, maintaining artistic consistency while adhering to anatomical plausibility.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the abstract skyscrapers and balloons positioned at plausible distances, casting soft shadows, and aligned with the character’s perspective without floating above ground or appearing detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the abstract skyscrapers and balloons are positioned in the sky, following a playful and non-realistic pattern typical of surrealistic or abstract art. While there are no evident shadows, the positioning aligns well with an exaggerated artistic perspective, showing placement that is consistent within the whimsical aesthetic without any apparent detachment.",
