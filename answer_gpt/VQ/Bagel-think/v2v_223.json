        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lacework on the dress around the neck and sleeves is transferred into a 3D cartoon style.

      "question": "Are the skill bars and attributes like [Grace +10] and [Etiquette +8] placed in a way that they do not overlap with the character's dress or other important visual elements, maintaining the card's clean layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skill bars are situated below the character's image, with no overlap on the dress or blocking any significant visual elements.

      "question": "Do the title banner and name tag have consistent fonts and styles that match the Victorian era, and are their shapes and sizes proportionate to the rest of the card?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title banner and name tag use a style that appears relatively modern and simplistic, as opposed to ornate, Victorian-era designs. The fonts and styles do not exhibit the decorative characteristics that are typical of Victorian aesthetics, nor do they have shapes and sizes in proportion to the rest of the card that would suggest a historical design consistency.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warm tones in the background complement the character's dark dress, creating a contrast that enhances her presence.
