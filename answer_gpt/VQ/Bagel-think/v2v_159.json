      "question": "Do the shoes appear naturally larger without any visible distortion or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoes appear larger than typical proportions, reflecting an exaggerated, stylized design consistent with a playful or cartoonish aesthetic. This can be inferred from the bold and smooth outlines and the inflated sole shape that matches a typical animated style. Such elements make the size increase appear intentional rather than distorted. The shoes appear coherent within this artistic context.",

      "question": "Are the legs depicted in a cartoon-like style while retaining natural textures and avoiding unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The legs in Image B have a simplified, smooth texture typical of cartoon rendering. The shading and color are uniform and do not exhibit the natural textures seen in a realistic rendering, but they lack any obvious distortions or artifacts that would degrade visual quality. This style choice aligns with the overall cartoon-like presentation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the feet on the cloud-shaped shelf look natural and structurally sound, without any floating or disconnected appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet are placed firmly on the cloud-shaped formations below, without any visual indication of floating or misalignment. The cartoon style of the clouds and shoes create a cohesive visual where the feet seem well-integrated with the clouds, reinforcing the structural connection between the elements.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the overall composition, including the interaction between the shoes, legs, and clouds, visually credible and free from distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition in Image B maintains a coherent and balanced appearance. The cartoonish elements are intentionally exaggerated, yet they fit seamlessly together within the stylized context. There are no apparent distortions that disrupt the visual flow or credibility of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the textures and fine details of the shoes and legs been preserved, avoiding any unnatural textures or loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stylized approach where textures are simplified in favor of a smoother, cartoon-like aesthetic. Fine details present in realistic textures are not a focus here, as they are replaced by clear color blocks and outlines typical of this style. While not detailed by realistic standards, the textures are suitable and intentional within this cartoon presentation.",
