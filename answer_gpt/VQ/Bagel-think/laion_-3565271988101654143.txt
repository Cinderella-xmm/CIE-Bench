    "Question": "Q1: Do the holographic widgets and 3D elements on the smartphone screen appear seamlessly integrated with the device's surface, maintaining consistent depth cues and shadowing that match the phone's form factor?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone displays holographic and futuristic 3D elements that seem to float above the screen, implying a next-gen interface. A seamless integration would require that these elements visually appear as part of the device’s screen, with proper shadowing and alignment that complement the phone’s form factor. However, the holographic elements appear to float inconsistently above the screen, lacking shadows and depth cues synchronized with the device, suggesting they are not seamlessly integrated.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the forward-projection effect of the smartphone screen visually coherent, with no distortion of the phone’s frame or screen edges, and does it maintain proper spatial relationship with the hand holding it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the screen displays futuristic graphics, projecting a 3D effect. For the effect to be visually coherent, the graphics should not distort the phone's frame or edges. Observing the image, the phone's frame and screen edges remain intact, with no visible distortion. Furthermore, the projection maintains a proper relationship with the user’s hand, demonstrating consistency in the presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the biometric hand scanning overlay align precisely with the hand’s natural anatomy, showing accurate finger positions and skin texture, without introducing extra fingers or distorted proportions?",
    "explanation": "The biometric hand scanning overlay should adhere to the natural anatomy of the hand, reflecting accurate finger placement and skin texture, with no visual errors. However, Image B shows a futuristic display on the smartphone without a biometric scan overlay; thus, there's no alignment to evaluate. The display itself doesn't feature additional fingers or distortions in proportions.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the futuristic skyline displayed on the laptop screen rendered with consistent geometry and perspective, and does it align naturally with the laptop’s bezel and keyboard without clipping or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "The laptop screen in Image B shows a futuristic cityscape. For consistency, the skyline should maintain uniform geometry and perspective and align naturally with the laptop's edges. The cityscape appears well-rendered with consistent geometry, filling the screen properly without clipping issues. It aligns well with the laptop’s structure, supporting a coherent visual.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the smartphone and laptop displays share consistent visual design elements (e.g., blue color palette, futuristic typography, and interface style) that create a cohesive technological narrative without conflicting styles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the smartphone and laptop showcase futuristic interfaces with a dominant blue color palette and advanced display graphics. The styles between the two devices are visually cohesive, emphasizing a technological theme that appears unified through color and theme, without clashing design elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
