      "question": "Does the soccer ball retain its natural hexagonal pattern and smooth texture after being transformed into a halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the soccer ball's characteristic hexagonal pattern is visible, but the smooth texture is transformed due to the halftone pop-art style. This style typically involves a dotted pattern, which affects the perception of smoothness. However, the distinct hexagonal pattern is still preserved, allowing recognition of the soccer ball's design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glittering effects on the goalpost converted into the halftone pop-art style without creating unnatural textures or losing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the transformation to the halftone pop-art style in Image B, the glittering effects from Image A are replaced with dots typical of halftone backgrounds. This eliminates the sparkling glitter texture, turning it into a uniform design that loses the original glittering detail and appears less natural.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the soccer ball and the goalpost remain consistent and physically plausible after applying the halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the size of the soccer ball relative to the goalpost appears similar, maintaining a consistent and physically plausible proportion. The transformation maintains the objects' relationships and spatial arrangement without altering their respective sizes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the soccer ball and the netting of the goalpost preserved without distortion in the halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the soccer ball retains its geometric hexagonal shapes, and the goalpost's netting remains a grid pattern. The halftone style alters the texture but does not introduce distortions to these geometric shapes, maintaining the integrity of the original forms.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the soccer ball and goalpost maintain visual credibility without introducing obvious artifacts in the halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall composition and layout of the soccer ball and goalpost are preserved from Image A. The pop-art transformation applies a dotted texture but does not disrupt the spatial arrangement or introduce artifacts that compromise the visual credibility of the scene.",
