    "Question": "Q1: Does the silk robe exhibit natural fabric texture with consistent gold highlights and floral patterns that follow realistic light interaction and material properties?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robe features floral patterns and gold highlights. However, the texture appears more illustrative with a smoother, less realistic finish indicative of artwork rather than silk. The light interaction follows a uniform pattern often seen in graphical representations rather than realistic light play on fabric.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the book’s shape preserved with realistic page layers and depth, avoiding broken edges, inconsistent thickness, or floating components that disrupt its structural coherence?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the book maintains a consistent shape with well-defined pages and binding details. There are no apparent distortions in the edges, and the page thickness is consistently depicted, which suggests careful preservation of structural coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the bookshelf designs integrated without altering the original shelf alignment, spacing, or wood grain texture, maintaining visual credibility and structural rationality?",
    "explanation": "Image B changes the bookshelf design significantly, showing a more decorative, illustrated style with floral elements and vibrant colors. This alteration impacts the original alignment, spacing, and texture, which deviates from the realistic wood grain seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the bookmark panels appear correctly inserted between the book’s pages, with proper scale, orientation, and connection to the book, avoiding floating or misaligned placement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmark panel is depicted below the main book, appearing as part of the illustration. It is not visibly inserted between pages, which suggests a decorative addition rather than a realistic incorporation into the book's structure.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the facial features, particularly around the eyes and mouth, proportionally accurate and free from exaggerated or distorted shapes that compromise visual plausibility?",
    "explanation": "As the face in Image B is blurred, assessing the proportions and accuracy of facial features cannot be performed. Therefore, the blurring prevents the analysis of eyes or mouth for proportional accuracy.",
    "answer": "No"
