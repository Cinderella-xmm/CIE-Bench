    "Question": "Q1: Are the geometric shapes applied to the suit clearly defined, aligned with the contours of the body, and free from jagged or broken edges that disrupt the figure’s natural posture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the suit is constructed using geometric shapes that form distinct planes. These shapes are sharp and angular, following the contours of the body while maintaining a stylized, abstract form. The lines are consistent and unbroken, suggesting they are free from jagged or broken edges that could disrupt the natural posture. This aligns with the stylized art form typically found in polygonal or cubist designs, where shapes are used purposefully to suggest form without mimicking reality.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the chair retain a stable, grounded structure with symmetrical, flowing patterns that align with the figure’s seated position and do not appear to float or tilt unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure of the chair is abstract and does not align with traditional representations of furniture. It lacks a concrete depiction of stability and groundedness. The design is stylized, resulting in the chair appearing as a part of the abstract composition rather than a functional seat. This lack of definition in structure and symmetry gives the impression that the chair may not be stable, grounded, or appropriately aligned with the figure's seated position.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the sunset gradient in the background smooth and continuous, with no abrupt color shifts or haloing along the edges of the figure?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B shows a smooth gradient transitioning from deep orange to bright yellow, resembling a sunset. There are no abrupt color shifts, and the blending is visually smooth and continuous, which suggests an effective gradient was applied. However, around the silhouette of the figure, there is a clear demarcation rather than a natural blend, which can sometimes be perceived as haloing. Despite this, the overall gradient itself is smooth.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the metallic silver and blue areas of the suit show coherent highlights and reflections that follow a single light source and avoid repeating textures or unnatural glossiness?",
    "explanation": "The metallic silver and blue areas in Image B are depicted through abstract geometric forms. These forms provide an impression of highlights and shadows, hinting at a single light source due to their placement and brightness variance. The reflections appear consistent without repeating textures, giving the impression of cohesive highlights. However, the abstract nature limits detailed observation of reflections according to real-world light behavior, but for the stylized design, the depiction is coherent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the hand on the chair have five distinct fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and are the joints and knuckles proportionally accurate and not distorted by stylization?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the hand is highly abstract due to the geometric and stylized nature of the image. The hand's representation is not realistic and doesn't distinctly show five fingers with natural spacing and curvature. Instead, it is composed of shapes that resemble the form of a hand in position but do not capture the detailed anatomy of joints, knuckles, or fingers. The stylization affects the accuracy and proportionality expected in a realistic depiction.",
    "answer": "No"
