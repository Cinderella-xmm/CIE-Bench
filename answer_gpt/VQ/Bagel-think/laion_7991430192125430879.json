      "question": "Does the translucent green LEGO brick construction of the bottle’s body maintain a consistent cylindrical form without visible warping or misalignment between bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is constructed with LEGO bricks and appears to maintain a cylindrically consistent form without noticeable warping or misalignment. The bricks are aligned smoothly, creating a uniform shape. This is consistent with LEGO constructions where the regularity and precision of the bricks ensure a consistent form. Thus, from the visual cues, the construction seems flawless with no visible misalignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all brand text elements (e.g., \"BACARDÍ\", \"MOJITO\") and logos clearly identifiable and properly aligned on the LEGO label, without distorted letterforms or missing characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the brand text elements and logos on the LEGO label, which are clearly identifiable and properly aligned. The text 'BACARDÍ' and 'MOJITO' appear true to form without distortion, matching the typical branding style seen in commercial logos. On visual inspection, the letterforms are intact with no missing characters, ensuring clarity and proper representation of the brand.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the blue LEGO cap accurately shaped as a cylinder with consistent height and diameter matching the original bottle’s neck, and does it feature a smooth, rounded top without angular breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue LEGO cap appears to be an accurate cylindrical shape that matches the diameter of the bottle's neck. The visual impression provides that it has a smooth and rounded top consistent with cylindrical LEGO elements, without any angular breaks or irregularities. Therefore, the cap is portrayed as correctly shaped.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white shelf beneath the LEGO bottle flat, horizontally aligned, and free from irregular edges or floating segments that suggest poor integration with the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shelf in Image B is white, flat, and appears to be horizontally aligned under the LEGO bottle. There are no visible irregular edges or floating segments that detract from the scene integration, suggesting that the shelf is appropriately integrated and not causing visual confusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the smaller text elements such as \"natural mint flavor\" and \"Simply pour over ice\" fully visible and correctly spaced on the LEGO label, without overlapping or broken lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the smaller text elements such as 'natural mint flavor' and 'Simply pour over ice' are not clearly visible or identifiable due to the stylized construction of the label using LEGO bricks. These details may be obscured or omitted given the limitations of reproducing fine text with LEGO bricks, which lack the precision to display intricate text clearly.",
