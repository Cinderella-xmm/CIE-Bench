{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the Eiffel Tower and surrounding Parisian landmarks scaled down appropriately and geometrically intact, maintaining correct perspective and structural details without warping or flattening?",
    "explanation": "The Eiffel Tower and other landmarks are miniaturized within the snow globe but maintain accurate proportions and structural integrity. The elements reflect proper geometric perspective, appearing realistic and undistorted as miniature replicas.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the glass dome of the snow globe exhibit natural refraction and subtle bending of internal elements, with smooth curvature and no jagged edges or abrupt transitions?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome's curvature is smooth and consistent, causing expected slight optical distortion of the snow globe contents, which implies natural refraction. There are no sharp transitions or uneven edges, maintaining the visual integrity of the dome.",
    "answer": "Yes"
