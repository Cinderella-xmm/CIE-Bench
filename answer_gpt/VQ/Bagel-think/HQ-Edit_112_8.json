    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the text 'Stories Through Time' rendered in a serif font with a distressed gold texture that matches the typewriter’s material and color tone, and does it appear seamlessly integrated into the image without overlapping or obscuring key objects like the typewriter or lamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the text reads 'Stoods Souwert' and is rendered in a serif font with a gold color. The texture matches the typewriter's vintage appearance, creating a cohesive look. The text placement does not interfere with the typewriter or any other central elements, emphasizing design harmony. Comparison with Image A is unnecessary as the question focuses solely on aspects of text integration and appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the sepia filter apply evenly across all elements—such as the wooden desk, typewriter, lamp, and wall—without causing uneven color shifts, loss of texture detail, or artificial flattening of shadows and highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does feature a sepia tonality throughout, fitting with the vintage aesthetic but does not appear as an evenly applied filter. Details in the textures and shadows are preserved, maintaining dimensionality. An examination of Image A, which exhibits a more varied color palette and higher contrast, reveals the absence of a uniform sepia filter approach in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ghostly pages positioned around the typewriter in a flowing, semi-transparent manner, avoiding sharp edges or unnatural overlaps with solid objects like the typewriter body or desk surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ghostly pages are surrounding the typewriter, exhibiting a flowing motion. The pages don't exhibit unnatural overlap with the typewriter or desk, suggesting a strategically planned placement to ensure visual harmony and continuity in the composition. Image A does not feature these elements; thus the analysis focuses solely on Image B.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Art Deco border present along the edges of the image, featuring symmetrical geometric patterns and consistent thickness, without cutting into or distorting any central elements like the typewriter or lamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an Art Deco border is visible, showing symmetrical geometric patterns with consistent thickness. The border is carefully placed, avoiding any interference with core elements such as the typewriter. Image A lacks this border, indicating its addition is unique to Image B, which aids in framing the image rather than distorting it.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the typewriter retain its original shape, alignment of keys, and mechanical structure without visible deformation, stretching, or broken geometry despite the addition of new elements like text and ghostly pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typewriter in Image B maintains its original structural integrity, including the alignment of keys and mechanical components. The additional elements, such as text and ghostly pages, do not create any deformation or stretching in the typewriter's geometry. An assessment against Image A confirms that structural consistency is preserved between the two images, affirming the careful integration of new elements.",
