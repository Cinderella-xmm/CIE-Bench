    "Question": "Q1: Does the entire surface of the LEGO statue display uniform brick textures with no visible patches of residual wood grain or inconsistent material transitions?",
    "explanation": "The analysis of Image B reveals that the surface of the statue consists of uniform brick textures characteristic of LEGO bricks, with consistent alignment and color. There are no visible signs of original wood grain or material transitions. This suggests that the editing process successfully created a continuous LEGO brick texture across the entire statue.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the detailed carvings on the headdress, chest plate, and belt represented by small, precisely placed LEGO bricks that preserve the original patterns without loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the headdress, chest plate, and belt constructed from small LEGO bricks strategically placed to mimic the original design patterns. The LEGO bricks emulate the intricate carvings by creating outlines and shapes, maintaining the general design but likely with some loss of finer detail due to the nature of LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the arms, legs, and torso of the LEGO statue maintain natural human proportions with correctly scaled joints and limbs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO statue's arms, legs, and torso resemble the typical stylized proportions of LEGO figures, which are cartoonish and exaggerated compared to natural human proportions. The limbs are blocky, with joints and arms that do not exhibit realistic scaling reflecting an accurate representation of humanform joints.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do both hands of the LEGO statue have five distinct fingers with natural finger positioning and no signs of merging or deformation?",
    "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the hands of the LEGO statue lack detailed fingers typical of realistic hand anatomy. LEGO hands often consist of simple block-like structures without distinct fingers, reflecting a simplistic design of LEGO figures where hands do not possess individual finger articulation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO statue centered on a flat white pedestal with realistic shadows and reflections that align with the lighting direction in the gallery?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO statue placed on a flat white pedestal, with shadows and reflections that are consistent with the directional lighting in the gallery. This demonstrates an effective editing process where the statue is realistically integrated into the environment, matching lighting and perspective.",
    "answer": "Yes"
