    "Question": "Q1: Are the abstract geometric patterns on the man's robe seamlessly integrated into the fabric without introducing visible texture mismatches, jagged edges, or unnatural color shifts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man's robe features abstract geometric patterns. These patterns align well with the contours of the robe, showing a smooth integration into the fabric. There are no visible texture mismatches, jagged edges, or color shifts, which suggests the patterns have been applied seamlessly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the transformed lamp bases retain recognizable brass-like material properties and maintain proportional geometry consistent with their original structure when stylized as corner flourishes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible representations of the lamp bases from Image A. Instead, there are corner flourishes that may have been assumed to have replaced the lamp bases. There is insufficient information in the provided section of Image B to evaluate the consistency with their original brass-like properties and geometry.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the extended portion of the bookcase visually continuous with the original section, showing consistent shelf spacing, book alignment, and lighting without visible seams or distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the setting of the man is against an abstract patterned background rather than a bookcase, which indicates a significant transformation from the expected library setup seen in Image A. Thus, there is no continuity of a bookcase to evaluate in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the script elements embedded within the bookcase surface rendered with appropriate transparency and scale so they do not obscure books or create unnatural layering effects?",
    "explanation": "The script elements in Image B appear as ornate calligraphy around the man, not embedded within a bookcase, indicating that there was a thematic change. There is no bookcase or transparency effect to evaluate with these script elements, given their integration into a different stylized context.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the area intended for inspirational quotes display a clean, unobstructed region with consistent lighting and texture that allows for future text placement without visual disruption?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the area surrounding the man is designed with ornate script and pattern, offering a specific artistic style that does not feature the intended clean, unobstructed region for additional text placement without affecting current design elements.",
    "answer": "No"
