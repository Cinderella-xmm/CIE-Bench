    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the newly added matte gray background appear uniform and free of any distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is uniformly white or matte gray, and it does not exhibit any visible distortions or unnatural textures. The process of isolating the elephant seems to have been done cleanly, and the background is a solid, consistent color.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the absence of shadows make the elephant appear unnaturally floating or disconnected from the surface beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, without shadows under the elephant, it can appear to float or seem disconnected because there is no visual cue to anchor it to a surface. In images, shadows provide the necessary context for grounding an object on a surface, so their absence gives a floating appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fine details and textures on the elephant's skin preserved without noticeable loss after the background change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the detailing on the elephant's skin, such as the wrinkles and folds, which are consistent and clear. The process of changing the background did not seem to affect these textural details. Thus, there is no noticeable loss in quality or detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the absence of banana shape and metal stand curves, which were not part of the original elephant image, result in any unnatural artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon isolating the elephant in Image B, neither the banana shape nor the metal stand curves are part of the composition. Their absence does not result in any unnatural artifacts or inconsistencies related to the elephant itself, as they were not inherently connected to the elephant's natural appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the elephant retain its correct proportions and physical rationality relative to the new matte gray background, avoiding any visual distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant retains its original proportions and does not appear distorted against the matte gray background. The editing process focused on background removal and did not alter the elephant's size or shape, maintaining its physical correctness.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
