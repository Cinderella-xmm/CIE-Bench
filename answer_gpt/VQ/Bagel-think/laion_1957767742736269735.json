    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the olive and dark green LEGO bricks covering the tank's body uniformly aligned and textured, without visible gaps, misaligned blocks, or distorted shapes that break the geometric structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank appears to be constructed from LEGO bricks, featuring an outside layer of bricks that represent the body of a tank. These bricks exhibit noticeable misalignment and uneven texture, with gaps that disrupt the smooth, cohesive surface seen in solid objects or tightly constructed LEGO designs. This irregular pattern indicates that the bricks covering the tank's body are not uniformly aligned or textured.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the colorful LEGO tiger pattern on the front hull maintain the correct proportions and facial features of the original tiger decal, without distortion or missing elements such as eyes, teeth, or stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tiger pattern in Image B is composed of LEGO bricks, maintaining key facial features such as eyes, teeth, and stripes. These features are present and proportional to the original decal seen in Image A, with no obvious distortions or missing elements. The transformation to a LEGO texture, while different in material, follows the layout of the original design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the LEGO treads exhibit consistent, detailed texture resembling real tank tracks, with no flattened sections or incorrect spacing between the individual tread segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The treads in Image B are constructed from LEGO bricks, resulting in a less detailed texture that does not effectively mimic the complexity or appearance of real tank tracks. There are flattened sections and inconsistent spacing, which diverge from the intricate design typical of actual tank treads.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO tank fully supported by a smooth, continuous wooden platform that matches the surrounding ground level, with no floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO tank rests on a wooden platform that appears consistent and continuous with the ground level. There are no visibly floating or misaligned edges, indicating the platform provides adequate support for the transformation of the tank into LEGO form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the green LEGO brick back panel blend seamlessly with the surrounding environment, showing no sharp edges, unnatural color shifts, or textural inconsistencies compared to the real foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The back panel of the tank in Image B, represented by green LEGO bricks, contrasts sharply with the natural foliage in the environment. There are distinct edges and texture differences typical of LEGO bricks, resulting in an unnatural appearance compared to the realistic and organic look of real greenery.",
