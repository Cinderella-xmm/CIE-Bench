      "question": "Do the pixel-patterned facades on the skyscrapers align precisely with the original building outlines, showing no distorted edges or misaligned blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pixel-patterned facades on the skyscrapers have been edited to include a glow effect and vibrant neon colors. Observing these patterns, they do not align precisely with the original outlines of the buildings from Image A. The effect introduces some distortion in the edges and potential misalignment due to the artistic style of the edit, which focuses more on creating a futuristic aesthetic rather than maintaining strict architectural accuracy.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the angular digital circuits forming the trees connected logically from base to tip, with no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees have been altered with a digital or pixelated effect. When examining these trees, the edit does not display what would typically resemble 'digital circuits' in a logical, connected manner from base to tip. Instead, the trees appear more as abstract, glowing shapes without the structured connectivity characteristic of digital circuit designs. Thus, segments of the digital patterns may not appear fully connected or continuous.",

      "question": "Do the neon lights along the bridge run continuously along the rail tracks and side panels without gaps or incorrect bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysing the bridge in Image B, the neon lights applied along the bridge give an impression of continuity along the rail tracks and side panels, complementing the overall glowing aesthetic of the edit. However, due to the abstract artistic transformation, there might be instances of incorrect bends or gaps upon closer, meticulous inspection because the synthetic glow effects prioritize visual impact over real architectural alignment.",

      "question": "Are all skyscrapers in the skyline uniformly converted to pixel-patterned luminous towers, with no partial or missing conversions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers have been uniformly converted into luminous towers with pixel-patterned facades. This complete conversion into a uniform style indicates no omission of buildings in applying the futuristic effect. All skyscrapers in the skyline appear consistently edited to fit the theme of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the window grids on the buildings, the individual beams of the bridge, and the foliage of non-digital trees still clearly visible and undistorted after editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Detail examination of Image B shows a significant transformation, with much of the previous clarity in the window grids, bridge beams, and tree foliage obscured by the neon and pixelated effects. The visual style emphasizes a dramatic change in appearance, resulting in the distortion or masking of fine architectural details that were visible in Image A. Therefore, these elements are not clearly visible or undistorted in the edited image.",
