      "question": "Are the sails rendered as smooth, polished walnut with visible and consistent grain patterns that mimic real wood, without artificial sheen or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the materials used for the sails appear to be smoothly polished wood with visible grain patterns typical of walnut. The grain appears consistent and carefully rendered, avoiding repetitive textures or artificial sheen which would indicate a lack of realism. The representation is consistent with high-quality woodworking, where even grain visibility and polish are prized. Therefore, the construction suggests a real walnut wood feel without unnatural elements.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hull display deep, textured carvings that resemble individual walnut planks with natural variations in thickness and spacing, preserving the original boat’s silhouette without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the boat hull with deep carvings that suggest individual planks. These carvings mimic walnut texture, with varying depths that add realism to the depiction. This maintains the silhouette of the original boat as displayed in Image A. This depiction helps convey the craftsmanship associated with boat making using wooden materials where such texture is natural.",

      "question": "Is the boat positioned on a sleek, pale beige pedestal that is properly grounded and aligned with the boat’s base, without appearing to float or disconnect from the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the boat on a pale beige pedestal, which appears properly grounded and aligns visually with the base of the boat. The pedestal's design ensures it not only supports the sculpture but also appears integrated into the display setting. The seamless connection between the pedestal and the boat avoids any visual disconnect suggesting floating.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the wood tones across the sails and hull show natural variation in color and reflectivity under the ambient light, without uniformity or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the boat with wood tones that show natural variation in color and reflectivity under the sunset light. The sail and hull share gradations in tone reflecting how real wood behaves under varying light conditions. This depiction lacks uniformity, suggesting the nuanced nature of wood grain and refraction causing natural highlights.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all structural elements such as the mast, rigging, and deck preserved in correct alignment and proportion relative to each other, without stretching, bending, or missing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B reveals that all structural elements such as mast, rigging, and deck are accurately positioned with respect to each other. The proportions are maintained, and there are no signs of stretching, bending, or parts missing which could distort the overall depiction of the boat. This reflects a well-considered adaptation of structural integrity from Image A.",
