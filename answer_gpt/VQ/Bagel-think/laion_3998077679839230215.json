      "question": "Is the outline of the purple blouse magnet smooth and symmetrical, with recognizable embroidered patterns intact and not blurred or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the purple blouse featured on the magnets maintains a smooth and symmetrical outline, consistent with a cartoon-style depiction. The embroidered patterns are simplified but preserved in such a way that they're recognizable, not fragmented or blurred, which is typical for a chibi keychain representation that emphasizes clear, clean lines for visual appeal.",

      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the lehenga magnet evenly spaced and symmetrically arranged, with no broken or misaligned designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The magnets in Image B depict the floral patterns on the lehenga in a simplified cartoon format, where the designs are evenly spaced and symmetrically arranged without signs of misalignment or fragmentation. The cartoon-rendering respects the pattern's symmetry to maintain aesthetic appeal and clarity in a compact form.",

      "question": "Does the red dupatta magnet show a natural curve at the edge, with the border pattern consistently aligned and not stretched or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the red dupatta in a stylized format where the edges follow a cartoon version of natural cloth draping, maintaining a consistent and recognizable curve. The border pattern is simplified to fit the small scale of the magnet but remains aligned and undistorted, aligning with common cartoon character design principles.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jewelry elements in Image B are depicted with clear outlines and simplified details consistent with cartoon aesthetics. While the metallic sheen is represented through color variation rather than texture (typical in 2D cartoon renditions), the components are distinct and individually recognizable.",

      "question": "Is the background wall pattern magnet composed of repeated motifs that are evenly spaced and aligned, with no visible seams or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include the background wall pattern as visible elements. The focus is on the character magnets themselves, and therefore, there's no need to assess a background pattern as it's not part of the magnet designs.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the magnets are depicted with rounded edges typical of chibi keychains. The surface appears uniformly colored and appropriately glossy, consistent with standard manufacturing practices for merchandise that ensures glossy, reflective qualities to enhance visual appeal and durability.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement in Image B shows the magnets are positioned in such a way that they do not overlap each other and there is adequate spacing between them. This layout ensures clarity and distinct visibility for each magnet, consistent with display purposes where individual features are meant to stand out.",
