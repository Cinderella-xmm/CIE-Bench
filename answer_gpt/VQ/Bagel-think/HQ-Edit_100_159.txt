    "Question": "Q1: Do the muscles and body proportions of the basketball player appear exaggerated but still maintain anatomical plausibility without unnatural bulges or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the player are significantly distorted. The player's arms and legs are elongated and lack the muscle definition seen in athletic forms. World knowledge suggests that even stylized depictions retain some anatomical accuracy, but here the extremities are excessively stretched, creating an unnatural appearance. Compared to Image A, where the player has a more realistic physique and muscle structure, Image B deviates significantly from plausible human anatomy.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the colors applied to the player's clothing and skin consistent with the graffiti theme and do they retain visible texture and material properties without appearing flat or artificially oversaturated?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are extraordinarily vivid and appear heavily saturated, fitting the graffiti theme but at the cost of texture and material properties. The uniform and skin in Image B appear flat, without the depth or shading seen in Image A. Typically, even stylized images maintain some texture to suggest material attributes, which is lacking in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the hand holding the basketball have exactly five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and does it grip the ball in a physically credible manner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the player's hand is poorly rendered, lacking natural finger curvature and proper spacing. The grip on the basketball does not mimic natural human interaction with objects, appearing more like a simplified, stylized form, unlike the articulated grip in Image A where the fingers curve around the basketball realistically.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the blank graffiti-style text area clearly visible, stylistically consistent with the background graffiti, and placed in a way that does not distort the scene or obscure key elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the area intended for graffiti text is discernible in the bottom left of the image. However, it disrupts the coherence of the background due to its prominent rectangular shape, inconsistent with the dynamic, flowing style of the surrounding graffiti in both images. This white area is intrusive and detracts from the overall scene continuity seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the lighting, shadows, and surface textures of the player, basketball, and court consistent with each other and free from artifacts such as mismatched highlights or ghosting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a lack of consistent lighting and shading, leading to an overall flat appearance. The player's and basketball's textures do not reflect realistic light interaction, and the surface details that indicate texture on the court are absent, giving it a cartoonish, unrealistic appearance. In contrast, Image A has a coherent lighting scheme with realistic shadows and surface textures, providing depth and realism.",
    "answer": "No"
