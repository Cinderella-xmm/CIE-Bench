      "question": "Are the curls in the hair rendered with consistent marble texture, showing natural variations in depth and surface detail without visible artifacts such as blurring, flattening, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair appears to be rendered in a marble texture, which typically shows variations in depth and surface detail characteristic of marble sculptures. The texture should appear consistent, with natural-looking variations that are integral to marble's properties. After observing the curls, it seems they maintain a good level of detail and natural shading consistent with a marble appearance, without noticeable artifacts like blurring or flattening, which would disrupt the overall look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ornamental carvings on the neck and shoulders maintain anatomical alignment with the musculature and have continuous, coherent shapes without gaps, misaligned edges, or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the ornamental carvings align well with the underlying musculature, following the natural contours of the neck and shoulders. The shapes of the carvings appear continuous and coherent, without gaps, misaligned edges, or distortion. This indicates attention to detail in the rendering process where the ornaments are integrated with the figure's anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the angelic figures in the background depicted with clear outlines, proper proportions, and consistent depth relative to the central figure, without appearing flat, distorted, or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the angelic figures in the background are carved in marble style, with clear outlines and consistent proportions. They appear to maintain a consistent depth and perspective relative to the central figure, adding dimensionality without appearing flat or distorted. This enhances the artistic cohesion of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire image uniformly rendered in a monochrome palette with smooth gradients and no abrupt transitions between light and dark areas that suggest incomplete color conversion or artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes a monochrome palette, characteristic of marble sculptures, with smooth transitions between light and dark areas. The shading transitions are gradual, avoiding any abrupt changes that would suggest issues with color conversion or digital artifacts. This uniform rendering contributes to the sculpture-like appearance of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do both hands display exactly five fingers each with natural joint articulation and realistic proportions, without fused digits, elongated limbs, or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands can be seen to have exactly five fingers each. The fingers are articulated naturally, exhibiting realistic joints and proportions consistent with human anatomy. There are no signs of fused digits, elongated limbs, or unnatural bending, which suggests careful attention to anatomical accuracy in the artwork.",
