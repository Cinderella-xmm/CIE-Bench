      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the gold embellishments on the Dashiki naturally integrated into the fabric, showing realistic reflective properties and no floating or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold embellishments on the Dashiki in Image B appear to be distinctly placed and have reflective properties that generally align with the fabric’s contours. They do not show signs of pixelation or floating, indicating a strong integration with the fabric texture. Such visual cues suggest realistic integration, similar to how gold elements would naturally follow the fabric's folds and contours without appearing digitally imposed.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the beads and symbols on the shoulders align correctly with the shoulder anatomy and exhibit natural material textures without distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the beads and symbols on the shoulders in Image B, they appear to follow the natural slope and curvature of the shoulders. The texture is consistent with traditional beadwork, exhibiting no signs of distortion or misalignment which suggests a realistic depiction that aligns well with anatomical features.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the Acacia trees in the background proportionally accurate and structurally coherent, with natural branching patterns and no visible geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The acacia trees in Image B demonstrate branching patterns that are consistent with real-world acacia trees, possessing a coherent structure that adheres to known natural proportions. There are no visible signs of geometric distortions that would suggest artificial manipulation, indicating structural integrity and organic form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wild grass in the foreground and midground display natural variation in height, color, and orientation, avoiding repetitive or tiled patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wild grass shows a range of heights and orientations, with color variations that mimic natural grasslands. There is no apparent repetitive or tiled pattern which suggests a realistic rendering of grass as it would naturally appear in such landscapes, demonstrating ecological variability and randomness.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands show five fingers each, with natural joint alignment, skin texture, and shading that matches the rest of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands in Image B are depicted with five fingers each, showing a natural joint alignment that corresponds to human anatomy. The skin texture and shading align well with the rest of the figure, exhibiting a coherent integration within the image’s lighting and overall texture aesthetic.",
