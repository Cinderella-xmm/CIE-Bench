      "question": "Does the character's face maintain its natural appearance and texture while integrated into the soft vinyl material without visible unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the face is blurred, so we cannot directly analyze its appearance and texture based on image alone. However, considering that face blurring is typical to maintain privacy or anonymity, this blurring can introduce artifacts. In the context of soft vinyl figures, maintaining a natural appearance despite blurring might be disrupted, leading to a potentially unnatural look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the character's body proportions and posture logically consistent and visually credible within the form of a soft vinyl figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the body proportions and posture of the character are assessed based on typical soft vinyl figures which often exaggerate features for stylization purposes. The body proportions appear well-balanced, and the posture is consistent with a dynamic yet stable stance common in vinyl figure designs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the character's suit retained its detailed textures and material realism without introduction of unnatural artifacts in the soft vinyl figure design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the character's suit remains detailed with visible texture lines and realistic material representation. Soft vinyl figures often replicate such details accurately, maintaining realism without obvious artifacts, which is evident here where the suit design remains intricate and material-like.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the interchangeable accessories, such as weapons and hand gestures, integrate seamlessly with the figure's design without disrupting its structural consistency or introducing visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character holding a weapon with detailed accessories like gloves. In soft vinyl figures, accessories are designed to match the figure's scale and style. Here, the weapon visually integrates with the figureâ€™s design, suggesting a structurally consistent integration without visible artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character stand naturally on the black base without visible distortion or unnatural support, ensuring the figure's visual stability and plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the figure stands on a black base, which is a common choice for soft vinyl figures to maintain stability. The character's stance appears natural, with a balanced weight distribution that suggests plausible support from the base, thereby ensuring visual stability.",
