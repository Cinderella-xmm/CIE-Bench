      "question": "Do the iridescent emerald and gold feather patterns follow the natural feather alignment and texture of the owl’s body, without creating blocky or unnatural color transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts a highly stylized owl with emerald and gold feather patterns. These patterns are designed to fit within the concept of the digitally enhanced appearance of the owl. In analyzing the image, one can see that these feather patterns are evenly distributed across the body and align with the natural contours of an owl's feathers without appearing overly blocky or mismatched. The colors transition smoothly, giving a coherent appearance that merges artfully with the owl's body structure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mist-like wing extensions connected smoothly to the owl’s body and shaped in accordance with the original wing outline, without floating or detached segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features mist-like wing extensions that appear as ethereal structures separate from natural owl wings. In analyzing these wings, they seem to flow naturally from the body, merging with the overall form without any evident floating segments or detachment issues. The artist has ensured that these extensions align well with the general wing structure, maintaining the illusion of wings without abrupt breaks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rune-like markings integrated into the feather pattern such that they follow the natural contours of the owl’s body and do not disrupt the texture or appear as separate graphic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the edited image, rune-like markings are placed strategically on the owl's body, integrated into the ornamental design. These markings follow the contours and flow seamlessly into the feather patterns intended for this stylized view. They appear as an integral part of the design rather than as separate elements, ensuring the continuity of texture and design across the body.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the eyes retain their original oval shape and pupil structure while displaying a soft, glowing light with visible moon-like reflections, without excessive brightness or halo artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes in the edited image have been transformed to emit a glowing light with moon-like reflections while keeping an oval structure. The pupils and eye shape are slightly altered to fit the mystical theme, but they do not display excessive brightness or halo effects—maintaining a balanced glow that contributes to the owl's ethereal appearance without overpowering the visual aesthetics.",

      "question": "Are the vines wrapped naturally around the owl’s talons, with gems placed at logical junctions along the vines and no clipping or misalignment with the claws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing the edited image, the vines around the owl's talons appear to wrap in a natural and logical manner, with gems thoughtfully placed without clipping or misalignment. This design decision ensures visual coherence, harmonizing with the owl's talons and aligning with the overall artistic aesthetic consistently.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the entire owl, including its transformed features, maintain proportional alignment with the original body structure and perch, without elongation, compression, or misplacement of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the stylized owl maintains an overall body structure that remains proportionally aligned with the original pose on its perch. Transformed features do not significantly elongate, compress, or misplace body parts, preserving the original structure integrity, including the limbs and perch placement frame, to accommodate the newly designed elements practically.",
