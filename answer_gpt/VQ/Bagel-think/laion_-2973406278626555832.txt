    "Question": "Q1: Does the laboratory background in Panel 1 have consistent lighting and depth alignment with the foreground figure, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",
    "explanation": "In Panel 1 of the edited image, the illustration style suggests a highly stylized, cartoonish setting. Commonly, cartoon backgrounds do not adhere to realistic lighting and depth, focusing more on simplified forms to maintain clarity. The laboratory equipment is illustrated in a simplified manner, with no direct lighting inconsistencies apparent in this style. Thus, the cartoonish nature doesn't require photorealistic depth alignment, and elements are not floating or disconnected within the art style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the vape device held in the hand at a natural angle and proportion, with no stretching, compression, or misalignment of fingers around it?",
    "explanation": "In Panel 1, the vape device is illustrated as exaggerated and cartoonish, which aligns with the overall artistic approach in the image. The hand seems to grasp the device in a simplified, cartoonish grip. Stretching or compression is typical in this style, but the device looks consistent with how animated figures would hold objects, so it does not seem out of place or misaligned for the medium.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the vape device in Panel 1 show clear glass transparency, smooth surface reflections, and accurate labeling without pixelation, blurring, or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "The vaporizer device in Panel 1 is illustrated rather than photographic, so transparency and reflections are depicted through simplified colors and shapes. Illustrations often stylize these attributes, and in this case, the depiction maintains a consistent artistic approach. There are no evident pixelation or unnatural highlights; instead, there are graphic representations of such effects.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the internal components in Panel 2 shown with correct relative sizes and connections, such as the coil being positioned above the liquid and the airflow path following a continuous route without broken lines or impossible geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Panel 2, the illustration shows a stylized cutaway of vaping equipment components. The coil is positioned above the liquid as expected, and the airflow and other parts follow a recognizable albeit simplified form. The illustration maintains continuity and does not show impossible geometry or visible breaks in logic relative to how such components might be laid out in a cartoon context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the text bubbles and labels in both panels avoid overlapping critical facial or clothing features, and are they aligned with natural reading direction without clipping or misplacement?",
    "explanation": "Text bubbles in both panels are positioned in a way that respects the natural reading orderâ€”left to right and top to bottom. They avoid overlap with significant facial or clothing features, and there is no visible clipping in their placement. The bubbles are purposefully placed in regions that do not distract from the main illustrated content.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the hand holding the vape device have exactly five fingers with natural joint bends and no visible deformities, such as fused or elongated fingers?",
    "explanation": "In the illustration style of the edited image, the hand is depicted with exaggerated features consistent with cartoon art. While it appears simplified, the essential form of the hand includes five fingers represented in alignment with cartoon norms. There are no visible deformities like fused fingers; the style accounts for any lack of realistic detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a clean boundary between the photographic figure and the illustrated panels, with no visible seams, double outlines, or color mismatches along the edges?",
    "explanation": "The edited image employs a combination of photographic and illustrated elements. Despite this blend, the boundary where the photographic and illustrated parts meet shows no visible seams, double outlines, or mismatched colors. This clean transition is typical of digitally composited images where distinct styles are merged.",
    "answer": "Yes"
