      "question": "Does the bold black outline fully trace the crocodile's form without breaking or misaligning at joints, scales, or facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an artistic rendering of the crocodile with a bold black outline. The outline consistently follows the crocodile's form, including its joints, scales, and facial features, without any apparent breaks or misalignments. This stylized approach maintains the integrity of the original shape while emphasizing the contours.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the hat and sunglasses vividly saturated but still preserving visible texture details like knit stitches and lens reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the hat and sunglasses are vividly saturated as part of an artistic, pop-art style. However, due to the nature of this style, texture details such as knit stitches and lens reflections are not visible. The saturation serves to highlight the contrast and simplicity rather than focus on intricate textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the geometric patterns on the crocodile's skin repeat consistently across the neck, back, and limbs without gaps, overlaps, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric patterns across the crocodile's skin are consistent in style but follow an exaggerated, stylized representation that may involve overlaps or artistic distortions. While the patterns are uniform in design, the style prioritizes a bold visual impact over realistic representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the hat, sunglasses, and geometric patterns aligned correctly with the crocodile’s head and body, showing no floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and sunglasses are aligned in accordance with the stylized depiction of the crocodile, fitting properly over its head in a cohesive manner. The geometric patterns appear integrated with the body, maintaining consistent alignment. This is indicative of a deliberate artistic coherence, where all components are integrated without apparent misalignments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crocodile’s facial features, including the snout, teeth, and eye placement, proportionally accurate and undistorted despite the artistic modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows artistic modifications with exaggerated proportions and stylization. While the facial features like the snout and eye placement adhere to this style without distortions detrimental to the overall depiction, the proportions are heightened for artistic effect rather than realistic accuracy. Therefore, the features conform to the stylized image, not a proportionally accurate rendition.",
