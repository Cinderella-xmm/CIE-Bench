      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the owl's head retain proper geometric proportions with a beak that aligns with the jawline and eyes that are symmetrically placed and shaped like those of a real owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's head is anthropomorphized, derived from a mix of human and owl features. The geometric proportions appear somewhat exaggerated for stylistic effect, common in caricatures or animated depictions. The eyes are round and prominently displayed, akin to certain cartoon styles, but not necessarily mirroring the exact symmetry and proportion found in a real owl's anatomy. Thus, while displaying an owl form, it doesn't strictly adhere to realistic proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the feathers on the cloak consistent in direction, shading, and density, and do they blend naturally with the original blue color without visible seams or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feathers are clearly depicted on the cloak with artistic flair. However, the transition to the original blue color isn’t visible because the entire design has shifted to a different palette and stylization, making it impossible to assess blending without visible seams or pixelation. The feathers are stylized rather than attempting to match real or original color schemes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glasses resting securely on the beak with correct reflection and shadow placement, and do they match the size and style of typical reading glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glasses in Image B are designed to fit the animated style of the owl character. They are round, which resembles some types of reading glasses, and sit on the beak. The placement and size are suitable for the large, cartoonish owl face but don't necessarily reflect the typical shadow and reflection details seen in realistic renditions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hand replaced with a wing-like structure that has logical joint placement and feather coverage, and does it lack extra fingers or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the appendage is replaced by a wing-like structure, characteristic of an owl's anatomy. The structure does not exhibit extra fingers or unnatural bends, fitting well within the common stylization for animal wings. Hence, this modification aligns with typical animated interpretations of bird wings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the speech bubbles placed adjacent to the beak, contain legible text with contrasting colors, and do not overlap with other elements like the microphone or feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubbles are positioned near the owl’s beak. However, the text appears jumbled and is not legible, likely a fictional or placeholder language used in stylized art. The bubble does not interfere with other elements like the microphones but the legibility of the text is compromised.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the branches extend from the background with natural tapering and bark texture, and are they positioned behind the subject without casting incorrect shadows or appearing flat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branches depicted do not show detailed tapering or bark texture common in realistic depictions. They serve more as an illustrative design element rather than a realistic representation. They extend behind the owl and do not affect the perspective or depth of the scene significantly.",
