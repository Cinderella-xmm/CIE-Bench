      "question": "Do the outfits, backpacks, and skiing gear of the chibi-style skiers appear consistent with the original design and maintain their structural integrity without any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style characters' outfits, backpacks, and skiing gear are simplified representations reflecting the style. The design elements appear consistent with the chibi art style, showing no unnatural distortions like disproportionate sizes or weird angles. Chibi art inherently involves exaggerated features like heads and eyes, which are stylistically consistent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and details of the skiers' outfits, backpacks, and skiing gear preserved well, without any noticeable loss or unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the context of Image B, which adopts a chibi style, the textures and details are intentionally simplified to match the art style. There are no noticeable artifacts or quality degradation beyond this stylistic choice. The smoothness in textures aligns with common chibi design traits, where clean lines override complex textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the snowy forest setting and the arrangement of environmental elements like trees and snow remain authentic and undistorted, contributing to the overall natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an animated version of a snowy forest, with trees and snow appearing consistent with a stylized representation. The trees retain their basic shapes with snow cover, creating a coherent environment. While it is not photorealistic, it does maintain a natural, artistic interpretation of such a setting, without unnatural distortions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the chibi-style skiers' bodies relative to their surroundings physically rational and free from any geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi skiers' proportions are exaggerated by designâ€”characterized by larger heads and smaller bodies typical of the style. However, their interaction with the environment is coherent with this artistic style, and there are no irregular geometric distortions. The proportions are consistent with expectations for chibi art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the edited image, including the skiers, the snowy path, and the surrounding forest, maintain visual credibility without any inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition and layout of Image B maintain visual consistency within the chibi art style. The skiers and the surrounding environment are balanced and proportionally arranged, respecting the stylistic dimensions typical for chibi-themed environments. There are no visible compositional inconsistencies that detract from the overall scene.",
