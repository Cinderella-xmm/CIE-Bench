        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teal and white colors on the van's body appear to be applied in a consistent manner without visible signs of jagged edges or color overlaps.

      "question": "Do the chrome accents on the grille and wheels appear reflective and smooth, without any visible distortions or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chrome accents on the grille and wheels exhibit a reflective surface that is characteristically smooth and incorporates highlights reflecting light sources, consistent with real-world chrome.

      "question": "Does the roof rack with surfboards look proportionate and securely attached to the van, without any signs of distortion or unrealistic placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The roof rack on Image B is holding surfboards in a manner that looks balanced and conforms to common surf van designs, where spatial arrangement is crucial. The placement of the rack and boards appears natural and proportionate relative to the dimensions of the van's roof, exhibiting no signs of distortion or misplacement that would detract from realism. Such logical arrangement is often expected in modified images to enhance practical believability of the setup.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the overall image slightly desaturated with a warm tone, resembling an old beach postcard, without any obvious unnatural artifacts or overly processed effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has been edited to incorporate a slight desaturation and a warm tone that mirrors the appearance of vintage postcards, which commonly use faded, softer color palettes for nostalgic effect. The absence of any overt artifacts or excessive processing, which can detract from the desired vintage aesthetic, indicates a controlled editing approach aiming to evoke a specific nostalgic ambiance effectively, adhering to popular visual style cues associated with retro design.",

      "question": "Do the van's windows and doors retain their original shapes and proportions, fitting seamlessly with the new vintage surf van design without any noticeable deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows and doors maintain their integrity in terms of shape and proportion, aligning well with typical van design standards. The integration with the new color scheme and added elements like the roof rack does not obscure or deform these structural features. Consistent proportion and shape, seen here, enhance the realism and suggest consideration of original design elements even amidst a stylistic transformation, typical of well-balanced image edits.",
