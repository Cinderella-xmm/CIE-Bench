    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the wood grain on the pug's body appear continuous and natural, with no repeating patterns or unnatural stretching, especially along the spine and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pug is represented as a wooden sculpture, and the wood grain is a crucial aspect to inspect in determining natural appearance. The analysis involves examining the continuity and flow of the wood grain patterns along the spine and limbs. The grain appears to follow the contours of the pug's body in a consistent and natural manner, without obvious signs of repeating patterns or unnatural stretching that could make the sculpture seem artificial or digitally altered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and creases on the pug’s face rendered as smooth, shallow grooves consistent with carved wood, without sharp, broken, or overly deep lines that disrupt the natural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Assessment requires close observation of the pug's facial features where wrinkles and grooves should align with a wooden carving's nature. The grooves on the pug's face are shallow and follow a smooth, gradual pattern that's typical for a carved wooden texture, without exhibiting any deep or disruptive lines which would break the natural flow of a carved figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the pug’s limbs, head, and torso retain their original proportions and anatomical alignment, with no visible elongation, compression, or misshapen joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body proportions and anatomical structure of the pug sculpture need careful evaluation to check for potential distortions. Observing the head, limbs, and torso, they seem well-proportioned and aligned, maintaining the typical charming pug anatomy without signs of elongation, compression, or misshaping which could indicate error in artistic rendering or digital manipulation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the transitions between different parts of the wooden pug (e.g., head to neck, ear to head) seamless, with no visible cracks, ghosting, or color discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This analysis looks at how different parts of the sculpture join—specifically at transitions from one body part to another. The examination reveals that the transitions from the pug's head to neck and ears to head are smooth and seamless, showing no visible cracks, mismatches, or color discontinuities, indicating high-quality craftsmanship in the carving process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the black base beneath the pug flat, uniformly dark, and fully supporting the pug’s feet without any gaps, shadows suggesting suspension, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The assessment of the black base involves checking its flatness, coloration, and the support it provides to the sculpture. The base is uniformly dark and appears flat, with each part of the pug's feet properly touching and supported by the base. There are no visible gaps, shadows, or signs of misalignment that would suggest suspension or instability.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the highlights and shadows on the wooden pug match the ambient lighting of the scene, with reflections and depth appropriate for polished wood rather than fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluation of lighting involves assessing how well the highlights and shadows on the pug correspond with a polished wooden texture under proper ambient lighting conditions. The highlights and shadows appear natural and consistent with a polished wooden surface, showing reflective qualities appropriate for wood rather than fur, aligning with the lighting parameters expected in such a scene.",
