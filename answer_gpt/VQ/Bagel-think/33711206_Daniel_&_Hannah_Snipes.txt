    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes of the woman and child enlarged but still aligned with their facial structures without visible distortion or unnatural spacing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the woman and child appear to be part of a cartoon-like representation, which often features larger and expressive eyes. Based on the enlarged eyes in the illustration style, they are still aligned with the facial structures, fitting the character design without causing distortion or awkward spacing.

    "Question": "Q4: Are the added floral accents in the background consistent in size, lighting, and texture with the existing flowers and do they cast plausible shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floral accents appear to maintain consistent size and texture with a portrayal style akin to other elements within the art but lack real-world lighting interactions such as shadows. Cartoons focus more on color and size consistency than on shadows due to their simpler depictions. Hence, consistency with image texture and color is maintained, even if realistic shadows are not depicted.",
