      "question": "Does the glass display case appear transparent and free of unnatural textures or distortions that would make it look artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the display case surrounding the dog statue is made of glass and appears transparent. The reflections and refractions on the glass surfaces are consistent with how light would naturally interact with glass, helping it appear realistic. There are no evident distortions or textures that would suggest the glass was artificially imposed on the image, indicating a well-executed integration of the case.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the light focused on the dogâ€™s face well-integrated with the environment, without introducing noticeable shadows or highlights that disrupt the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting inside the display case is aligned to highlight the dog's face, and it is consistent with typical museum lighting, which tends to be soft and even. This ensures that shadows and highlights are subtle and natural, not introducing any visual disruptions or unnatural effects that would indicate poor integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dog remain proportionally consistent within the new museum exhibit setup, avoiding any distortion or deformation in its physical structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog statue appears proportionally accurate, compared to typical representations of such figures, and fits well within the display case. The angles, alignment, and proportionality are consistent with a realistic 3D object, suggesting that the dog was well-integrated without distortion or deformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the informational label about the breed and story appear naturally placed, with no jagged edges or abrupt transitions that suggest poor integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The placard in Image B is positioned below the dog statue and appears as a neatly placed composition typical in display settings. The edges are crisp, and the text is clear, with no jaggedness or apparent artifacts of digital manipulation, suggesting a natural and intentional placement.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the dog, such as fur texture and facial expression, maintained with clarity and authenticity, without becoming overly smoothed or pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog statue does not exhibit fur texture as it seems to be a smooth, artificial representation typical of sculptures rather than living animals. However, considering the nature of the object (as a likely ceramic or resin model), this smoothness is expected and does not reflect poor quality or loss of detail. There are no visible distortions or pixelation artefacts that would otherwise detract from the clarity and authenticity of the figure.",
