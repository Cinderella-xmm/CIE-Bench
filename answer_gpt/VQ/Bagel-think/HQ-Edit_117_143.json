    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the dancer's silhouette retain natural body proportions and smooth contours without distorted limbs or misshapen joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's silhouette shows well-proportioned limbs and smoothly flowing contours. The arms and legs appear to have natural joints and angles, with no visible distortion or awkwardness. This is consistent with a naturally posed figure in motion.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ruffles of the red dress transformed into flame-like swirls with smooth gradients and consistent lighting, avoiding jagged edges or disjointed shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red dress's ruffles are artistically transformed into flame-like swirls. The gradients from red to yellow are smooth, and the lighting appears consistent across the dress, giving it a fiery appearance without any jagged edges or disjointed shapes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the golden crescent moon reflection on the ground aligned with the position of the moon in the sky and does it follow realistic light reflection patterns on the tiled surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crescent moon's reflection on the ground in Image B is well-aligned with the moon's position in the sky. The reflection follows the general light reflection principles by appearing directly below the moon and fitting naturally on the tiled surface, providing a sense of depth and realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the starry night sky border blend seamlessly with the main sky background without visible edges, repeated patterns, or unnatural star clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the starry night sky continues smoothly from horizon to horizon, with a natural distribution of stars that avoids any visible edges, repetitive patterns, or unnatural clustering. The transition between different parts of the sky is fluid and cohesive.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dancerâ€™s raised hand show five clearly defined fingers with natural joint angles and no missing or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's raised hand is depicted with five distinctly defined fingers. The fingers have natural joint angles, consistent with a typical human hand, and there are no evident missing or extra digits.",
