      "question": "Does the LEGO-style minifigure maintain the subject's calm and professional demeanor without any unnatural distortions in its facial features or posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO-style minifigure in Image B replicates the professional setting seen in Image A, with similar posture and expression. Given knowledge of LEGO figures, which typically have simplified and stylized features, the depiction in Image B maintains a calm and professional demeanor consistent with a LEGO theme. The posture is upright and consistent with seated figures, suggesting no unnatural distortions. Comparing both images affirms the minifigure accurately embodies the original subject's demeanor.",
