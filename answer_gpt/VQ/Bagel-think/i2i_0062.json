      "question": "Does the chibi character maintain proper structural consistency, with the head being slightly oversized yet naturally proportioned to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is designed in a chibi style, which traditionally features characters with oversized heads compared to their bodies. This portrayal emphasizes cuteness and exaggerates certain features for stylistic effect. The head of the character is oversized as is typical for chibi designs, yet it remains proportionate and balanced with the character's arms and legs, preserving the structural consistency common to this art style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard in the scene maintains a level of detail appropriate for a cartoon style. While it does not contain intricate textures that are present in realistic images, it carries enough detail to be recognizable as a skateboard. The pattern and design are consistent with the overall cartoon setting, avoiding any disruptive elements in the scene's aesthetics.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The city skyline in Image B is stylized with simple lines and forms a coherent backdrop typical of cartoon environments. This minimalistic approach enhances the focus on the character while providing context. The background complements the chibi style by not overpowering the main character, thereby maintaining visual balance and coherence in the scene composition.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, as a stylized cartoon representation, lacks the artifacts and distortions typical of poor image manipulation processes.
