      "question": "Is the surface of the unicornâ€™s body uniformly smooth and reflective, resembling a glazed ceramic finish without patches of residual fur texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the unicorn is smooth and shiny, indicative of a ceramic or porcelain finish, lacking any fur texture. This suggests that the surface is uniformly smooth and reflective, resembling a glazed ceramic finish. Common world knowledge about such materials supports the observation that they are typically smooth and do not exhibit textures associated with fur.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mane and tail composed of thin, curved porcelain-like structures that follow the natural flow of the original hair and are securely attached to the head and base of the tail without floating or breaking apart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mane and tail are depicted as stylized, curved shapes, resembling porcelain, indicating they are crafted into thin curved forms. They appear to be securely attached to the unicorn's body without any indication of floating or breaking apart, following a natural, flowing design that mimics the movement of hair.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the horn form a continuous, symmetrical spiral shape made of reflective metallic material, originating from the same position as the original horn and maintaining proportional size relative to the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the unicorn's horns as metallic and symmetrical spirals, giving off a reflective appearance. They appear well proportioned to the head, mimicking the shape and position of the original unicorn's horn. Metal is known for its reflective surface properties and providing symmetry in designed objects, supporting this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the unicorn positioned on a flat, subtly textured stone base that contrasts with the original forest floor, with no visible remnants of trees, dirt, or foliage in the immediate surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn is positioned on a flat stone base, which appears subtly textured in contrast to the forest floor seen in Image A. The surroundings in Image B lack any elements of outdoor nature, such as trees or foliage, indicating a clear shift indoors, possibly in a gallery setting.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting on the sculpture soft and directional, casting subtle highlights on the glazed surface and porcelain curls, consistent with indoor gallery illumination rather than outdoor moonlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays soft lighting with subtle highlights on the unicorn, suggesting indoor illumination typically found in galleries. In contrast, Image A shows the outdoor environment under moonlight, which is generally harsher and less controlled than gallery lighting, indicating a shift in setting.",
