      "question": "Does the character's 3D chibi appearance maintain structural consistency and visual credibility without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character has a cute, stylized design typical of the chibi aesthetic, characterized by an oversized head and smaller body. These proportional changes are intentional and part of the chibi style, which simplifies and exaggerates features for a playful effect. There are no artifacts or distortions that break visual credibility within this stylization.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tiny evergreen trees and miniature mountain peaks inside the snow globe depicted with natural textures and shapes, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiny evergreen trees and mountain peaks inside the snow globe are simplistic but adhere to the stylized representation typical in miniature models or crafted toys. They maintain a cohesive aesthetic, avoiding any unrealistic artifacts or textures that would detract from the viewer's suspension of disbelief.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the icy reflections and gentle sparkles created by the soft daylight filtering through the frosty window appear natural and free from unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and reflections are designed to convey a cozy and soft atmosphere, typical of daylight coming through a window. The sparkles and reflections appear artistically crafted to enhance the scene's warmth and charm, without introducing any visual artifacts that might distract or seem out of place.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the snow globe resting atop a stone pedestal near a frosty window integrate seamlessly with the snowy mountain range outside, maintaining visual plausibility without any obvious distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe and its surrounding elements are crafted to provide a coherent indoor scene with a view of the snowy landscape outside. The transitions between the elements, like the snow globe's position and the visible mountainous backdrop through the window, are handled smoothly to preserve the illusion of a realistic yet stylized environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the character's shield and sword retain their proper shapes and proportions within the 3D chibi style, avoiding any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's shield and sword are represented in a chibi style, which inherently involves some exaggeration and simplification of forms. However, these items are proportionally appropriate within that aesthetic and maintain recognizability, avoiding any distortions that would compromise their design integrity.",
