      "question": "Do the vine-like tendrils follow the natural contour of the head without floating or breaking apart at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual inspection of the vine-like tendrils reveals that they smoothly contour the head, capturing the contours as if naturally growing around it. The tendrils don't exhibit any unnatural floating or breaking, demonstrating realistic adherence to the shape of the head. This observation is supported by common expectations of how such elements might organically cling and wrap around objects in natural settings.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the laurel leaves and pastel flowers aligned naturally within the hair structure without overlapping the face or appearing detached from the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Excluding the blurred face area, the laurel leaves and pastel flowers show a natural integration into the hair structure, appearing rooted and cohesive rather than detached or awkwardly placed. This placement avoids overlapping non-hair sections and suggests thoughtful and realistic arrangement akin to real floral hair adornments.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the emerald green tunic show natural fabric folds and shading that match the posture and lighting of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The emerald green tunic exhibits realistic fabric folds along with shadows and highlights which correspond aptly with the posture of the figure and the lighting depicted in the scene. This harmony between posture, light source suggestion, and fabric behavior reflects authentic textile dynamics under ambient lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the twisted olive trees and marble fragments positioned at a plausible distance from the subject, with correct perspective and no floating or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement and positioning of the twisted olive trees and marble fragments maintain plausible perspective and distance relative to the subject, demonstrating correct depth and alignment within the scene. The elements do not appear misaligned or floating, suggesting realistic environmental context and adherence to basic principles of perspective and spatial arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the subject’s face and clothing align with the ambient light source suggested by the background environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examination of the lighting and shadows on the subject’s clothing indicates congruence with the ambient light source as suggested by the background. The illumination seems to originate in a way that harmonizes with the natural ambiance, enabling consistent lighting interplay on elements like the tunic and hair adornments.",
