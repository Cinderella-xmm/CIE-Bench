    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the collectible figure design on the dresser maintain structural coherence and appear naturally integrated into the existing scene without introducing any unnatural artifacts or textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collectible figure has an unrealistic design. It appears as a small, abstract version of the dresser and mirror from Image A, lacking the detail and realism one would expect in this setting. The figure is not structurally coherent with the dresser in Image A, as its design does not represent a realistic item that would be found on top of it. The dimmed textures and simplistic look suggest an artificial overlay rather than a naturally integrated object.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportion and physical rationality of the collectible figure design consistent with the surrounding elements on the dresser, ensuring it does not appear distorted or out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collectible figure's size and proportions do not match those of the items typically placed on a dresser. The figure's size and abstract form do not integrate well with the more refined and purposefully arranged objects seen on the dresser in Image A. This inconsistency makes it physically irrational for such an environment, indicating that it is out of place.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the color scheme of the collectible figure design blend naturally with the existing elements on the dresser, maintaining the overall sense of reality and avoiding any jarring contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collectible figure's colors are more muted and lack the depth seen in the colors of the elements in Image A. The figure's color does not seamlessly blend with the dresser or the other highlighted elements of the scene in Image A, leading to a jarring visual contrast that disrupts the sense of reality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details and textures of the collectible figure design well-preserved, matching the quality and style of the other objects on the dresser, thus avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collectible figure's details and textures are minimal and lack the refinement present in the actual elements from Image A. The figure's simplistic design does not match the level of detail and realistic textures of the other objects, resulting in an unnatural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition and layout of the collectible figure design on the dresser appear logically placed, enhancing the scene's overall visual credibility without disrupting the existing arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collectible figure is placed without regard for the logical arrangement of items found in Image A. Its positioning lacks a narrative or functional purpose, failing to enhance the scene's visual credibility. This illogical placement disrupts the balanced arrangement observed previously.",
