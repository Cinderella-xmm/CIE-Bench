    "Question": "Q1: Are the orange and yellow flower petals in the headpiece free from color banding, pixelation, or sharp, unnatural edges?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the orange and yellow flower petals show signs of digital alteration, such as over-defined edges and unnatural texture transition, suggesting possible color banding or pixelation. Common issues like these occur in edited images, affecting the visual smoothness and realism of the petals.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the black, orange, and yellow braids in the headpiece maintain consistent thickness, smooth curvature, and uninterrupted strand alignment?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the black, orange, and yellow braids. They appear to maintain consistent thickness and smoothness. The alignment appears mostly uninterrupted, consistent with the typical appearance of braids, which should display evenness and flow.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the gold earrings reduced in size and repositioned on the headpiece while preserving their intricate mesh patterns and metallic sheen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the earrings appear to be in their traditional position on the ear, not reduced in size or repositioned onto the headpiece. They maintain their intricate mesh patterns and metallic sheen, which indicates no repositioning has occurred.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the flowers, braids, and earrings positioned so that they appear physically connected to the head and hair without gaps or floating elements?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows elements like flowers, braids, and earrings connected to the head and hair. They appear naturally positioned, without any visible gaps or floating elements, which contributes to the realism of the setup commonly seen in headpieces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there any visible seams, unnatural shadows, or texture discontinuities at the edges of the headpiece where it meets the face or hair?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, examining the headpiece's edges where it meets the hair, there are visible texture inconsistencies around the petals and the transition to the hair, potentially indicative of digital editing modulations that create unnatural shadows or seams.",
    "answer": "Yes"
