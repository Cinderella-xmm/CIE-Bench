      "question": "Do the metallic wing structures exhibit uniform reflective properties and smooth surface transitions without visible seams or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic wing structures display a reflective surface with a consistent pattern of lights and colors. The structure suggests a detailed design with varying textures that do not appear repetitive. The transition from the body to the wings seems smooth, and no visible seams disrupt the flow of lines, indicating a uniform reflective property.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leg-like structures derived from the minarets proportionally consistent with the rest of the structure and do they show natural curvature and joint-like articulation without stretching or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't depict leg-like structures derived from the minarets but maintains the original minaret structures. The minarets retain their straight form and vertical alignment, which does not suggest any leg-like transformation with natural curvature or articulation. As such, there is no evidence of stretching or warping that deviates from the original buildingâ€™s proportional integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the central jewel reflect light and cosmic patterns in a way that matches the direction of sunlight and surrounding environment, without appearing to float or casting inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central jewel in Image B is depicted with a bright, luminescent appearance and cosmic patterns. It projects an ethereal quality that contrasts with its surroundings, suggesting it either floats or does not entirely align with the direction of natural light. There is no clear shadow or interaction with nearby architectural elements, hinting at some inconsistency in lighting coherence.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing patterns confined to surface-level details, following architectural lines, and do they emit light that blends with ambient illumination without creating harsh glows or obscuring textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing patterns on the wings and jewel in Image B seem to emanate a distinct light that enhances certain features. However, the intensity of one of the central jewel's glow creates a harsher appearance, deviating from the softer ambient illumination that typically characterizes natural architectural lighting. This can result in some obscuring effects rather than blending seamlessly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, blurring, or color discontinuities at the junctions between the original building and the transformed elements such as wings, legs, or jewel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, there appears to be a noticeable junction where the wings attach to the building. The integration of new elements like the wings, jewel, and enhanced textures may exhibit some color discontinuities and visible seams due to the difference in visual design between added and original elements. This indicates imperfections in the editing process.",
