      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the stave church have clear, smooth surfaces with realistic reflections and no visible distortion or warping of the church beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a glass display case enclosing the stave church model. The surfaces of this glass case appear clear and smooth, based on its visual cues, as no distortion or warping is visible affecting the view of the church model inside. The space inside the glass allows for a focused view without visual noise or interruption, consistent with high-quality display cases designed to showcase objects cleanly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the layered clouds in the background panel translucent and softly blended, showing depth without blocking or distorting the mountain range behind them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds in the background panel appear to be softly layered, contributing to a sense of depth. They are not blocking or distorting the mountain range; instead, they complement it. This suggests the clouds are translucent enough to allow visibility of the mountains, a technique often used in scenic displays to create depth and realism without overshadowing other elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the small coniferous trees near the base of the church properly scaled, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the larger trees in the surrounding forest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents small coniferous trees near the base of the church within the glass display case. These trees are evenly spaced and appropriately scaled to match the dimensions and style of the model church. They reflect a consistent design theme with the larger trees depicted in the initial natural landscape photo; however, they differ slightly in realism and texture, given the modeling constraints of a display setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the mountains and sky in the background use a consistent muted palette that complements the dark wood tones of the church without creating jarring color transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains and sky within the glass display case have a muted color palette that is consistent with the church and overall surroundings. They harmonize with the dark wood tones of the stave church model, creating no jarring color transitions. The colors are chosen to maintain aesthetic unity, typically seen in dioramas to provide a cohesive visual experience.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the footprints on the snowy path subtle, evenly spaced, and aligned toward the entrance of the church, without appearing artificial or overly pronounced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible footprints on the snowy path within the display case. The area surrounding the church model seems to be enclosed and controlled, typical of a diorama, where surface details are often minimized to focus on the central object. This results in simplicity without artificiality in the backstage detailing, reducing distractions from the main display.",
