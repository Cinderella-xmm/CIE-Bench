      "question": "Does the characterâ€™s face retain natural proportions and smooth contours despite the half-cartoon style transformation, without visible distortion in facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the face is depicted in a half-cartoon style. Cartoon styles often aim to exaggerate features for effect while still maintaining a semblance of human proportions. Given this artistic transformation, the face maintains proportional features like proper alignment of ears, nose, and mouth, keeping smooth contours typical in cartoons to ensure an appealing depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the elongated book's shape geometrically consistent with a real book, maintaining uniform page thickness and aligned edges without warping or stretching artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The book in the edited image is depicted with consistent geometry that reflects a real-life book. The page thickness appears uniform, and the edges are straight and parallel, avoiding any visible warping or unnatural stretching, consistent with a real book's appearance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the sleeves exhibit natural fabric draping with consistent lighting, shadow depth, and fold patterns that align with gravity and textile behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the sleeves are illustrated with a smooth draping effect typical of natural fabric. The lighting is even, casting consistent shadow depth, and the folds conform to gravity, reflecting realistic textile behavior.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the golden filigree details on the buttons clearly rendered and integrated into the button surface without visible artifacts, such as jagged edges or mismatched reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden filigree on the buttons in the edited image appears intricately rendered, seamlessly integrated into the button surfaces. There are no jagged edges or mismatched reflections, indicating a high level of detail and refinement in the artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the library shelves transformed into a wooden frame background with consistent wood grain, edge alignment, and depth cues that maintain spatial logic and avoid broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the library shelves are depicted with a wooden frame background, where the wood grain appears consistent, and the edges align properly. The depth cues are logical, maintaining spatial coherence without any visible breaks or misaligned geometry.",
