      "question": "Does the transformed teapot maintain a uniform cylindrical shape with smooth, continuous surfaces and no visible geometric distortions or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot appears to maintain a consistent cylindrical shape with smooth, uninterrupted surfaces. The visual cues, such as the uniform reflective gold color and the lack of unusual angles or dents, suggest that the teapot has no visible geometric distortions. Combining this with world knowledge, a cylindrical teapot is expected to have this kind of uniform shape for functional and aesthetic purposes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the golden foil floral patterns clearly embossed with consistent depth, proper lighting interaction, and no signs of blurred edges or artificial textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows that the floral patterns on the teapot are embossed with a clear depth which interacts effectively with lighting, yielding distinct shadows and highlights. This indicates a high-quality embossing process. There are no blurred edges or evident artificial textures that would otherwise suggest low-quality image editing or manufacturing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the redesigned cups stacked in a stable, physically plausible manner with matching rim sizes and lids that fit securely without gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cups are stacked neatly, suggesting that the rim sizes are consistent for a secure fit. The alignment is visually straight and the lids appear to fit well, with no visible gaps. Stability in stacking cups comes from matching rim sizes and thus demonstrates physical plausibility.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Japanese calligraphy positioned at the top of the packaging with natural brushstroke variation and clear legibility, without clipping or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the calligraphy in Image B reveals smoothly rendered characters with the expected natural variation in brushstrokes. The text is clear and legible, lacking any signs of clipping or distortion that would affect readability or authenticity of the script.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bamboo motif along the side have consistent node spacing, natural grain texture, and smooth edges without repeating or distorted segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bamboo motif in Image B shows evenly spaced nodes with realistic grain texture. Edges are smooth, and there are no evident signs of repeating or distorted segments, reflecting expertise in design execution and attention to detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the surface beneath the tea set completely flat, uniformly white, and free from any unintended shadows, textures, or reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the tea set appears uniformly white and flat, lacking any conspicuous shadows, textures, or reflections. This suggests controlled lighting and editing to maintain a simplistic presentation setting.",
