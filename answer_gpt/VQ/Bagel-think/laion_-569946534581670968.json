      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the plush toy versions of the chicken wings retain the correct anatomical shape and proportions of real wings, such as the joint areas and wing tips, without deformation or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy versions of the chicken wings are made of a textile material, lacking the anatomical details like joints and wing tips present in real chicken wings. These plush wings are simple, rounded in shape, and do not exhibit the natural indentations and protrusions found in actual wings. This suggests a departure from the real anatomy and proportions seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the bright orange pillow placed inside the white bowl properly scaled and shaped to fit within the bowl's boundaries without bulging or distorting the bowl’s edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bright orange pillow is placed inside the bowl and appears to fill it neatly without any distortion or bulging over the edges. The pillow’s circular shape matches the bowl’s opening and shows a consistent alignment, allowing it to fit nicely within the bowl’s boundaries.",

      "question": "Does the light-colored wooden surface appear uniformly smooth with natural wood grain patterns and no visible digital artifacts or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light-colored wooden surface beneath the plate appears even in texture with a smooth finish, displaying natural wood grain patterns across the surface. There are no apparent digital artifacts or abrupt changes in color, providing a realistic and consistent wooden surface appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the golden-brown fabric of the plush wings display a subtle raised or granular texture that visually suggests a crunchy feel, while remaining consistent with the appearance of soft textile material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden-brown fabric of the plush wings is smooth and lacks a raised or granular texture. Instead, it presents a flat textile look typical of a soft plush fabric, which doesn't suggest a crunchy feel. This contrasts with how real fried chicken skin would appear.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the orange pillow positioned in the same location relative to the plate and wings as the original sauce was, maintaining proper alignment and depth without overlapping or floating above the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange pillow is placed inside the bowl at the same relative position as the sauce in Image A. It is properly aligned with respect to the plate and does not appear to overlap or float above the plate, maintaining a natural and consistent depth.",
