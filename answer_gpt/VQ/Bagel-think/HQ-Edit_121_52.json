    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the limbs of the astronaut proportionally consistent with human anatomy, and do they avoid unnatural bends or distortions in the joints when enlarged with zig-zag motion lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated proportions typical of chibi or stylized characters. The limbs are intentionally enlarged and simplified, aligning with the playful nature of the illustration. While not realistic to human anatomy, they do not appear unnaturally bent or distorted considering the art style, and the zig-zag lines might be part of the stylistic choice to indicate movement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the celestial motifs applied to the suit exhibit uniform texture and shading that aligns with the material appearance of the spacesuit, without visible seams or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon-like rendering of an astronaut spacesuit with celestial motifs. The texture and shading are consistent across the suit, typical of digital illustrations where smooth and uniform coloring is expected. There are no visible seams or artifacts in the depiction, suggesting a clean design finish appropriate for the illustrated style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the illustrated moon surface positioned at the correct depth and scale relative to the astronaut’s feet and shadow, with no visible gaps or misalignment between the figure and ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon surface is depicted with a stylized and simplistic appearance. The positioning of the surface relative to the cartoon astronaut does not show any misalignments or visible gaps. The illustration maintains an appropriate perspective for the scene depicted. Given the cartoon nature, the depth and scale work for this stylistic portrayal.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the astronaut’s face retain natural facial proportions and feature alignment, such as symmetrical eyes and a defined jawline, without excessive smoothing or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut’s face is styled with typical cartoon proportions, featuring large eyes and a simplified jawline. This maintains symmetry and an appealing facial alignment, consistent with stylized illustration norms. There is no excessive distortion or smoothing beyond what is typically seen in cartoon depictions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the space-themed border evenly aligned around the image edge without overlapping or cutting into the astronaut or background elements, and does the simulated card stock texture appear uniform and free of repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The space-themed border in Image B is evenly aligned around the edges of the illustration. It does not overlap or interfere with the central elements of the astronaut or celestial background. The border texture, designed to mimic card stock, appears consistent and uniform throughout, with no noticeable patterns of repetition or misalignment.",
