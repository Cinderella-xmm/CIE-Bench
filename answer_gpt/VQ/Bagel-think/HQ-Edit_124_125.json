    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the figure's raised leg and upper arm maintain continuous, smooth curvature without sharp breaks or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the raised leg and upper arm appear to maintain a smooth and continuous curvature. The body's pose suggests a fluid transition without any visible sharp breaks or disconnected segments. This is realistic for a yoga pose, as depicted, where smooth and controlled movements are emphasized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the figure's clothing and the surrounding environment (sky, sand, water) unified in tone, with no abrupt shifts or clashing hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a harmonious color scheme where the tones of the clothing are in harmony with the warm sunset colored sky, the soft sand, and the gentle hues of the water. There are no abrupt shifts or clashing hues, and the overall color palette feels unified and visually pleasing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the angle between the neck and torso consistent with human flexibility, and do the extended arms show smooth, uninterrupted lines without kinks or bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the angle between the neck and torso appears consistent with a pose that is plausible for a flexible human figure, such as a dancer or yoga practitioner. The extended arms also maintain smooth, uninterrupted lines, indicating a graceful pose without any unnatural kinks or bends.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the textures on the figure’s skin and clothing show consistent shading and fine detail without visible pixelation or smeared regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the figure’s skin and clothing with consistent shading and a smooth gradient of colors, which suggests fine detail typical of a well-rendered illustration. There is no visible pixelation or smeared regions, which may indicate high image quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the foot have exactly five fingers, each with natural curvature and proper contact with the foot, without overlapping or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, close inspection of the hand holding the foot shows a typical depiction of five fingers, each with a natural curvature and proper positioning to suggest they are holding the foot correctly. There are no missing or overlapping digits, and the depiction is anatomically correct.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the shadow beneath the figure aligned with the sun’s position in the sky and does it taper naturally toward the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadow of the figure is aligned directly beneath the figure and extends in a direction consistent with the sun’s low position in the sky, indicative of a sunset or sunrise context. It tapers towards the horizon, suggesting natural alignment and direction consistent with the lighting source.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outline of the figure around the raised leg and arm is smooth and free from visible halos or jagged edges. There are no blending errors, and the figure maintains a clean and crisp silhouette, which indicates careful detail in the editing process.",
