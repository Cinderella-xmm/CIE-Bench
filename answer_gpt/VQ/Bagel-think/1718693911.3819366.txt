    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges of the cat’s body defined by clear, continuous, and uniform bold lines that follow its natural silhouette without distortion or gaps?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the cat's body are highlighted with distinct, solid lines, characteristic of a graphic style where the natural silhouette is followed without distortion or gaps. These lines are uniformly bold and clear, which contrasts with the realistic image presented in Image A, where the cat had soft, natural edges without distinct outlines.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the color of the sunglasses uniformly flat orange without any reflection, gradient, or texture, and does it maintain the original shape and position on the cat’s face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses appear as a single flat color of orange, lacking any reflective qualities, gradients, or detailed textures typical in realistic sunglasses. They maintain their position and shape on the cat's face, similar to Image A, but diverge through the stylized graphic depiction with uniform coloring.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Has the beach background been converted into solid, non-blended color blocks for the sky, ocean, and sand, with no visible texture or natural gradient transitions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is composed of bold, solid blocks of color with no blending or gradient transitions. This represents a distinct change from the natural gradients and textures seen in Image A, providing a more abstract and artistic interpretation of the sky, ocean, and sand.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the harness depicted using a smooth gradient fill instead of realistic fabric texture, and are the shadows under the cat composed of gradient colors rather than natural light-based shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the harness is illustrated with a smooth gradient fill that lacks the detailed fabric texture present in Image A. Additionally, the shadows under the cat utilize gradient colors, creating a stylized appearance in contrast to the realistic, light-based shading observed in the original image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

```json
{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all major elements in the image—including the cat, sunglasses, hot dog, and background—rendered exclusively in red, blue, or yellow, with no other colors present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the major elements are indeed rendered in bold colors characteristic of a limited palette, primarily using red, blue, and yellow. This vibrant color choice contrasts with Image A, where a broader range of colors and realistic hues were used, indicating a significant stylistic shift.",
    "answer": "Yes"
