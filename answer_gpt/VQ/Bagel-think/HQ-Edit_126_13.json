      "question": "Do the annotated lines representing the tea journey follow a smooth, non-intersecting path around the tea set without overlapping or deforming the original objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the annotated lines seem to create paths connecting different parts of the tea set. The design of these lines is such that they move around the objects without appearing to interfere or overlap with them, suggesting an organized path. However, a closer observation reveals a complexity with the paths potentially intersecting with the objects or not appearing smooth, as indicated by the fact that the lines have to work around spatial constraints between the objects. The lines have been added post-original design, resulting in some visual tension.",

      "question": "Is the handwritten calligraphy in soft pastel green seamlessly integrated into the scene without causing visual contrast or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calligraphy text in pastel green is an additional graphic element not present in the original setup. Although pastel green is generally a gentle and soft color that might seem less intrusive, its integration depends on how it interacts with the other elements of the scene, including shadows, textures, and color balance. The letters stand out against the muted background, and their texture seems slightly different from that of the objects it overlaps, creating a mild visual disruption.",

      "question": "Are the minimalist icons for each step of the tea journey proportionally scaled and visually coherent with the surrounding objects and layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The minimalist icons in Image B represent various steps of a 'tea journey' and are placed beside the main objects. They appear to be uniformly styled and placed in a manner that attempts to complement the existing objects. However, for proportional scaling, these icons do not match the scale of the real objects, such as the teapot or vase, and hence appear somewhat oversized and lack coherence with the real-world context of the table setup.",

      "question": "Do the added cherry blossom petals appear to float or fall naturally in the air without unnatural positioning or missing shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossom petals seem to be floating through the air. For the effect to appear natural, petals should have a realistic spatial orientation and should cast shadows in alignment with light sources. Without visible shadows, the petals may not seem grounded in a three-dimensional space. Coupled with their seemingly random placement, this affects the perception of movement and natural appearance.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the table mat, teapot, cup, and vase preserved without visible distortion, blurring, or artificial seams where new elements were added?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the core textures of the main objects (table mat, teapot, cup, and vase) initially maintain their clarity and distinctiveness from Image A. However, despite this, the editing process might have unintentionally induced some inconsistencies at the juncture of integration with new graphical elements. Such inconsistencies often manifest as subtle blurring or altered textures, indicating that the integration was not entirely seamless.",
