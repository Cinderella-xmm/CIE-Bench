    "Question": "Q1: Does the transition area between the painting and the wall maintain the natural texture of the wall material without introducing obvious artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, observe the junction where the painting meets the wall. The transition area should smoothly blend, and the wall's texture should remain consistent with the surrounding areas. There should be no visible signs of editing such as uneven edges or digital artifacts that disrupt the natural surface of the wall. The wall maintains an even, smooth surface without disruptions in texture or color.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the proportions of the trees and water in the painting maintained realistically without appearing stretched or distorted?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the painting features a landscape with trees and water. The proportions and perspective in the painting should appear natural and consistent with real landscapes, featuring normal dimensions and without signs of alteration such as elongation or disproportionate scales of objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the shadows and lighting in the painting align consistently with the room's light source, avoiding unnatural contrasts or disruptions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the painting should harmonize with the room's ambient lighting. The painting shows a sunset scene, and the hues should complement the direction and intensity of natural light entering the room, which comes from the right side. If the shadows and highlights within the painting's scene and the room do not clash, it indicates a consistency in the depiction of light.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the painting preserve its depth and layering, creating a believable 3D effect without disrupting its visual coherence?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, observe the details within the painting, focusing on the layers of trees and the reflection on the water. The painting successfully uses color gradients and shading to create a sense of depth and perspective. The layering should provide a 3D visual effect without any flattening or unrealistic alterations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the frame around the painting retain its structural integrity and material appearance without visible damage or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the frame surrounding the painting should appear intact and consistent in texture and material appearance. There should be no discrepancies such as pixelated edges or varying materials, which would suggest an editing oversight. The frame is uniform and solid around the painting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
