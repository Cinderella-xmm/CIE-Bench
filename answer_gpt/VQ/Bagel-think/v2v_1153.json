      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings have a distinctly modern and sleek appearance with cool blue tones.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossom trees and pagoda maintain their traditional aesthetic alongside the modernized buildings. The seamless integration is suggested through the coherent distribution of elements and the color harmony between the warm pink tones of the blossoms and the cooler blues of the buildings. These visual cues are indicative of a well-blended scene where none of the components appear jarring or incongruous.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural forms and perspectives remain consistent and logical. The buildings, especially their vertical structures and roof lines, do not show signs of distortion or disproportion. Their geometric shapes align with expected architectural principles, respecting the laws of perspective and uniformity in size and angle throughout the scene.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases clear and precise detailing on the buildings, including window frames and roof edges. These elements are sharply rendered, indicating no unnatural textures that might distract from the overall realism of the architecture. The detailing adheres to expected architectural features, which are essential for a polished aesthetic.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition is thoughtfully arranged, with a balance between the built structures and natural elements. The scene retains harmony through proportional spacing and alignment of architectural elements with the natural environment. This careful layout results in a visually credible scene that feels cohesive and artistically balanced.",
