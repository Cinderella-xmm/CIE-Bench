      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the wing-shaped shelves formed from the original bookshelves smooth and continuous without jagged edges or missing segments, and do they feature leaf textures that blend naturally with the wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the wing-shaped shelves are carved out of the bookshelf spaces, creating an organic design that appears smooth and continuous without jagged edges or missing segments. The visual cues suggest that leaf-like textures are incorporated, allowing the wings to naturally blend with the wooden structure of the shelves, providing a seamless transition. Combining world knowledge about natural design elements, it's typical to see motifs that mimic organic shapes to enhance the aesthetic appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hanging fungi occupy the same positions as the original lamps, have rounded caps and stems resembling real mushrooms, and display a soft glow without visible artifacts or unnatural brightness gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fungi appear to replace the hanging lamps from Image A in identical positions. They exhibit rounded caps and elongated stems, mimicking the appearance of real mushrooms. The glow emitted by the fungi is soft and diffused, consistent with realistic lighting effects, without visible artifacts or unnatural brightness gradients, suggesting careful attention to the integration of these elements into the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the chair and stool replacements shaped like natural rocks with uneven surfaces and moss coverage that follows realistic growth patterns, and do they retain a size suitable for human seating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the seating replaced by rock-like formations which indeed have irregular surfaces, simulating natural rock texture. The moss appears to grow in a realistic pattern over these rocks, adding authenticity to their appearance. The size of these formations remains adequate for human seating, as they occupy similar spaces to the original chairs and stools seen in Image A, suggesting thoughtful design to ensure functionality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the book-to-bird transformations show complete bird bodies with defined heads, wings, and tails, and do the feathers contain readable text fragments arranged in a natural pattern without distorted letters or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation of books into bird figures presents complete bird bodies with distinctive features such as heads, wings, and tails. The feathers are designed with text fragments that seem purposefully arranged to form a natural pattern. This transformation focuses on maintaining an aesthetic coherence and readability, avoiding distortions or gaps in the text, which fits within the fantasy design language where elements incorporate whimsical yet coherent details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the entwined branches forming the ceiling connected and interlaced in a natural way without gaps or floating segments, and do they cast shadow patterns that align with the light source direction seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ceiling in Image B is composed of entwined branches that show a natural connectivity and interlacing, avoiding any visible gaps or segments that appear floating. The shadow patterns cast by these branches align logically considering the light source direction as depicted in Image A, indicating that the shadows in Image B follow the same principles, ensuring consistent lighting and realism in the transformation from constructed beams to a natural canopy.",
