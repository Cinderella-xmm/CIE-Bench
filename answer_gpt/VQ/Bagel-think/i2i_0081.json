      "question": "Do the neon lighting effects seamlessly integrate with the mirror reflection, avoiding any artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon lighting effect is applied around the mirror and sink area. The reflection in the mirror is very consistent with the applied lighting effect, showing no signs of distortion or artifacts that would disrupt the seamless integration. This suggests a high-quality editing process where visual coherence between lighting effects and reflective surfaces is maintained.",

      "question": "Does the gradient background complement the sink area geometry, maintaining structural coherence and avoiding broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a gradient background applied, transitioning from a pink to a purple hue. This background retains consistent texture across the wall and does not interfere with the geometric shapes of the sink or cabinet, maintaining structural coherence. The gradient effect enhances the overall visual aesthetics without distorting or breaking the geometric integrity of the sink area.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the materials and textures of the black cabinet visually credible, retaining fine details and avoiding unnatural changes after applying the vaporwave style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the overall change to a vaporwave style, the textures and materials of the cabinet retain their credibility. The sleek, smooth surface characteristic of such a design is maintained. The cabinet appears visually consistent in terms of material property, even under the influence of altered lighting conditions from the vaporwave style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the faucet and soap dispenser area retained their natural appearance without any loss of detail or introduction of artifacts during the vaporwave style conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the faucet and soap dispenser retain their details and appear as natural as in a standard image. They are clear and recognizable with no added artifacts or loss of detail despite the dramatic neon lighting around them. This indicates a successful application of style without compromising the visual integrity of these objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the placements of neon lighting effects around the mirror and sink area preserve visual plausibility, ensuring physical rationality and absence of distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon lighting effect seems to have been implemented strategically, following the contours of the mirror and sink area. The lighting effect appears physically plausible, as it integrates seamlessly with the layout and design of the bathroom. There is no visible distortion or misplacement that would detract from the realism of the neon effect.",
