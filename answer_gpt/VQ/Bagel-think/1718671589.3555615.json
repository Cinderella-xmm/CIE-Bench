      "question": "Do the biscuit panels on the building walls exhibit uniform texture and color without visible cracks, patches, or unnatural grain patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the biscuit panels on the building walls appear to have a consistent texture and coloration. The panels are constructed to resemble baked gingerbread and show no signs of cracking, patches, or unnatural grain patterns. This uniformity suggests careful craftsmanship aimed at achieving a realistic and aesthetically pleasing representation. If there were any visible imperfections or inconsistencies, they would detract from the visual appeal of the gingerbread construction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sugar-glazed dome smoothly curved with consistent color and reflective properties, and does it align correctly with the base structure without appearing warped or misproportioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dome in Image B presents a smooth, curved surface consistent with what one would expect from a sugar-glazed gingerbread figure. It maintains an even color and reflects light uniformly across its surface, signifying a realistic glaze application. Furthermore, its alignment with the base structure is accurate, showing no signs of distortion or misproportion, which is crucial for maintaining the architectural integrity of the gingerbread building.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the icing patterns on the windows and doors clearly defined, evenly applied, and positioned within the frame boundaries without overlapping or deforming the original window/door shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the icing patterns decorating the windows and doors are well-defined and appear to be evenly applied. These patterns are positioned accurately within the boundaries of each window and door frame. There is no overlap or deformation visible, which ensures the neatness and clarity expected in gingerbread art, enhancing the overall design consistency and aesthetic appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the tree trunks and branches maintain natural branching patterns, and are the sugar-coated leaves evenly distributed without clumping or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are created with a stylized design that aims to mimic natural branching patterns, as seen in gingerbread art. The sugar-coated leaves are arranged evenly and symmetrically across the branches, avoiding clumping or unrealistic floating effects, providing a harmonious balance and reinforcing the gingerbread theme's aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the marble slab extend continuously under the building and surrounding area, with consistent lighting and reflection, and no visible gaps or distortions at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marble slab in Image B extends uniformly beneath the gingerbread building and surrounding elements. It shows consistent lighting and reflective properties, typical of a polished marble surface. There are no visible gaps or distortions at the edges, supporting a continuous and seamless base that enhances the building's presentation and structural cohesiveness in the gingerbread model.",
