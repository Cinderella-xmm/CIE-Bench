    "Question": "Q1: Are the gullwing doors reshaped into raised, rounded button-like structures symmetrically placed on both sides of the car, with smooth transitions from the body and no visible warping or clipping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gullwing doors are open, resembling typical gullwing configuration in a car. They do not exhibit raised, rounded button-like structures. The doors maintain their functional and characteristic shape, and there is no indication of a redesign into buttons. Comparing this with Image A, we see the doors maintaining their conventional design without any transformation into button-like elements.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the front grille redesigned into a four-segment cross-shaped directional pad with evenly spaced and aligned sections, centered beneath the Mercedes emblem, and free from overlapping or missing segments?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the front grille featuring traditional car design elements. It does not appear to have been redesigned into a four-segment cross-shaped directional pad. The grill retains its original segmented appearance, consistent with its conventional design, with no presence of structure akin to a directional pad. In Image A, the grill has the classic horizontal crease of a Mercedes vehicle, without any transformation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the entire exterior surface exhibit consistent metallic red coloring with smooth gloss highlights that follow the curvature of the body and reflect ambient light realistically without abrupt transitions or flat areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the car's surface has a more illustrated appearance rather than realistic metallic texture, lacking individual gloss highlights that would realistically follow the body's curvature. The reflection and coloration are uniform without realistic reflectiveness typical of metallic skin, and differ from Image A, which displays a true car finish with metallic sheen and realistic light interaction.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a detailed emblem located on the dashboard area, resembling a central control button, with clear lines and shading that match the surrounding interior materials and do not appear displaced or blurry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, no distinct dashboard area is visible due to the perspective shown, and no image detail of an emblem resembling a central button is perceived. The area lacks any detailed interior visible from the angle, instead maintaining a simplified reflective design. Image A also does not prominently showcase the dashboard details from this perspective, emphasizing external elements instead.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is a branded logo placed centrally on the hood, shaped like a circular control element with defined edges and consistent depth, and aligned with the carâ€™s longitudinal axis without tilting or stretching?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Mercedes logo on the hood takes a distinctive size and style, with a less defined edge in comparison to realistic logos. It does not appear circular nor like a control element, just remaining as part of the car's branding and design. In Image A, the logo generally appears centrally aligned, but not transformed into a control-like design element as described.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all edited components (shoulder buttons, D-pad grille, hood logo) fully attached to the car body with no floating parts, misaligned joints, or unnatural bends in the structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, no edited components such as shoulder buttons or a D-pad grille are observed. The hood logo is integrated into the design but not singularly defined as described. Thus, there are no detached or floating elements visible here. In Image A, the components of the car maintain their conventional placement and integration, without floating elements or distortions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, repeated patterns, or unnatural reflections at the boundaries of edited regions (e.g., door edges, grille perimeter, hood logo)?",
    "explanation": "Image B does have a stylized artistic rendering, without realistic detail or evidence of jagged lines along the vehicle edges, though it does have uniform stylized coloring and reflection geometry. The drawing style results in smooth overall appearance without visual artifacting. In Image A, natural realism governs the depiction with authentic lighting but no edited observables or artifacts.",
    "answer": "No"
