      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the character's body maintain the natural texture and shape of a hot dog without any visible artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's body is designed to appear as a hot dog bun. However, closer inspection reveals that while the shape somewhat resembles a hot dog, the texture does not match the typical smooth and elongated form of a hot dog; instead, it has a smooth humanoid form without the same realistic features. The absence of a genuine food texture indicates a deviation from a hot dog's natural appearance, thus suggesting artifacts or distortions in achieving the depiction.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's hair is crafted to look like coleslaw, featuring the similar cream-like base and colorful shredded strands. The strands maintain a relatively consistent appearance, capturing the essential visual elements of coleslaw. Despite the stylized presentation, there are no obvious clumps or distortions evident in the hair's appearance that would contradict the normal texture of coleslaw.",
