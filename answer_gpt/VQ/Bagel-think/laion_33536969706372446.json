    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the deep burgundy drapes hang naturally with smooth folds and consistent shadow gradients, and do they cast realistic shadows on the wall and floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The deep burgundy drapes exhibit neatly arranged folds that follow the natural path of fabric draping due to gravity. The shadows seem to emanate evenly from these folds, presenting gradual transitions that are consistent with what would be expected from a real-world scenario where fabric casts shadows via a soft lighting source. These shadows follow the walls and floor as anticipated. The fluidity in their representation suggests a realistic shadow effect.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gold woodwork details on the bed frame continuous, symmetrical, and free from warped or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold woodwork features intricate design elements like ornate corners and symmetrical patterning, which usually denote a well-crafted piece. Studying the visual cues, they appear coherent with each section exhibiting uniformity and symmetry. There is no apparent distortion in angles or the dynamic shapes, indicating continuity and precision in design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cherub images on the pillows show visible brushstroke texture, subtle color gradients, and seamless integration into the pillow surface without sharp borders or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the pillows, the cherub images showcase integration with varying shades and smooth transitions in hue and tone. This indicates skillful blending with the textile surface, likely achieved through painting techniques that do not disrupt visual aesthetics. The absence of pixelation or abrupt edges confirms a seamless approach is taken in image incorporation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the new canopy drapes and gold woodwork match the direction of the ceiling light and fall consistently on adjacent walls and floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By evaluating the light source positioned overhead and its emanating direction, shadows from the canopy drapes and gold woodwork align with expected paths: downward and slightly outward. They expand logically across nearby surfaces, corresponding with the illumination angle. This consistency verifies realism in shadow portrayal with respect to light direction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the redesigned canopy bed fully contained within the room boundaries, with no parts extending beyond the ceiling or overlapping the wall, and does it maintain a realistic scale relative to the nightstand and rug?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scrutiny of spatial arrangement shows the canopy bed fits comfortably beneath the ceiling, not encroaching on wall space, and maintains a size harmony alongside nearby elements like the nightstand and rug. The proportional relations suggest that the bed's placement sustains room integrity and manages spatial awareness with elegance.",
