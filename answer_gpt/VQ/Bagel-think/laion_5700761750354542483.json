    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the embroidered patterns on the butterfly’s wings and body aligned with the original gemstone positions and do they display consistent thread density and color without visible breaks or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly features embroidered patterns on its wings. The patterns are composed of blue dots on a beige background, representing a design choice rather than exact alignment with gemstone positions seen in Image A. There is consistency in the density and color of threads with no apparent breaks or misalignments. Comparing to Image A, which features complex gemstone arrangements, Image B focuses on simpler patterned designs without aligning to the original gemstone placements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the butterfly’s body and frame appear made of soft fabric with no visible metallic shine or rigid edges, and does it show natural fabric folds or drape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly appears crafted from soft fabric, notably distinguished by its velvety texture and lack of metallic shine or rigid edges. The design allows for natural fabric folds, which is a departure from the metallic and gemstone-studded body seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wing surfaces exhibit a uniform, matte, soft-textured appearance consistent with velvet, with no shiny spots or reflections resembling gemstones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the butterfly wings crafted from a material with a uniform, matte, soft-textured appearance, akin to velvet. There are no shiny spots or reflections that resemble gemstones, which contrasts with Image A, where the wings are embellished with shiny gemstones.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the fluffy trim along the wing edges evenly distributed, soft, and attached in a way that follows the wing’s natural curve without appearing detached or uneven?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly does not feature any fluffy trim along the wing edges, hence the question cannot be addressed by evaluating the presence, distribution, or attachment of such trim. Image A similarly does not feature trim, focusing instead on gemstone embellishments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the butterfly’s wings symmetrically shaped, the body proportionate to the wings, and the antennae correctly positioned and curved, with no visible warping or scaling errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly displays symmetry in wing shape, proportionality between the body and wings, and correctly positioned antennae. There is no evidence of warping or scaling errors, consistent with a crafted design. This echoes the design principles seen in Image A, which also maintains symmetry and proportionality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the butterfly resting on a smooth, uniformly pearl-white cushion with a natural shadow underneath, indicating proper contact and physical grounding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly rests on a smooth, uniformly pearl-white cushion, and there is a natural shadow underneath that suggests proper contact and physical grounding. Image A shows the butterfly on a tree branch instead, representing different contextual placement but not directly affecting the comparison of grounding and shadow presence in Image B.",
