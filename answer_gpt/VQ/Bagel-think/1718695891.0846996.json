      "question": "Are the fabric folds of the woman's dress clearly defined and consistent with natural draping behavior, without unnatural smoothing or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the fabric folds on the woman's dress appears stylized and simplified, consistent with an illustrative form rather than a realistic photograph. Cartoons or illustrations often simplify details like fabric folds into clean lines or block colors, which is visible here. Hence, the natural draping behavior is not captured in terms of texture but is consistent in style with smooth, clear outlines. This approach aligns with the illustrative nature of the art. Such representation does not typically present unnatural smoothing or pixelation given the illustrative style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the floral and curvilinear motifs in the background remain continuous and symmetrical, with no visible breaks or misalignments in the decorative framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the floral and curvilinear motifs as continuous and symmetrical around the central figure. The illustration ensures this through consistent use of lines and patterns. These motifs are depicted in a stylized manner, where curves and lines are intentionally designed to flow organically and harmoniously, without the risk of misalignment common in more detailed or textured artworks.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold trim along the perimeter of the image evenly applied, with consistent thickness and reflective properties that match the surrounding lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold trim in Image B is drawn with a uniform thickness around the perimeter, consistent with the illustration's style. The trim does not exhibit reflective properties because that level of detail is not typical in this type of artwork; reflections are usually implied through color and shading in more realistic images rather than flat illustrations. Thus, the consistency is about maintaining uniform lines and color rather than reflecting light as expected in realistic images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the woman’s right hand maintain a natural position with five fingers properly aligned and no deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the illustration of Image B, details such as fingers on the woman’s right hand are simplified as part of the art style. The hand is positioned and drawn in a natural way, and while specific features like finger alignment are less detailed, it remains without deformation or extra digits. This simplification fits the illustrative choice and harmony within the art style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors throughout the image uniformly balanced, with no sudden transitions or patches of unnatural saturation that suggest layering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B are uniformly balanced with consistent saturation throughout the image. The illustration employs a cohesive color palette typical of this style, where flat applications of color are often used to maintain harmony and visual flow. There are no abrupt transitions or jarring patches observed, as such issues can be common in layered digital editing but are avoided with careful illustrative design.",
