      "question": "Does the isometric representation of the figurine box maintain consistent angles and edges without distorted or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box containing the figurine displays proper isometric characteristics, with angles and edges appearing consistent. The lines and corners are meticulously defined and follow a geometric pattern reflecting what would be expected from an accurately designed box. Such consistency indicates the geometry of the box is intact and purposeful rather than distorted or arbitrarily broken. This judgment is based on observing the clear alignment of the box's structural elements, adhering to concepts of design and perspective.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral-themed accents on the figurine box proportionally sized and textured in a way that matches the material and style of the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral-themed accents on the figurine box in Image B are detailed with an artistic style that corresponds harmoniously with the decorative aesthetics of the box. These accents appear proportionate relative to the box's size, and their texture is consistent with a printed or painted decoration that would typically be found on such packaging. Observations of delicately detailed flower designs reveal the artist’s approach to maintaining proportional harmony within the design's framework and material presentation.",

      "question": "Is the chibi cat figure positioned correctly within the box, with its body fully contained and aligned with the interior space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the chibi cat figure is positioned precisely within the box, with its form entirely contained inside the interior space without protrusions beyond the box's alignment. This accurate positioning suggests a thoughtful design that ensures the figure fits appropriately within its designated space. The common logic applied here involves checking if elements are confined within physical boundaries and ensures they occupy the intended spatial positioning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the eyes of the chibi cat exhibit smooth, uniform glass-like reflection without visible pixelation or irregular highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi cat in Image B has eyes that showcase a smooth surface with a uniform, glass-like reflection, lacking any evident pixelation or irregularities in the highlights. This smoothness and clarity in reflection are characteristic of high-quality rendering and realistic portrayal of glossy surfaces, aiming for a visual appeal that is free from distracting flaws. Assessment involved inspecting for gradation consistency and reflective elegance reminiscent of glass or polished surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the fur texture of the realistic cat figure beside the box show consistent flow and detail comparable to the original cat’s fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the realistic cat figure in Image B, its fur texture shows an artistic style distinct from that of Image A, with more emphasis on simplified illustration rather than detailed realistic portrayal. The fur in Image A exhibits high realism and intricacy, whereas Image B's chibi cat emulates a stylized texture suitable for collectibles, rather than replicating realism. This evaluation contrasts the complexity and detail levels, highlighting differences in visual representation aligning with different design intentions.",
