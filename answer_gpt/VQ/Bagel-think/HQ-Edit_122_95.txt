    "Question": "Q1: Does the mosaic pattern on the saree maintain uniform tesserae size and alignment across the fabric, with no visible seams or distorted tiles?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the saree with a decorative mosaic pattern featuring blues and whites over the original red and gold embroidery. There is variation in tesserae size and alignment, with some appearing irregular, which disrupts a uniform appearance. The patches of the mosaic seem randomly placed, leading to distorted tiles instead of consistent uniformity.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the arches and dome of the transformed building structurally coherent, with straight edges, consistent curvature, and no broken or misaligned geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the building resembles the Taj Mahal, the geometrical structure deviates with patterns that do not follow coherent architectural design. The arches and dome show exaggerated decorative patterns, leading to visually misaligned geometry that affects the typical structural coherence observed in classical architecture.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the floral motifs evenly distributed and proportionally sized relative to the surrounding architecture, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while incorporating enhanced visual elements, the floral motifs on the saree appear crowded and disproportionately enhanced, occasionally overlapping incorrectly with no consistency in relation to the background architecture. These ornamental alterations indicate flawed distribution and sizing relative to surrounding elements.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the golden backdrop exhibit smooth gradient transitions and subtle surface variations, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural shine?",
    "explanation": "The golden backdrop in Image B is significantly altered with prominent color shifts and added shine. The altered colors present abrupt transitions and appear unnatural due to the excessive patterns introduced, disrupting the smoother gradient that would be typical of a more natural scene.",
    "answer": "No"
