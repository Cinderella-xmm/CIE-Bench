      "question": "Does the schematic outline of the wallet maintain accurate proportions and closed geometric shapes without jagged edges or missing lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the schematic outline of the wallet is represented by simple geometric lines which define its shape. These lines visually appear straight and closed without any jagged edges or missing sections, maintaining the structure of a wallet shape accurately. Hence, based on the visual cues, the wallet in Image B is proportioned correctly as per the provided outline.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lines forming the wallet’s schematic structure uniformly thin, continuous, and free of smudges or inconsistent thickness that suggest texture or artifact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the wallet's schematic structure using lines that are intended to outline the shape without adding texture. The lines are thin and have consistent thickness throughout the structure, devoid of smudges or artifact-like inconsistencies, maintaining visual clarity in representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the text annotations for “USD,” “QAR,” and “INR” placed adjacent to their respective banknote slots without overlapping the notes or distorting the wallet’s layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the annotations 'USD,' 'QAR,' and 'INR' seem to be missing or have been replaced by unrelated symbols and text. This results in a layout where the specific annotations relating to currency are not visibly next to the banknote slots, and the placement does not reference any wallet layout or alignment.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the exchange rate charts and country economy icons aligned horizontally or vertically in a balanced manner, with no floating or misplaced elements that disrupt visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a design where various icons and text are meant to represent some kind of chart or design. However, the arrangement appears cluttered with symbols and images that don’t align in a typical chart arrangement. This misalignment and clutter result in a lack of visual balance and flow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the visible banknotes (USD $20, QAR 10, INR 50) retain clear denominations, readable text, and intact designs without blurring, stretching, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual representation in Image B, there are illustrations that imitate some form of design or notes. However, these do not retain any clear text, denominations, or designs typical of actual banknotes, with fonts and designs that lack clarity and accuracy compared to real currency.",
