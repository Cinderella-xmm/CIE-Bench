      "question": "Does the truck maintain its original proportions and structural integrity without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck appears as a cartoon or illustrated version with simplified shapes and lines. Despite the stylistic changes, the truck's proportions are still consistent with a standard truck's structure. The cab, wheels, exhaust pipes, and grille exhibit logical proportions relative to each other. Such abstraction is common in cartoon illustrations where straight lines and non-distorted geometric shapes represent objects more simplistically but accurately in terms of size and relation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces and textures of the truck, such as the wheels, cab, and grille, free from unnatural artifacts and retain appropriate levels of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B modifies the truck's detailed realism to an illustrative, cartoon-like representation. In this style, textures are replaced by solid colors and simplified outlines. Although lacking photorealistic details, this transformation is intentional for artistic coherence. Hence, while there are no textures akin to reality, the design avoids odd artifacts or inconsistent lines. Simplified detail level is typical for such representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cab's vibrant colors appear natural against the truck's materials and lighting conditions, ensuring material consistency and avoiding unrealistic contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs vibrant colors typical in cartoon illustrations. The red of the cab and other components are solid without shading, expected in non-realistic portrayals. The colors appear vibrant yet harmonize within this style context, where consistency in application overrules natural material appearance. Such vibrant use aligns with the intention of creating visually appealing, stylistic simplicity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the simplified background naturally integrated with the truck, maintaining the overall authenticity of the scene without introducing distracting or out-of-place elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is simplified, using flat colors typical in cartoon-style art. It forms a coherent setting behind the truck that enhances rather than distracts from the central illustration. While losing realistic texture, the background remains visually integrated, creating an authentic scene fit within its artistic intent. The use of solid colors and simple shapes supports the primary focus on the truck.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wheels maintain their structural and physical logic, with no signs of distortion or misalignment, thereby preserving the truck's visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the truck wheels in a stylized manner conducive to cartoon art. Their circular forms, though simplified, align logically with the truck's overall structure. The absence of distortion or misalignment retains the representation's coherence, typical when simplifying components in such art. Consistent with cartoon conventions, while lacking detailed realism, they preserve the truck's visual credibility.",
