      "question": "Is the entire cityscape and car enclosed within a transparent, geometrically perfect cube with consistent refractive qualities that distort surrounding elements naturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment containing the car and cityscape is visually enclosed by what appears to be a transparent cube. The lines of the cube are geometrically straight and proportional, showing a naturally consistent cube shape. The cube's refractive qualities can be inferred from the subtle optical distortions around its edges, which are consistent with how a perfectly shaped glass cube would appear. Through world knowledge of how glass cubes function, it's evident the cube maintains an even appearance without distorting the elements inside in an unnatural manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car's surface exhibit a uniform, high-quality metallic texture with natural reflections and no artifacts like blotches, smudges, or missing specular highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car features a highly polished, metallic surface with smooth gradients and reflections typical of a high-quality, reflective material. There are no visible artifacts such as blotches or smudges, and the specular highlights appear natural and consistent with the car's curves and contours. This indicates a careful rendering process that preserves the car's aesthetic integrity in a 3D model or miniature setup.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers scaled down uniformly and proportionally without geometric distortions such as stretched windows, skewed angles, or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the skyscrapers are visibly contained within the boundaries of the transparent cube and appear appropriately scaled down relative to the car. Their structures, including windows and angles, appear proportionally consistent and devoid of any skew, stretching, or broken features. This suggests careful attention to scaling in the creation or rendering of these elements as miniatures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the windows of the skyscrapers display small, consistent, and physically plausible light points resembling micro LEDs without haloing, bleeding, or unnatural brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows of the skyscrapers do not display distinct, small light points. Instead, they maintain a consistent appearance without visible light activities that resemble micro LEDs or any other specific illumination sources. There is no evidence of haloing or bleeding, which could suggest an omission of fine detail rather than an intentional depiction of lighting.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the trees feature finely detailed, dense green foliage with natural color variation and no pixelation or blocky rendering, indicating proper micro-scale modeling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the trees enclosed within the transparent cube exhibit dense green foliage with fine details visible even at the micro scale, which implies careful attention to rendering detail. The color variation appears natural, and there is no noticeable pixelation or blocky rendering. This suggests precise modeling to maintain the tree's realism within a scaled-down environment.",
