      "question": "Does the plush pigeon have a rounded, soft-bodied shape with no visible distortion in limbs or head, and does it maintain a natural posture consistent with a seated stuffed animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush pigeon appears rounded and soft-bodied, typical of a plush toy. The limbs and head don't show any visible distortions, and its posture is consistent with a stuffed animal seated on a surface. The pigeon is positioned as if resting, which matches the expected positioning of a plush item of this nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blue and gray areas on the plush pigeonâ€™s body evenly colored with soft transitions, and do the feather-like patterns appear as continuous, low-relief designs on fabric rather than sharp, digital lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plush pigeon in Image B has evenly colored blue and gray areas that exhibit soft transitions typical of fabric. The feather-like patterns are more akin to low-relief designs stitched or printed onto the fabric, rather than appearing as sharp lines usually found in digital illustrations, confirming the analysis of a fabric representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the architectural elements (columns, arch, distant buildings) display a uniform, matte surface with visible embossed details that resemble cookie dough or icing, and do they lack shiny reflections or metallic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural elements, including columns, arches, and other structures, have a matte surface appearance without any reflective or metallic qualities. The details in these structures appear to be embossed, similar to the texture of cookie dough or icing, rather than resembling traditional building materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a wooden shelf beneath the plush pigeon that is flat, horizontally aligned, and has visible wood grain and natural edge wear, with a shadow extending downward and to the right consistent with the sky light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wooden shelf below the plush pigeon, which is flat and horizontally positioned. The texture indicates visible wood grain, and the edges show signs of natural wear. Furthermore, the shadow extends downward and to the right, consistent with a light source from the sky, aligning with the expected direction given the overall lighting apparent in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all elements in the image (plush pigeon, shelf, cookie structures) share the same lighting direction and shadow behavior, with no overlapping shadows or missing occlusions that suggest inconsistent depth or positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadow directions across all elements, including the plush pigeon, the shelf, and the cookie house structures, are consistent. The shadows fall in a coherent manner with no overlapping or misplaced shadows, maintaining uniform depth and positioning, suggesting all elements are coherently arranged under the same lighting conditions.",
