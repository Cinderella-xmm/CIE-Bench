      "question": "Does the 3D chibi version of the person in the foreground maintain the structural integrity of the suit and cup without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi version of the person in the foreground appears well-constructed. The suit jacket and tie contain enough detail to suggest typical business attire despite the chibi styling, which inherently involves simplified and exaggerated features. The cup is proportionate and recognizable with no obvious distortions. This suggests that the structural integrity is preserved without any unnatural textures.",

      "question": "Does the 3D chibi version of the person in the background retain the natural appearance of the suit and the warm glow of the lamp without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person in the background is quite simplistic due to the chibi style. However, the suit is rendered with adequate detail to maintain its natural appearance. The lamp emits a warm glow consistent with the natural look seen in its real-life counterpart, preserving the ambiance without visible artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features and suit details of both chibi characters rendered with sufficient detail and texture to avoid looking unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases chibi characters which naturally have exaggerated and simplified features, reducing the need for intricate detailing. The suits and overall appearance manage to retain enough detail that aligns with this style, without looking unnatural. Given chibi art's typical design, the minimal details suit the aesthetic.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the hands of the chibi characters, especially the one holding the cup, appear proportionate and physically plausible without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the chibi figures are slightly exaggerated but still functional within the chibi art style context. The hand holding the cup appears capable of naturally gripping it, suggesting that the proportion and physical plausibility are maintained without noticeable distortion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the addition of the photo frame around the chibi-style 3D scene enhance the visual credibility and realism of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The photo frame in Image B provides a contextual boundary that enhances the presentation of the 3D scene, making it appear as an intentional styled artwork. This framing adds to the composition's realism by aligning with how such scenes might be exhibited for stylistic or artistic effect.",
