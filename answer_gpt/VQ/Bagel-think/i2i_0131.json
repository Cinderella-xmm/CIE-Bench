      "question": "Do the refrigerator doors and handles appear proportionally correct and geometrically consistent with typical refrigerator designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a single refrigerator with a set of two doors and symmetrical handles. The proportions of the doors relative to each other within a single refrigerator unit remain consistent with standard side-by-side refrigerator designs, where each door typically mirrors the other in size and shape. The handles are vertical, long, and slim, which is common practice for such kitchen appliances for ergonomic ease and aesthetic appeal. Without comparing to Image A, the design elements appear coherent and realistic according to typical refrigerator standards.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the metallic surfaces of the refrigerator free from unnatural textures, maintaining a consistent and authentic finish throughout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the refrigerator's metallic surface exhibits a uniform finish that reflects light consistently similar to stainless steel appliances commonly found in modern kitchens. There are no visible irregularities or distortions in texture that would suggest manipulation or unnatural alteration. By relying on visual cues, the surface appears smooth and evenly finished, maintaining fidelity to genuine metallic appearances without needing direct comparison to Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the lighting appear uniform across both refrigerators, without noticeable shadows or highlights that disrupt the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a single refrigerator, not two, and the lighting across the singular unit appears evenly distributed without causing distracting shadows or harsh highlights that would distort perception. The lighting seems to enhance the metallic finish by providing natural definition and depth, aligned with how typical kitchen lighting interacts with such surfaces. There is no other refrigerator in Image B to compare uniform lighting across separate units; hence, the evaluation is based solely on the single appliance visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there smooth transitions where the refrigerators meet the cabinets, without visible seams or edges that break the visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the refrigerator integrates seamlessly into the cabinetry space with no visible gaps or edges that would suggest poor alignment or disruption in design symmetry. The cabinetry and appliance fit neatly against each other, suggesting a custom-designed kitchen layout consistent with modern appliance integration techniques that prioritize visual and functional cohesion. The analysis is based on the provided image, reflecting a harmonious arrangement between the cabinetry and the refrigerator.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the water dispensers on both refrigerators clearly defined and positioned appropriately, contributing to the overall realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a single refrigerator with one well-defined water dispenser. The position of the dispenser is on the left door, situated at a height that is realistic for ease of access above the midpoint of the door panel. Its design elements—such as user interface display and dispenser opening—appear comprehensively detailed, maintaining realism in appliance features. As there is only one refrigerator visible in Image B, the evaluation strictly pertains to that unit without direct reference to Image A.",
