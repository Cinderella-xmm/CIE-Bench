      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the keys preserved without distortion after being converted into 3D cartoon-style chibi renditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keys have been transformed into a 3D cartoon-style chibi rendition. Despite this stylization, the essential geometric shapes, like circles, triangles, and rectangles, have been preserved. These elements are crucial for recognizing each key's unique design. The chibi style enhances the features but keeps the geometric integrity intact compared to their more realistic renditions in Image A.",

      "question": "Do the red and gold hues used on the keys appear natural and consistent with the Chinese festive theme without introducing unnatural color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red and gold hues in Image B are typically associated with Chinese festivals, symbolizing good luck and prosperity. The colors are applied uniformly to the keys, providing a cohesive look without any unusual patches or breaks in color. This consistency ensures that the colors align with traditional festive aesthetics, maintaining a natural appearance throughout.",

      "question": "Does the texture of the keys resemble polished, ornamental accessories without introducing unnatural artifacts or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the keys with a smooth, polished texture that aligns with the style of ornamental accessories. Details are present in the form of defined edges and clear design symbols on each key. This polished, decorative style is fitting for cartoon adaptations and doesn't introduce any unnatural artifacts or significant loss of detail compared to Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the \"囍\" paper-cut design in the background complement the keys without disrupting the visual credibility or introducing distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The '囍' design is a traditional Chinese symbol representing double happiness and is commonly used in wedding decor. In Image B, it is subtly integrated into the background and complements the keys' red and gold color scheme. The design doesn't overwhelm or distract from the keys, thus maintaining visual coherence and credibility within the thematic context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions and sizes of the keys in the 3D cartoon-style chibi rendition realistic and coherent, avoiding any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B adopts a chibi style, which typically involves exaggerated proportions, the keys maintain a sense of balance and coherence. The sizes relative to each other are consistent, similar to Image A, preventing unrealistic stretching or compressing of any key. This ensures that each key's character and symbolic representation are preserved, making the proportions appear intentional and purposeful.",
