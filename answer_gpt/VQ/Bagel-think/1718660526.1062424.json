    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the body of the animal consist of small, uniformly sized glossy ceramic tiles arranged in a consistent pattern that follows the contours of the original form without gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the animal in Image B is composed of glossy ceramic tiles. Upon examining the arrangement, the tiles appear to be uniformly sized and are aligned to follow the contour of the animal's body without gaps or misalignment, consistent with the expected precision in mosaic art. The visual cues show a consistent pattern across the body shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes composed of precisely shaped tiles forming distinct white sclera and black pupils, maintaining their original size and position relative to the snout and head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows eyes made from tiles, with clearly defined white sclera and black pupils. The tile arrangement allows the eyes to maintain their original size and position as seen on the body. The circular shape and visual consistency match common mosaic representations of facial features, keeping them proportional to the snout and head.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the stripes across the body maintain uniform width and spacing, with clear transitions between vibrant orange and deep black tiles that match the original pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vivid orange and black tiled stripes are uniform in width and spaced consistently across the animal's body. These transitions between colors are clear and reproduce the stripe pattern seen in Image A. This suggests a deliberate effort to replicate the original pattern with precision.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the surface beneath the animal a textured sandy platform with visible granular detail and subtle moisture variation, providing a tactile contrast to the smooth mosaic tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface in Image B appears to be sandy with visible granular details. There is a contrast between the rough texture and the smooth mosaic tiles on the animal. However, the image doesn't clearly depict subtle moisture variation, which would suggest changes in texture. The knowledge of sand's characteristics allows recognition of this platform.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the limbs and joints of the animal smoothly contoured with no jagged edges, distorted shapes, or missing tiles that would suggest structural inconsistency or rendering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The limbs and joints on the animal in Image B are contoured smoothly without jagged edges or distorted shapes. The tiles are consistently placed, with no missing pieces, representing a well-rendered mosaic. The visual cues of even tile placement suggest structural integrity and precision.",
