    "Question": "Q1: Does the transition from the ceiling fan to the snow globe maintain structural coherence without any visible distortion or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling fan is seamlessly integrated into the snow globe, maintaining its structural integrity and smooth metallic surface. The fan appears proportionally accurate and fits naturally within the snow globe's confines without any visible warping or mismatched textures that would indicate a poor transition. The transition is coherent as there are no indications of distortion where the fan connects to the snow globe. This implies the edit was done with attention to maintaining structural realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the fine details of the fan preserved within the snow globe's interior, avoiding any loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "The fan inside the snow globe in Image B retains intricate details such as the metallic finish, the separation of blades, and the central hub's design, similar to what is observed in Image A. There is no noticeable loss of detail or the addition of unnatural textures, which suggests that the edit preserved the fan's characteristics well while placing it within a new context. Thus, all fine details are preserved accurately.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Does the exterior setting with soft lighting and a warm background complement the snow globe scene naturally, enhancing the overall realism and natural appearance?",
    "explanation": "The background and lighting in Image B create a warm atmosphere that complements the snow globe. There are soft shadows and subtle highlights that imply a realistic light interaction with the glass surface of the globe. The warm tones of the background, along with the snow globe's wooden base, harmonize well, creating a scene that feels natural and realistic, enhancing the overall visual appeal of the snow globe edit.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the proportions of the snow globe and its contents physically plausible, with no distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe and its contents, including the fan, small house, and trees, are proportionally accurate. The fan fits naturally inside the snow globe and maintains its geometric integrity without distortion. The house and trees are sized appropriately relative to each other, creating a coherent scene. There are no signs of broken shapes or awkward scaling that would detract from physical plausibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the light passing through the snow globe create delicate shimmering effects on nearby surfaces that appear authentic and do not disrupt the scene's overall authenticity?",
    "explanation": "The light interaction in Image B, as it passes through the snow globe, creates subtle highlights and reflections. These effects are consistent with how light interacts with glass and snow, adding depth and authenticity without compromising the scene. The light effects do not overpower the scene and fit cohesively into the overall visual composition, thus maintaining the authenticity of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
