    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the golden wand have smooth, reflective surfaces with consistent lighting and shadows that match the surrounding environment, and is it properly connected to the reel and the fisherman’s hand without gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wand is depicted as having a golden surface that reflects light. The wand is not smoothly connected to the reel or the fisherman’s hand, which suggests that it's an addition, possibly edited into the scene. This is indicated by any inconsistencies in the connection between the wand and the hand or reel. Upon analysis, any visible gaps or distortions would clarify issues with the integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the hat and plaid shirt visibly enhanced but still consistent with real fabric appearance, with no pixelation, stretching, or broken patterns in the weave or seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible textures on the hat and plaid shirt in Image B should show realistic fabric patterns that align with real-world textures. When examining the details, such as pixelation or distortion, any issues would be evident in areas where the fabric looks unnatural or digitally altered. The image clearly maintains a high level of detail, suggesting consistency with real fabric.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the magical ripples originate from the tip of the wand and spread outward in continuous, concentric patterns that interact naturally with the water surface and reflections, without floating or disconnected wave segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, any magical ripples should start from the wand and naturally interact with the lake's water, ensuring seamless transition and continuity in the ripple patterns. If the ripples appear to hover, float, or look disconnected from the physical space or water surface, it would indicate poor editing or unnatural effect integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden frame positioned around the image with correct perspective, consistent texture, and shadows that align with the scene’s lighting, and do the embossed pine tree details appear three-dimensional without distortion or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a wooden frame that seems to line the picture perfectly, following the perspective of the image and aligning with the natural shadows cast within the scene. The embossing of pine trees on the frame, if three-dimensional and distortion-free, indicates a high-quality integration. Examination shows that shadows and details match the scene's lighting, supporting accurate frame presentation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the fisherman’s hands show five fingers each with natural joint positioning and skin texture, and is his facial structure preserved without distortion in both the original and reflected image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fisherman’s hands should anatomically consist of five fingers each, depicted with natural joint articulation and realistic skin texture. Any abnormality in finger count, proportion, or texture can suggest editing oversights. The analysis should confirm that reflectivity maintains body symmetry except for the blurred identity aspect, and visible parts should maintain realistic construction.",
