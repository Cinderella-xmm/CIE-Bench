    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the table appear transformed into a tea box lid with consistent geometry and engraved leaf patterns that follow natural contours without warping or breaking the surface structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the table is absent, replaced by a tea box lid that features a carved outline resembling foliage. The geometry of the lid is consistent without visible warping, and the engraved patterns follow natural contours. The exploration of leaf shapes aligns well with realistic designs, creating a harmonious blend that does not distort or break the surface structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the replaced cups depicted with clear, detailed sustainable material textures (such as fibrous or layered patterns) that appear natural and integrated into the scene without visible artifacts or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks individual cups and instead features a teapot lid with earthy textures adorned with a leaf pattern. There is intricate detailing that suggests continuity with sustainable materials but does not directly include visible cups in the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tag with the text \"Zen Autumn Tea\" clearly legible, stylistically consistent with the scene’s aesthetic, and seamlessly integrated with proper lighting and shadow alignment to avoid appearing pasted on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Riul Comgrønhe' is displayed on the lid, not 'Zen Autumn Tea'. The integration of this tag reflects a stylistic consistency with the design aesthetics, providing thematic continuity with suitable lighting and shadow effects. However, it does not fit the 'Zen Autumn Tea' specification as requested.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the teapot reshaped into a leaf contour with smooth, continuous edges and natural-looking earthy textures that do not show distortion, clipping, or unnatural color gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a teapot within a leaf-shaped cutout symbolizing a narrative of nature integration, marked by earthy textures and smooth contours. The design reflects continuous edges without visible distortion or unnatural gradients, adhering well to a realistic and harmonious presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all edited elements (tea box lid, sustainable cups, brand tag, leaf-shaped teapot) align with the original lighting direction and cast consistent shadows, maintaining spatial harmony and depth without floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collective elements, such as the tea lid and leaf-shaped teapot design with associated thematic aspects, seem to reflect cohesive lighting direction and shadow casting that’s consistent with the overall layout. Spatial integrity is preserved without indications of floating or misaligned aspects, achieving a natural incorporation within the scene.",
