    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the person retain a natural jumping pose that aligns with typical human biomechanics, avoiding any distortion or unnatural posturing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pose depicted is a stylized artistic rendition of a jumping posture, typically seen in graffiti art, meant to evoke movement and action. While somewhat exaggerated, it still aligns with typical human biomechanics as it suggests motion and balance, which are necessary for such a position.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bold outlines applied to the person and surrounding elements smooth and continuous, without any jagged edges or breaks that would disrupt the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outlines in Image B are typical of hand-drawn or graffiti-style art, characterized by thick, bold, smooth lines. These lines are continuous and help define the character and the surrounding elements without any noticeable breaks, ensuring the visual flow is maintained.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the background blend the graffiti and concrete texture effectively, creating an authentic look without overlapping issues or blending that obscures either element's distinct characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background effectively combines graffiti art with concrete texture, typical of urban environments. The graffiti is well integrated without excessively obscuring the texture of the wall, allowing both elements to coexist and contribute to the overall aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the individual's face been preserved authentically within the new artistic style, retaining identifiable features like the eyes, nose, and mouth without distortion or excessive simplification?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face is not preserved authentically in the new artistic style; it is intentionally blurred, removing identifiable features and simplifying it to a nondescript block.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the details and patterns on the suit, tie, and shirt remain discernible within the hand-drawn style, avoiding any unnatural smudging or loss of defining characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the transition to a hand-drawn style, details such as patterns on the clothing typically undergo simplification or adaptation to match artistic needs. While Image B maintains the general essence of clothing design, details and patterns can be discerned but are adapted to suit the hand-drawn graffiti style.",
