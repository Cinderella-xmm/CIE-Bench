        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's body exhibits a consistent polished wood texture with visible grain patterns that align with the contours of the figure. The texture appears smooth and uniform across the entire body, and there are no visible abrupt transitions or unnatural patches. This visual cue is indicative of skilled wood craftsmanship, as the grain patterns contribute to the aesthetic by complementing the sculpted form of the dog.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial pattern in Image B is clearly defined with distinct wood tones representing the dark and light areas.

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features—such as the eye sockets, nose bridge, and mouth outline—accentuated with fine, realistic carved lines that enhance depth without distorting proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are accentuated with fine carved lines that add depth to the eye sockets, nose bridge, and mouth outline. These details are executed with precision, ensuring the proportions of the face remain intact. The carving adds realism to the wooden sculpture by providing depth and shadowing effects without distorting the overall structure of the face.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that all body parts such as the head, ears, legs, and paws maintain smooth, rounded contours, consistent with the figure's design intentions. There are no flattened areas or sharp edges, which indicates skilled carving and attention to detail. The smoothness of the contours ensures the sculpture maintains a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing form.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is set on a flat, minimalist wooden platform that has a similar material tone and finish as the figure.
