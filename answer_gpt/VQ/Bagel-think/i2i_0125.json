      "question": "Does the area around the apples show any unnatural textures or artifacts after adding the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see text placed above and near the apples. To assess the area around the apples, particularly where the text is near, I inspect if there are any inconsistencies, such as pixelation, changes in texture, or disruptions in the lighting and background consistency that can occur with poorly executed edits. The image appears clean with no noticeable artifacts, ensuring that there are no unnatural textures or disruptions introduced by the addition of text.",

      "question": "Do the fonts for \"Fresh\" and \"Sweet\" appear visually consistent with the background image, avoiding any visual disruption or inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "I evaluate the integration of the text 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' on Image B by examining whether the font style, size, and color harmonize with the overall aesthetic of the image. The white, bold fonts stand out but do not clash due to their simple and clean design that complements the image's setting. The background remains harmonious without any prominent disruptions caused by the text.",

      "question": "Are the shapes of the apples preserved without distortion after incorporating the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, I focus on the shapes and structures of the apples themselves. The text added is situated away from directly overlapping the apples, avoiding any alteration or distortion to their round shapes. Since the text does not interfere spatially with the apples, their natural forms are preserved.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the alignment of the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right properly aligned so that it doesn't alter the apples' structure or visual balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the text in Image B allows for an assessment of how it affects the overall composition. While the text 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' are placed at opposite ends relative to the apples, their placement maintains the image's visual balance. The apples act as the focal point with the text surrounding them, rather than intruding, which preserves the natural structure and visual harmony.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the apples, including their speckles and light reflections, remained clear and undamaged after adding the text “Fresh” and “Sweet”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, a detailed inspection of the apples’ surfaces—looking at speckles and reflections—is conducted to see if they're compromised by the overlay of text. The placement of 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' is away from these detailed areas, allowing the apples’ texture and light reflections to remain intact. This means the fine details are preserved without any detriment from the editing.",
