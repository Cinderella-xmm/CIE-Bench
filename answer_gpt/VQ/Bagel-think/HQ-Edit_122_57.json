      "question": "Does the crystal vase maintain the original shape and proportions of the ceramic vase, with clear faceted surfaces that follow the curvature without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal vase has a rounded shape and a vertically ribbed design, similar to traditional vase forms. The facets are precise and clear, which aligns with typical crystal craftsmanship. However, when compared to Image A, the ceramic vase has a more ornate, detailed design with sculptural elements and painted decorations. The crystal vase's surface does not have these elaborate features, indicating differences in shape and design detail between the two. Therefore, the crystal vase doesn't maintain the same elaborate shape and proportions of the ceramic vase.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the abstract floral patterns on the crystal vase etched into the surface with uniform depth and clarity, without appearing superimposed or blurred?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal vase features crystalline flowers that are part of the composition rather than patterns etched into the vase itself. These flowers do not exhibit any etching into the vase surface. Instead, they are sculpted and attached atop or around the vase. Thus, there aren't abstract floral patterns etched into the vase, but rather sculptural components that constitute the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the crystal flowers retain the recognizable shapes of the original blooms and display internal refraction and pastel coloration without appearing solid or opaque?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal flowers in Image B are designed with clear, faceted surfaces that allow for internal refraction, which is a hallmark of crystal design. These flowers display features such as multiple petals and leaves, which can be recognized as resembling floral shapes. They also have a pastel tint, notably in the pinkish hues seen in some petals, enhancing their translucent appearance. Therefore, they do maintain a degree of recognizable floral shape, refraction, and pastel coloration.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mirrored pedestal flat and reflective, showing a clear, undistorted reflection of the crystal vase and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the crystal structure appears to be a reflective surface, suggesting a mirror. This pedestal shows the reflection of the vase and the attached flowers clearly, without visual distortion. This is consistent with the properties of a flat, mirrored surface that appropriately reflects objects placed upon it without warping their appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting show realistic refraction and internal glow in the crystal elements, with soft highlights and no unnatural bright spots or flat shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B highlights the facets of the crystal elements, emphasizing their transparency and internal glow. The soft highlights on the edges of the crystals indicate a realistic approach to depicting how light interacts with crystal, which refracts and disperses light subtly. There is no presence of flat shading or unnaturally bright spots that would suggest inconsistency in lighting or an unrealistic portrayal.",
