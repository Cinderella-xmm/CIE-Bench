      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the transition between the dog and the banana involves looking for any signs of editing such as seams, unnatural edges, or visual anomalies where these two objects meet. The transition appears to be smooth, and there aren't any obvious visible seams or unnatural edges, indicating a satisfactory edit regarding the blending of objects.",

      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the dog and the banana consistent with each other and the surrounding grass, indicating a natural light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing lighting and shadows involves looking at their direction, intensity, and consistency across the dog, banana, and grass. The lighting seems consistent as all elements in the image receive light from a similar direction and intensity, enhancing the perception of a natural light source present in the scene. The shadows cast appear coherent with each other and the environment.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the connection between the dog and the banana does not show any loss of fine details or unnatural textures. Both objects appear to have retained their individual details, and no disruption in visual quality is noted where they visually connect, confirming a well-executed blend.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B involves considering the expected size relationship between a small dog like a Chihuahua and a banana. The proportions portrayed in the image appear realistic; the banana is appropriately sized compared to the small dog, maintaining a reasonable size contrast without any unnatural distortion, stretching, or shrinking.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's fur and the bananaâ€™s peel retain their characteristic textures and appearances. The dog's fur maintains its typical fine strands and realistic look, while the banana's peel shows its distinctive smooth and spotted texture, aiding in the overall realism of the image despite being edited.",
