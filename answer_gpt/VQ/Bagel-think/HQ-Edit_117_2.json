      "question": "Do the embossed tribal patterns on the ceramic pots maintain consistent texture and depth with the original material, without visible artifacts such as floating lines or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceramic pots and their intricate patterns need to be examined to identify any visible flaws like floating lines or distortions. The tribal patterns should appear naturally embossed with consistent texture and a sense of depth that matches the original material's expectations. Based on the visual inspection, if the patterns seem coherent with the ceramic surface and avoid any anomalies, they are considered consistent. Upon review, the patterns on the pots in Image B are consistent, showing no obvious artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the expanded motifs on the dress proportionally consistent with the garment’s structure, and do they avoid unnatural stretching or breaking of fabric lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the dress motifs in Image B requires checking if they follow the garment's flow without distortions. The motifs should align with the fabric contours naturally, maintaining coherent lines and shapes as seen on clothing. Evaluating the dress in Image B, the motifs are placed proportionately and seamlessly along the garment, showing no signs of stretching or breaking.",

      "question": "Do the transformed bread and cucumber retain recognizable forms as food items while incorporating character features, without unnatural deformations or texture inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed bread and cucumber have been given character features, which should integrate naturally without losing their identities as food items. They need to maintain their familiar shapes and surfaces. Upon inspection, both retain recognizable features akin to bread and cucumber, even with added character elements, and show no unnatural deformities.",

      "question": "Are the boundaries of each postcard vignette cleanly separated from the original image without cutting off elements or introducing edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To assess the postcard vignette boundaries in Image B, it's important that there are no abrupt cut-offs or edge artifacts that might interfere with the cleanliness of the separation. The postcards need to end cleanly at their borders. Image B shows the postcards positioned distinctly with clean boundaries, free from unwanted cut-offs or artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the woman’s right hand (visible near the stove) have five fingers with natural proportions and positioning, and does it cast a shadow consistent with the light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's right hand, seen by the stove, is assessed for anatomical accuracy. This involves checking if five fingers are correctly depicted with natural proportions and if the hand's shadow aligns with the light source direction. Upon closer look, the hand is proportionate and its fingers are naturally positioned, also casting a realistic shadow.",
