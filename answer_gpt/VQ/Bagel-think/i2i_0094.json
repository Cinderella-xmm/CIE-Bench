      "question": "Are the metallic textures added to the camera body natural, maintaining the camera's structural coherence without visible artifacts or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera body is transformed to exhibit a steampunk aesthetic, characterized by metallic textures and components existing in mechanical harmony with the overall design. The structural coherence is preserved as the elements blend well, without visible artifacts or illogical inconsistencies. The addition of gears and metallic detailing augments the steampunk aesthetic fittingly, with no loss of the camera's essential shape and form. The intricate detailing supports this conclusion through visual cues of symmetry and consistency commonly appreciated in such art styles.",

      "question": "Does the lens maintain its original proportions and geometric shape, with metallic textures that appear authentic and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the lens upholds its circular geometry and proportionality while being enveloped in a steampunk metal texture. The authenticity of the appearance is preserved as it exhibits metallic rims and cogs fitting the mechanical theme, straightforward in form without being warped or distorted compared to traditional designs. These visual features align well with the lensâ€™s structure as they are implemented in detail and appropriately throughout its display.",

      "question": "Do the tripod legs and head display metallic textures that are consistent with their original structure, avoiding damage to geometry or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A close inspection of the tripod in Image B reveals an extensive integration of metallic textures, enhancing its appearance through gears and mechanical adjustments synchronous with the steampunk theme. The original geometry and structural integrity are respected as these elements look fluidly merged with the tripod's dimensions and purpose, rather than altered or inappropriately textured. The overall depiction shows cohesiveness in form and structure respecting its industrial theme.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the Nikon logo and other text labels naturally integrated into the metallic design, remaining legible and consistent with the steampunk style without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the Nikon logo and text labels maintaining legibility, albeit transformed into a steampunk style. Unlike the more modern branding, it incorporates metallic engraving fittingly with the antique aesthetic without losing the original function of making the brand identifiable. This seamless integration supports the idea of preserved clarity amidst stylized modification, matching the mechanical theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting, shadowing, and reflection on the camera and tripod consistent and realistic within the steampunk illustration style, contributing to the image's natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadow rendering on the camera and tripod evoke a natural coherence matching the steampunk theme. The reflections gleam fittingly across metallic surfaces, enhancing texture visibility and contributing to depth perception, which reflects well on the image's authenticity and illustrative quality. The calculated use of light and shadow supports the mechanical overlay by ensuring it looks believable and professionally crafted, giving the design a realistic touch through dimensionality and stylistic detail.",
