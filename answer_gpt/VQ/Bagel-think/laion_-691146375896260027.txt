    "Question": "Q1: Are the brown LEGO bricks covering the dresser body evenly spaced and aligned, with no visible gaps or irregularities in the surface texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, which is a LEGO representation, the dresser's body is crafted with brown LEGO bricks. The cohesive design typically avoids gaps due to LEGO's uniform mold and snap-fit nature, which ensures bricks align tightly. Thus, barring visible gaps or irregularities is reasonable due to the precision manufacturing of LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the herringbone marquetry pattern on the front panels clearly defined and continuous, without broken lines or missing segments caused by improper LEGO piece placement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no herringbone marquetry pattern present as LEGO bricks are used, offering a simplified representation. The intricate pattern from Image A is absent due to the limited design capabilities of LEGO in mimicking complex marquetry patterns.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the gold decorative borders follow the original curved contours smoothly, without sharp angles or breaks in the flow of the design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative borders appear to contrast sharply with the flowing design in Image A, as LEGO construction naturally results in more angular structures. This causes breaks in the smoothness due to the brick-based nature of LEGO not perfectly replicating fluid curves.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the curved side panels and cabriole legs constructed with smoothly joined sloped bricks, showing no visible steps or angular breaks in the profile?",
    "explanation": "The curved side panels and cabriole legs in Image B, made of LEGO, continue the angular aesthetic LEGO normally creates. Thus, visual irregularities like steps and angular breaks are noticeable compared to the seamless curves of traditional construction seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the gray LEGO tile top sit flat and level on the dresser, with clean edges and no visible gaps or misalignments where it meets the sides?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gray LEGO tile top appears flat and level as LEGO typically ensures uniform edges and seamless connections, reducing visible gaps or misalignments thanks to the precise design and connection nature of LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
