    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the golden plumage retain the original featherâ€™s elongated shape and striped pattern without visible warping or irregular edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feather retains an elongated shape that's consistent with what a feather would typically look like. While the colors have changed to a vibrant yellow and orange representing golden plumage, the stripes or grooves that resemble a feather pattern are present, though there may be slight exaggeration in the contrast and saturation of the colors affecting perceived regularity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the iridescent tips at the end of the feather smoothly blended with the golden plumage, showing no jagged edges or unnatural light leaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tips of the feather do have visual transitions into the rest of the feather through a gradient effect where yellow meets the deep orange. However, the editing process introduces broader strokes and overemphasized brightness which may lead to unnatural light leaks and jagged edges due to lower resolution details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the ember-like orbs maintain spherical shape and uniform size, with swirling magma patterns that appear continuous and natural without broken lines or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orbs in Image B maintain a spherical shape. These orbs present swirling magma patterns. However, the excessive brightness and color saturation create instances of color bleeding and disturbances that break the fluidity or continuity of natural textures and patterns within the orbs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the phoenix claws correctly proportioned and shaped with natural joint angles, and does the flame they hold emit a soft, diffused glow without harsh outlines or unnatural brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The claws in Image B have become visually distorted due to the editing, losing precise proportions and showing unnatural joint angles that don't align well with typical bird anatomy. The flame present is exceedingly bright and lacks a soft, diffused glow, presenting instead with harsh outlines and inconsistent brightness.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the newly added magical elements (plumage, embers, claws, flame) cast shadows and reflect light consistently with the ambient lighting of the wooden surface, avoiding floating or disconnected appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited elements in Image B do not align perfectly with ambient lighting conditions. The vibrancy and brightness are exaggerated, causing these elements to appear as if they are not completely grounded or integrated into the scene. The shadows and light reflection are inconsistent compared to the expected natural setting on a wooden surface.",
