    "Question": "Q1: Does the long flowing robe have natural fabric draping and folds that follow the contours of the body without unnatural stretching or clumping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the flowing robe features visible folds and patterns that give an impression of natural draping. The fabric appears to lay smoothly across the body without signs of artificial stretching or clumping. The folds of the robe align with the sitting posture of the figure, suggesting an intentional design that follows the contours of the form. This depiction aligns with fabric behavior as it would drape naturally, showing expertise in craft akin to those demonstrated in fabric patterns seeing across art representations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the limbs and joints of the seated figure anatomically correct, with no distorted angles or disproportionate lengths?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the style of the figures is highly stylized, using characteristics of exaggeration commonly found in art. The limbs are simplified and rendered in a minimalistic manner. However, they follow a consistent proportion relative to the torso and body. The seated posture seems plausible given stylistic choices, without evident distortions or disproportionate angles that would appear abnormal in a simplistic art style. Additionally, the seated figure's posture fits within normative art conventions for seated figures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the eyes significantly larger than normal but still proportionally integrated into the face without distorting surrounding facial features?",
    "explanation": "Analysis of Image B illustrates that the eyes are indeed larger than what a realistic human depiction would feature. Still, given the stylization commonly observed in certain art forms, this enlargement maintains proportion with the simplified face, not causing visible distortion to surrounding facial features. The exaggerated eye size is typical of iconic artwork, where eyes are exaggerated to express more emotion or attract focus, fitting into the face design without causing visual inconsistency or imbalance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the mountain and lake reflections exhibit soft, blended watercolor transitions without sharp edges or artificial-looking brush strokes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection of the mountains and lake indeed appears to capture a watercolor medium's essence, characterized by its smooth, blended transitions and avoidance of harsh lines. Watercolors are typically associated with soft edges and natural flowing transitions between colors, which is effectively depicted in this image. Such transitions invoke the soft merging of hues and reflections, aligning with traditional watercolor techniques as seen in art.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the lilac-edged border uniformly applied around the image without overlapping or obscuring any part of the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lilac-edged border is visible and consistent, framing the image with a defined outline. It does not intrude or obscure any primary elements or details within the artistic scene. Observing the uniform application and placement of the border shows it maintains its position effectively, providing a framing aesthetic typical in illustrative format. As borders are often used to contain the artwork without detracting from it, the frame serves its artistic purpose without interference.",
    "answer": "Yes"
