        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handwritten notes on the calendar pages in Image B appear in a smooth, natural handwriting style. The dates, like the circled number '12', are clearly marked and do not show any signs of distortion, which would indicate irregularity in shape or illegibility. All notes resemble genuine handwritten text with appropriate proportions and pen pressure variation, which is consistent with authentic writing.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paper texture shows fine lines and creases that mimic typical paper characteristics, while the desk surface under the stack reflects a consistent matte finish with soft light and shadow transitions, indicating a natural light source. The shading on the desk and the paper pile is coherent without any abrupt lighting changes, supporting a believable interaction between objects and environment.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stack of calendar pages in Image B is organized in a tidy pile with clear, even edges and no visible disruptions in alignment on the calendar grid. The stacked pages reflect natural paper behavior, with slight variations in layer height as would happen in a real stack, reinforcing a logical arrangement.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar text and grid lines maintain sharpness and clarity. The numbers and letters are crisp and legible, showing no signs of blurring or loss of definition. This includes the lines that form the grid structure of the calendar, which are straight and uniform, ensuring the calendar's utility and readability.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors used for notes and highlights in Image B, such as the red for 'Wedding' and the blue circle around '12', appear consistent and replicate typical ink colors found in handwriting. There are no unexpected aberrations or saturation issues that would suggest unrealistic or unnatural coloring, ensuring that they blend smoothly within the overall color palette of the scene.",
