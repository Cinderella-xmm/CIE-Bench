      "question": "Is the elephant's size reduced proportionally so that its limbs, head, and body maintain correct relative proportions and do not appear stretched or compressed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant appears in a glass encasement alongside bonsai trees, suggesting a miniaturized setup. Despite the changed environment, the elephant maintains consistent proportions between its limbs, head, and body that match the original image's proportions seen in Image A. There's no visible distortion suggesting stretching or compression.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows added golden inlays to the elephant sculpture's intricate carvings. These inlays complement the existing contour patterns, with smooth transitions that integrate well without interrupting or mismatching the intricate wood designs, as analyzed visually without reference to Image A.",

      "question": "Are the bonsai trees positioned at a scale consistent with the miniaturized elephant and do they exhibit natural leaf shapes, branch structures, and ground-level placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays bonsai trees surrounding the small-scale elephant within the glass case. These trees appear consistent in scale relative to the elephant, and exhibit naturally shaped leaves and branch structures commonly found in real-world bonsai. Their placement is natural, harmonizing the scene effectively.",
