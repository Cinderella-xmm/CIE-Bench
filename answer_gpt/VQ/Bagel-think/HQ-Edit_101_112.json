      "question": "Does the kimono display consistent, non-distorted fabric folds with visible, harmonious pattern details that align with the woodblock print aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kimono in Image B is simplified with bold patterns typical of woodblock art. While detailed folds may be absent due to the stylized nature, the overall patterns are harmonious, with flowers and vibrant colors. This aligns well with the woodblock print aesthetic which often focuses on simplified, bold shapes and consistent patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossom petals in the air and on the ground evenly distributed with clear, non-overlapping edges and consistent size variation typical of stylized woodblock art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossom petals are depicted as solid shapes without overlapping edges, spread uniformly both in the air and on the ground. This portrayal is quite typical of stylized woodblock art where elements are often flat and simplified.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the matte texture applied uniformly across the entire image without obscuring facial features, fabric patterns, or the basketâ€™s weave structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The matte texture in Image B is evident, staying consistent throughout without affecting key features such as patterns on the kimono or the weave structure of the basket. The simplification follows the expected style of woodblock prints, maintaining clarity in these elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the basket preserve its cylindrical shape and handle structure with visible, coherent weaving lines, even if simplified?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The basket in Image B retains a cylindrical shape and has a simplified, yet discernible weave structure typical of woodblock art. Although more stylized, the handle is visible and maintains structural coherence.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands show five fingers per hand with natural joint alignment and no extra digits or unnatural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands, which are depicted with simplified forms typical of woodblock prints, do not clearly display individual fingers due to the art style. Therefore, assessing natural joint alignment or extra digits isn't applicable.",
