      "question": "Does the central green block retain its original geometric shape after being converted into a 3D chibi-style cartoon character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure that could correspond to the green block from Image A is the chibi-style cartoon character holding a red heart. This character has a significantly different form compared to the original geometric shape of a block, as it is now a stylized human figure. The green block is not visible as an independent geometric entity, indicating a transformation in both function and form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red blocks redesigned as lively supporting characters free from unnatural textures and maintain their original structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red blocks have been transformed into heart shapes scattered around the chibi character. These new shapes lack the structural integrity of the original rectangular block form, as they have a stylized and curved design suitable for a cartoon aesthetic. Therefore, while they maintain the red color, their transformation into heart shapes indicates a change in structure.",

      "question": "Does the transformed background with soft pastel colors blend naturally with the foreground elements without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a soft pastel pink background that effectively complements the foreground elements, including the heart shapes and the cartoon figure. This pastel background, along with the pastel-colored hearts, provides a visually smooth transition with no visible artifacts or mismatches between the elements and the background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the heart-shaped confetti elements evenly distributed and visually plausible without causing any loss of detail in the surrounding blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heart-shaped elements are scattered across the scene, providing a whimsical effect. They are uniformly dispersed and do not obstruct or reduce the visibility of other elements in the image, thus not causing any loss of detail in the surrounding areas.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the red blocks and the central green block maintain a consistent chibi aesthetic without any noticeable inconsistencies in style or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual motif follows a chibi aesthetic very consistently. The heart shapes, which replace the red blocks, as well as the central chibi figure, are all styled in this whimsical, cartoon-like manner. There is no visible inconsistency in texture or style across these elements, suggesting compliance with the theme.",
