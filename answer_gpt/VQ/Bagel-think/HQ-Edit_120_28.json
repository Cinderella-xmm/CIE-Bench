      "question": "Is the treasure chest still geometrically intact and proportionally consistent with its original form when placed on the newly added weathered map background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the treasure chest is depicted on a weathered map background. The visual cues show that the chest retains its original geometric integrity and proportions as observed with the aligned rivets and wood texture consistent with the original chest form. The map background provides a different context, but does not alter the chest's geometry.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ropes used as decorative borders maintain their natural fiber texture and realistic coil shapes without appearing stretched, flattened, or unnaturally contorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative borders seem to incorporate rope-like spirals. These elements maintain a consistent texture and appear three-dimensional with natural fiber-like detail, aligned realistically with the overall aesthetic of the image, hence not contorted or unnaturally altered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the symbols and ancient-style text in the legend aligned properly with the overall lighting and depth of the image, and do they appear cleanly rendered without jagged edges or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual details in Image B show symbols and text in the legend are matched to the background in terms of lighting and depth. These elements are cleanly rendered without any noticeable jagged edges or color bleeding, maintaining a consistent style that complements the weathered map aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the compass rose in the bottom-right corner have consistent metallic sheen and shadowing that aligns with the lighting direction and material properties of the surrounding gold coins and gems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observations from Image B show the compass rose with a metallic sheen consistent with the lighting direction seen in the rest of the image. This is demonstrated in the shadows and reflective properties similar to those on the coins and gems in the original chest scene, enhancing the cohesive appearance of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sea monster motifs seamlessly blended into the map background, maintaining consistent line thickness and shading with the rest of the ink drawings, and do they not appear as disjointed or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sea monster motifs appear as part of the map's graphical elements. These motifs maintain consistent line thickness and shading with the ink drawings present throughout the image. The motifs are integrated seamlessly into the texture and style of the map, enhancing its thematic consistency without appearing disjointed.",
