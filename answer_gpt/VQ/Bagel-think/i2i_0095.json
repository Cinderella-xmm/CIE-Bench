      "question": "Does the word 'Shine' appear seamlessly integrated into the mirror with no visible artifacts or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Shine' is directly on the mirror’s surface. The edges of the word appear smooth and do not display any visible pixels or jagged lines that would suggest artifacts from digital editing. Based on visual inspection, it looks like the word was cleanly integrated, suggesting no unnatural edges are present. This integration appears to be done cleanly within the frame of the mirror.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the style and glow effect of the word 'Shine' consistent with the aesthetic of the bathroom and does not look out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bathroom in Image B is modern, with a minimalist design and clean lines. The word 'Shine' uses a modern, script font with a warm glow effect that complements the ambient lighting around the mirror. The glow effect mimics typical LED lighting used in contemporary bathroom designs, making it consistent with the aesthetic. It enhances the modern feel rather than clashing with it.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the addition of the word 'Shine' maintain the mirror's original shape and proportions, avoiding any geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror retains its rectangular shape, and the proportions appear unchanged from a typical mirror. The addition of the word 'Shine' has not altered the frame or the overall dimensions. There are no signs of geometric distortion such as stretching or warping caused by the addition of text. Comparing this with Image A, the mirror’s shape and proportions are consistent.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the reflective properties of the mirror undisturbed by the addition of 'Shine', preserving the clarity and detail of the mirror’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of the word 'Shine' on the mirror does not appear to alter the reflective properties of the rest of the mirror surface, as the areas around the text remain clear and undisturbed. Normally, the reflective quality of the mirror would cast reflections or show detail; in Image B, the non-text portions remain consistent with such expectations, maintaining clarity outside the area occupied by the text.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the positioning, size, and lighting of the word 'Shine' seem authentic, enhancing rather than detracting from the visual credibility of the bathroom setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Shine' in Image B is positioned centrally within the mirror, which is a typical placement for such designs aiming to attract attention. The size is proportional to the mirror, not overwhelming in the context and allows for readability while maintaining visual balance. The lighting effect of the word harmonizes with the mirror’s built-in backlighting, suggesting an intentional design choice, thus adding authenticity and enhancing the overall bathroom decor.",
