      "question": "Does the transformed book maintain consistent proportions and structural integrity when opened into a pop-up form, without warped edges or floating components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is transformed into a pop-up scene featuring miniature soldiers emerging from it. The proportions appear consistent and the structural integrity is maintained as the book rests firmly on the base. The soldiers are structured realistically inside the book’s frame, without visible warping or floating components. This judgment is based on visual cues and the typical characteristics of well-designed pop-up structures that maintain their dimensional stability.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the quill positioned centrally and vertically as a stable pivot, with natural feather texture and metallic base that match the original materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The quill in Image B is positioned within a glass dome, appearing central and vertical, maintaining a balance similar to how quills are often positioned in holders for stability. The feather texture is rendered naturally, with details matching original quill characteristics. The metallic base retains the golden hue seen previously, suggesting a continuity of material. Visual analysis confirms the quill's stability and consistency in texture matching.",

      "question": "Does the inkwell’s transformation into a fountain include realistic water flow and surface reflections without unnatural highlights or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the inkwell does not appear to have transformed into a fountain but remains an integral part of the display. Hence, any absence of water flow or surface reflections is not applicable as it hasn't been transformed, and there are no indications of geometry alterations or highlights inappropriate to its form.",

      "question": "Is the glass cloche transparent and free of distortion, with smooth curvature and accurate light refraction across all internal elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a glass cloche that covers the book and miniature soldiers. It shows transparency, permitting clear visibility of the items within. The curvature is smooth, and light is refracted evenly, ensuring a distortion-free portrayal. The contours of the soldiers and book are clearly visible, suggesting an accurate depiction of light refraction under common glass properties.",

      "question": "Are the engraved lines on the wooden base continuous, legible, and integrated with the wood texture without sharp breaks or unnatural depth variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base exhibits engraved lines around the circumference. These appear continuous and integrated with the wood texture, maintaining legibility without sharp breaks or unnatural depth variations. The engraving is consistent with typical wooden texture designs, supporting a seamless visual integration.",
