      "question": "Does the Ancient Greek-style armor fit the characterâ€™s torso and limbs without distorting muscle contours or creating unnatural gaps or overlaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing the edited image, the armor on the character seems to fit snugly over the muscular torso and limbs without causing any visible distortion to the muscle contours. There are no unnatural gaps or overlaps, suggesting the armor is well-fitted. The visual details, supported by the assumption that Greek-style armor typically complements the body's natural shape, indicate that the armor aligns well with the character's physique.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the joints of the armored limbs articulated properly, and is the sword held in a position that does not bend or stretch the arm beyond natural limits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the joints of the armored limbs appear to be properly articulated. The way the character holds the sword does not suggest that the arm is bent or stretched beyond its natural range of motion. The arm positions align with a normally relaxed stance, which is typical for a character holding a weapon efficiently.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the character with a barbell placed evenly across the shoulders. Both hands grip the barbell, with a balanced stance indicating stability.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Across the three illustrated versions in the edited image, the heads appear to be proportionate in size relative to the neck and upper torso. There are no discernible proportions that suggest the head is either too large or too small, nor is there any misalignment observed.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In each version shown in the edited image, the hands are depicted with five fingers, and the joint curvatures appear natural. The grip on the sword or barbell is realistic and reflects common anatomical proportions, without any abnormalities such as distortion or extra digits.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
