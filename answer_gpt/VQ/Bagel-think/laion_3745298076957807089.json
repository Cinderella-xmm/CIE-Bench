    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass stopper on the bottle have a smooth, reflective surface consistent with real glass, and does it fit proportionally with the bottle's neck without appearing oversized or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object displayed has the visual characteristics of a diffuser rather than a bottle with a glass stopper. The diffuser reeds are inserted into a sleek green container with a reflective surface, possibly emulating glass or high-quality plastic. Considering the proportion of the stopper to the container, there is a default assumption of proportionality due to its typical design. Hence, there is no evidence of size or alignment issues inconsistent with common design practices for such items.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the diffuser reeds straight, evenly spaced, and properly aligned with the stopper, showing no signs of jagged edges, unnatural bending, or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diffuser reeds appear straight and evenly spaced, which is typical for diffusers to ensure effective scent distribution. The alignment with the stopper is visually correct, with no observable jagged edges, bending, or clipping artifacts. These attributes conform to the norms for diffuser designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the art deco label properly aligned on the front of the bottle, maintaining its rectangular shape and correct proportions without visible warping or texture distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a green container with graphic designs and text. The alignment of the illustrations and text on a container differs from label alignment on a bottle. The design elements are closely related to diffuser aesthetics, so the term 'art deco label' is not directly applicable to Image B. Nonetheless, the elements on the container exhibit proper alignment and proportions with no visible warping or distortion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the floral and botanical illustrations on the label have clear outlines, natural shading, and consistent scale relative to the surrounding text and design elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral and botanical illustrations are prominently displayed on the green container with clear outlines and consistent shading, which gives them a natural look. The scale is proportional relative to the surrounding text and design elements, maintaining aesthetic harmony typical of decorative diffusers or containers with embellished designs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the emerald green and gold colors on the label applied smoothly without visible color fringing, banding, or abrupt transitions between hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color application on the green container in Image B, including emerald green and gold hues, appears smooth without visual artifacts like fringing, banding, or abrupt color transitions. The consistency of these colors contributes to a visually pleasing and coherent design, in line with quality decorative objects.",
