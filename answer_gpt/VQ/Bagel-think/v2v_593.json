      "question": "Does the Funko Pop figure box maintain a natural texture similar to the original kangaroo's fur, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop figure box is typically made of cardboard or similar materials, which naturally lack the texture of fur. In Image B, the box features a graphic design and printed text, which are common for Funko Pop boxes. The smooth surface and printed elements are expected and do not resemble the texture of fur from the original kangaroo. This is a typical representation of a product packaging that does not aim to mimic real animal fur.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style kangaroo figure inside the box retain the correct proportions and structural consistency, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style kangaroo figure is characterized by exaggerated features like a larger head and eyes, which are typical of this design style. Image B shows a consistent chibi style without any apparent distortions or deformations. The proportions are intentional to fit the stylistic approach, and there are no visible errors in the form.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the highly realistic kangaroo figure outside the packaging display detailed textures and lighting consistent with the original image, enhancing its visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the realistic kangaroo figure is a product of fun design interpretation rather than a faithful recreation of the original kangaroo's textures and lighting. The chibi figure is simplified and stylized, designed more for visual appeal in toy form rather than realism. There is no attempt to convey detailed textures or realistic lighting as seen in the original image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the grassy base and hopping-related elements integrated naturally into the chibi-style kangaroo figure, without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kangaroo figure is mounted on a grassy base, typical of display figures. This base shows texture appropriate for toy vegetation and does not present any unnatural artifacts or loss of detail. The integration fits the visual and stylistic theme of the figure and does not compromise the overall design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition and layout of the Funko Pop figure box and the realistic kangaroo figure beside it appear visually credible and structurally coherent within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop box and the chibi kangaroo are positioned side by side in Image B in a typical display setup for such figures. The scene emphasizes the comparison between the item in the box and the figure outside. However, there isn't a realistic kangaroo figure beside the box; instead, the chibi figure is outside the box while 'realistic' refers only to its enhanced details within its stylized constraints. The setup is visually coherent for its purpose.",
