      "question": "Do the hippo and rabbit maintain their natural proportions and structural consistency in the 3D cartoon design without any visible distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the hippo and rabbit are depicted with exaggerated features typical of 3D cartoons, such as larger eyes and rounded shapes, which deviate from natural proportions. This is a stylistic choice common in animations to enhance appeals but results in visible distortions from their natural forms as seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gentle lighting and cozy tones in the 3D design enhance the natural appearance of the hippo and rabbit without creating any unnatural highlights or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is soft and evenly distributed across the hippo and rabbit, avoiding harsh shadows or unrealistic highlights. This type of lighting is typical in 3D designs to create a warm and appealing appearance, but it doesn't necessarily enhance a 'natural' look compared to the direct sunlight in Image A.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the hippo's skin texture and the rabbit's fur preserved in the 3D design without any loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, as a 3D cartoon representation, lacks the intricate textures seen in Image A, such as the hippo's skin wrinkles and the rabbit's fur detail. Instead, it uses simplified textures typical of cartoons, leading to a loss of natural detail and introduction of stylized patterns.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the placement of the title banner and nameplate integrate seamlessly with the 3D design of the hippo and rabbit, maintaining visual credibility and not disrupting the harmony between the characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The banner and nameplate in Image B are positioned to frame the characters within a design typical of cards or games, and they do not visibly disrupt the layout or interaction between the hippo and rabbit. This integration follows typical 3D game or card design conventions, maintaining visual harmony.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the nature-inspired backdrop with earthy greens and rich tones blend naturally with the 3D design of the hippo and rabbit, avoiding any visual inconsistencies or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop features earthy greens that complement the stylized 3D design of the hippo and rabbit. While the textures and colors are not natural like in Image A, they are consistent with the cartoon aesthetic and do not introduce visual discrepancies within the 3D artistic framework.",
