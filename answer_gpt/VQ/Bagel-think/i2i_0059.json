      "question": "Are the mechanical elements like copper pipes and gears on the elephant integrated naturally, without appearing out of place against the background of the plate of food?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a mechanical elephant with copper pipes and gears, while the background theme in Image B is totally different, showcasing tourists on a steampunk elephant. The background doesn't feature food at all, hence these elements don't integrate naturally with any food scene. This question seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the image context.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tourists wearing goggles appear to have well-fitted goggles on their faces with no visible artifacts or loss of detail around the edges of the goggles. They seem integrated into their faces naturally, reflecting a careful editing process.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a scene where the steampunk elephant, tourists, and background maintain a consistent theme of a mechanical, brass-toned, possibly fantasy-filled environment. The foggy setting complements the color and theme of the mechanical elephant, creating a coherent scene suitable for a steampunk aesthetic.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
