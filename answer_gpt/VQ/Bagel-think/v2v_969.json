      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D figures inside the snow globe maintain the correct proportions and avoid unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are depicted in a chibi style, known for exaggerated proportions such as larger heads. Despite this stylization, the figures within the snow globe appear proportionate and consistent. The shapes and dimensions align with expectations for chibi figures, with no signs of unnatural geometric distortion or disproportional elements. By examining the overall balance and symmetry of each figure, it can be inferred that stylized proportions are intentional and appropriately executed.",

      "question": "Does the light layer of snow on the grass inside the snow globe appear natural without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the snow within the globe is depicted as a light covering over a grass base, consistent with common design for depicting snow in small-scale models. The texture looks smooth and visually blends well with the scene, avoiding unnatural textures or artifacts, which could include inconsistent coloring or harsh transitions. Based on typical artistic representations of snow in miniature scenes, the snow layer appears natural.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the snow globe rest naturally on the rustic wooden shelf with soft sunlight filtering through, creating believable warm, golden reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the snow globe resting on what seems to be a wooden base. However, there is no visible shelf or indication of sunlight filtering through the scene, eliminating the opportunity for golden reflections. Common visual effects associated with sunlight reflections include shadow casting and highlight effects, which are absent. The existing visual cues don't support the scene described in the question.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bats propped against the fence inside the snow globe depicted with natural textures and shapes, avoiding any distortion or unnatural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bats are visually clear with a texture and shape consistent with miniature representations of baseball bats. The depiction maintains realistic curvature and details synonymous with bats, avoiding distortion or deviation from natural appearances. Assessment involves recognizing known bat features such as smooth texture and cylindrical shape, which are accurately captured in this depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition between the interior scene of the snow globe and the vintage baseball clubhouse backdrop smooth, without any visible artifacts or breaks in continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B contains an interior scene featuring trees and a structure resembling a clubhouse. The transition within the small-scale interior is smooth, with elements harmoniously integrated. Recognizing continuity involves checking for consistent textures and seamless integration of components like models and backdrop, which Image B appears to achieve without visible artifacts or disjointed transitions.",
