      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the metallic texture applied to the scanner's body exhibit consistent highlights and reflections that align with the light source direction, avoiding patchy or overly shiny areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scanner has a shiny metallic texture applied to its body. When analyzing this, the highlights and reflections should follow the light source direction naturally, creating a cohesive appearance without patchiness or excessive shininess which might point to unrealistic rendering. In this image, the highlights and reflections appear consistent and do not exhibit excessive shine or patchiness, indicating proper alignment with light source directions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the holographic display integrated into the front panel with translucent edges and layered visual depth, maintaining alignment with the scannerâ€™s shape and not appearing as a simple 2D overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic display in Image B should appear as an integrated part of the scanner's design with translucent edges, showing depth through layering, and aligning with the scanner's overall shape. It should not look flat as if pasted on the surface. However, the visual depth and integration are executed poorly here as the holographic pieces present a mostly 2D appearance without notable translucency or three-dimensionality typical of properly rendered holographics.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the grid lines evenly spaced and aligned with the orientation of the device, forming continuous patterns without jagged edges or interruptions that suggest digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In considering the grid lines seen in Image B, they should provide an evenly spaced, continuous pattern free from digital distortions like jagged edges. However, upon observation, these lines exhibit discontinuities and abrupt changes suggesting digital artifacting rather than a coherent grid pattern aligned with the scanner's orientation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tech-themed icons and branding clearly legible, properly scaled, and positioned in non-intrusive areas such as the lower corners or sides, without overlapping critical components like the control panel or paper path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tech-themed icons and branding in Image B should be scaled appropriately and positioned so they are not obstructing crucial areas like the control panel or paper path. Yet, it appears the icons are quite large, and their placement is intrusive, compromising readability and clarity, as evident from their overlap with different areas designed for functionality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the transformed packaging retain the same overall dimensions and spatial relationships between components (e.g., paper feed slot, control panel area) as the original scanner, preventing distortion or misalignment of key parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging transformation in Image B should preserve the spatial relationships and dimensions seen in Image A, ensuring no distortion or misalignment. However, Image B shows altered proportions, suggesting a distortion of the original layout and misalignment of key elements like the paper feed and control panel, diverging from Image A's structure.",
