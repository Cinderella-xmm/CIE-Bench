      "question": "Is the spherical glass dome transparent and smooth, with no visible seams, distortions, or incorrect light refractions affecting the sandcastle inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spherical glass dome in Image B appears to be transparent and smooth, showcasing a clear view of the sandcastle inside. Observing the dome, there are no visible seams or distortions. The light refraction appears correct as there are no unusual warping effects on the objects inside. This suggests the glass dome is well crafted and does not interfere visually with the display inside.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the mahogany base have a natural wood texture and consistent thickness, and is it properly scaled to support the dome and sandcastle without appearing distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mahogany base in Image B presents a natural wood texture, which is indicated by its grain patterns that resemble typical hardwood. The base appears to have a consistent thickness throughout and is proportionally scaled to hold the dome and sandcastle without showing signs of distortion. The presence of these characteristics points to a well-constructed base that supports the overall composition harmoniously.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glittering grains evenly distributed and subtle enough to mimic sand texture without obscuring fine architectural details of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glittering grains look evenly distributed around the base of the sandcastle. They are subtle enough not to overshadow or obscure the detailed features of the sandcastle, such as its arches and towers. This effect adds a sense of realism to the scene, mimicking the texture of actual sand while preserving the intricate design of the sandcastle.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the seashells around the sandcastle clearly defined, appropriately small in scale, and free from pixelation or unnatural edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seashells positioned around the sandcastle appear well-defined and realistically scaled to fit the scene, with no pixelation or unnatural edge artifacts that might detract from their appearance. The clarity and detail of the shells contribute to an overall authentic and aesthetically pleasing beachside environment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ceramic plaque with “Empire of the Shores” inscribed clearly readable, properly attached to the base, and displaying a uniform matte pearl surface without glare or texture mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ceramic plaque in Image B, labeled as “Drlhver Crsations”, does not match the inscription stated in the question. The text appears unclear and unrecognizable. Additionally, while the attachment to the base seems secure, there is no indication of the matte pearl surface, and the phrasing is incorrect, which signals a mismatch in the editing narrative.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the matte pearl finish uniformly applied across the sandcastle and surrounding shells, with no areas showing excessive shine or reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the visual assessment of Image B, the finish on the sandcastle and surrounding shells seems consistently matte, offering no significant evidence of excess shine or reflection. The finish creates a cohesive and realistic interpretation of a sand-like surface, maintaining the integrity of the material appearance throughout.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all architectural elements of the sandcastle (towers, stairs, arches) intact and geometrically consistent, with no stretching, bending, or missing sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle is depicted with all architectural elements—towers, stairs, and arches—intact and consistent in their geometry. There are no visible signs of stretching, bending, or missing sections across the structure. This coherence provides a sense of realism and structural soundness within the miniature scene.",
