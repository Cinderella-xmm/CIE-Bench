      "question": "Does the curved glass dome have a smooth, seamless surface without visible seams, scratches, or unnatural distortions that disrupt the visual continuity of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome surrounding the ship creates a visually appealing setting for the miniature model. Upon examining Image B, the glass dome appears to have a smooth and clear surface. There are no visible seams, scratches, or distortions on the dome. The reflections and transparency through the dome look natural and continuous. This analysis is based on observing the visual cues in Image B and using common knowledge that a well-crafted glass object typically exhibits these traits.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the sails exhibit layered, folded paper-like textures with consistent shadows and depth, without geometric distortions or flattened areas that deviate from their original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sails in Image B are part of a ship miniature inside a glass dome, showing a distinct paper-like texture with visible layers and folds. The shadows and depth in the texture seem consistent, suggesting the sails maintain their intended shapes without apparent flattening or distortion. This evaluation comes from the observation of the sails' appearance, where the paper texture and consistent shadows reflect common characteristics of paper crafting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the blue resin layer below the ship show consistent translucency, internal glow, and wave-like patterns without abrupt transitions or unnatural textures at the hull interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue resin below the ship is depicted with wave-like patterns that have consistent translucency and a subtle internal glow. The interaction between the resin and the hull seems smooth without abrupt changes or unnatural transitions. This assessment relies on the visual cues in Image B that match typical resin characteristics, which usually exhibit a natural translucency and glow when crafted to mimic water.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the seagulls connected by faint, straight wires that do not interfere with their natural flight positions or create visible mechanical supports?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the seagulls are visible inside the glass dome. They are likely crafted to appear suspended, possibly connecting them with faint wires to give the impression of flight. These wires are discreet and do not disrupt the birds' positions, nor do they create noticeable mechanical support. The analysis is based on observing how miniature models are often displayed, with elements like birds using nearly invisible supports to maintain aesthetic appeal in dioramas or globes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all elements (ship, sails, water, birds, sky) correctly positioned and scaled within the glass dome without clipping, overlapping, or misalignment that compromises structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements - ship, sails, water, and birds - appear well-integrated within the glass dome. There is no evidence of clipping, overlapping, or misalignment that disrupts the miniature's composition. Each element is correctly scaled, adhering to common miniaturization techniques that ensure visual coherence. This assessment depends on evaluating the scene's structural model in Image B, where all elements fit harmoniously within the confines of the dome.",
