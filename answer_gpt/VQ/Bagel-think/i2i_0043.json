      "question": "Does the anime-style conversion of the athlete retain the original pose structure without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the athlete is depicted in a crouched position similar to Image A with a tennis racket in hand. The pose appears intact and faithful to the original, with the legs and arms forming natural angles. Visual cues such as the leg bend and racket placement match the original, suggesting the pose structure is maintained without distortion. The conversion to anime style enhances the aesthetic but does not alter fundamental pose dynamics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the enhanced facial expressions (focused eyes and light effects) integrated seamlessly into the athlete's face and do not appear as unnatural overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial expression of the athlete shows focused eyes with stylized light effects, which fit the anime aesthetic. These visual elements align with typical anime characterization where expressive eyes are a focal point. The effects appear naturally blended into the face and do not look out of place or as if they were superimposed unnaturally.",

      "question": "Does the added background energy glow contribute positively to the atmosphere without causing unnatural lighting or breaking the scene's visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains vibrant energy glow designs that enhance the dynamic nature of the scene. The choices of color and style are consistent with anime depictions of energy or action scenes, enhancing the atmosphere and suggesting motion or intensity. The glow complements the athlete rather than clashing, ensuring coherence without disrupting visual integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the proportions and physical realism of the athlete’s hands, feet, and tennis racket been maintained during the style conversion, avoiding unnatural shapes or sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the athlete's hands and feet maintain realistic proportions similar to those in Image A, even when adapted to the stylized nature of anime. The tennis racket's size and hand placement are consistent with real-life usage. The conversion maintains believability and avoids exaggerated or unrealistic proportions typical of some stylistic adaptations.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character card banner format present the edited athlete in a manner that retains authenticity and visual clarity, without sacrificing the original scene’s natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The card banner format used in Image B offers a stylized presentation that fits within the conventions of animated or game card visuals. The edited athlete maintains clarity and authenticity through retained pose and action signals. While the style is distinctly different, this format holds visual clarity, preserving the essence of competitive spirit seen in tennis without losing the narrative from Image A.",
