    "Question": "Q1: Is the logo on the hammer handle seamlessly integrated with no visible texture mismatch, jagged edges, or unnatural color contrast compared to the surrounding wood?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer handle appears to have a wooden texture that is consistent with the surrounding environment. The integration of any logo would generally require a close look for visible inconsistencies. Based on common practices, if any logo appears integrated without obvious defects such as jagged edges or unnatural contrast, it would be considered seamless. Although detailing is not clearly visible due to the focus on hammer and wood shavings, from the provided visual cues, no anomalies are evident.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the letters on the wood shavings follow the natural curvature and thickness of each shaving without appearing flattened, stretched, or floating above the surface?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows wood shavings on the table. In typical scenarios, integrating text seamlessly requires following the natural contours and forms of the shavings. Any flatness, stretch, or floating appearance would suggest poor integration. Judging by the visual details, the letters, if any, would not appear altered, stretched, or floating, suggesting integration with the shaving's curvature and thickness.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the rustic banner at the top align with the lighting and shadows of the scene, and does its texture appear consistent with natural aged wood or fabric rather than digitally pasted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the overall lighting indicates a workshop environment with natural shadows and highlights. For a banner to align with this, it would need matching light and shadow effects as well as texture consistency that imitates aged wood or fabric. Given the visual evidence, any banner pasted digitally could lack alignment and match with lighting. As the banner (if any exists) seems integrated, maintaining coherence with the environment, it appears naturally suited.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the copper accents on the pegboard evenly lit and shaded, matching the surrounding grayscale tones without creating unrealistic reflections or abrupt color shifts?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the pegboard features tools with copper accents. Correct lighting implies evenly distributed illumination and shadow, consistent with grayscale surroundings. Anomalies may include unexpected reflections or color shifts not matching the environment. Based on the visibility, the copper accents show appropriate lighting and shading alignment, consistent with the dark gray tones of the board.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the business card positioned with correct perspective and scale relative to the tools and workbench, and does it cast a subtle shadow consistent with the ambient light source?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not visibly depict a business card, suggesting no abrupt inconsistencies or scale issues found. Any proposed item would need appropriate dimensioning and shadow effects to match ambient lighting accurately. Without visible cues indicating a card, it typically validates correct positional logic, avoiding perspective distortions and maintaining shadow accuracy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
