      "question": "Does the 3D cartoon style of the thermometer maintain its structural consistency without introducing unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thermometer appears in a 3D cartoon style with smooth, consistent shapes that maintain the thermometer's structural integrity. The body of the thermometer is well-rounded, and the dial, the numbers, and the needle all appear intact without irregularities. The consistent proportions and lack of any visible distortions or breaks indicate that the cartoon style maintains structural consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the soft lighting effects on the thermometer's metallic surface natural, enhancing its finish without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic surface of the thermometer in Image B has a soft lighting effect, creating a subtle shine and maintaining the smoothness typical of metal textures. The lighting highlights the metallic areas without introducing any harsh reflections or losing the nuances of shape details, such as edges and curves. This indicates the lighting effect enhances the finish naturally.",

      "question": "Do the added stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] appear naturally integrated into the design without causing visual clutter or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there does not appear to be any added stats like [Temperature Range +200] or [Accuracy +10°C]. The existing elements are integrated without overcrowding the space or making the dial unreadable. As these specific stats are not present, I conclude that no visual clutter or distortion is caused by them.",

      "question": "Are the title banner and nameplate text elements positioned logically and clearly visible, contributing to the overall visual credibility without disrupting the layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the temperature gauge is framed by a title banner at the bottom that says 'TEMPERATURE.' The text is prominent and oriented logically at the bottom. The additional text under 'TEMPERATURE' appears as distorted and unclear, which detracts from the visual credibility, disrupting the layout and impacting how the content is perceived.",

      "question": "Do the crisp borders and cool-toned background complement the thermometer's function and appearance, maintaining a professional and authentic look without introducing visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cool-toned background with crisp borders that create a clean and professional presentation of the thermometer. There appear to be no distracting visual artifacts, and the colors chosen complement the practical aspect of the mercury-based gauge by emphasizing clarity and precision. This creates an aesthetically pleasing and authentic appearance.",
