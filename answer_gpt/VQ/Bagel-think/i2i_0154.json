      "question": "Are there any noticeable artifacts or breaks in the car's bodywork where the different views meet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observe the car's bodywork closely to check for any abrupt transitions or mismatches where different perspectives of the car might intersect. A careful examination should reveal any inconsistencies in alignment or disruptions in surface continuity. Given that Image B combines two perspectives, checking for seams, alignment issues, or overlapping parts is essential. There doesn't appear to be obvious mismatches or cuts between these perspectives.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do all views of the car maintain consistent material properties and lighting, avoiding unnatural differences?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examine the paint, reflections, and shadows across both views of the car to ensure they exhibit a consistent finish and are lit uniformly. The paint's glossiness, the way light reflects off the car's body, and the shadows should appear natural and in harmony with each other. This involves ensuring that both perspectives of the car reflect light similarly, suggesting they are part of the same lighting environment. There are no conspicuous differences in light reflection or material look between these views.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the car's geometry appear proportionally correct and undistorted across all views, particularly in the wheels and body panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, focus on elements such as the wheels and body panels to ascertain that they retain a believable and accurate shape. These components should appear naturally proportioned and consistent with the typical appearance of the vehicle in all views. The wheels, for instance, should maintain a round shape without signs of distortion across perspectives. In reviewing all visible angles, the car's geometry does not show any visible distortions or proportion errors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "In the top view, are the car's roofline and window outlines clear and detailed, without any loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's top view should be scrutinized for clarity and detail, specifically focusing on the roofline and the outlines of windows. These should be sharp and well-defined, continuing to uphold the fine detailing expected in a high-quality photograph of a vehicle. Important details include the crispness of the roof edges and the visibility of window outlines. The top view in Image B maintains these details without noticeable blurriness or loss of definition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the newly added views of the car integrate seamlessly with the background, without introducing any disruptive discontinuities or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Consider how convincingly the car's images in Image B blend into their surroundings. This involves ensuring the car's position, shadowing, and edge quality remain consistent with the background environment, supporting a unified visual presentation. Any new views should not look out of place or clashing with the setting. The edited image integrates the multiple views of the car seamlessly with the background, maintaining a coherent scene without apparent mismatches or visual disruptions.",
