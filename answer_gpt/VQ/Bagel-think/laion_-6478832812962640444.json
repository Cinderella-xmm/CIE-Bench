    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the areas previously featuring stitched embroidery (on the shaft and vamp) now display consistent metallic inlay textures with no visible seams, texture breaks, or mismatched gloss levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot's surface appears to have consistent metallic inlay textures. The previous stitched embroidery visible in Image A is replaced by this sleek, continuous design in Image B, without visible seams or texture breaks, giving it a uniform appearance throughout.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the newly designed stepped heel structurally aligned with the sole and boot shaft, with clean geometric edges and no floating or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a geometric, stylized heel that is integrated with the boot's sole and shaft. The alignment appears correct, with clean, straight edges, indicating no visible floating or misalignment issues, which suggests a coherent and intentional design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the transformed patterns along the shaft and toe area composed of sharp, consistent geometric lines without distorting the boot's outline or causing unnatural swelling or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design in Image B employs sharp geometric lines that are consistent and do not seem to distort the overall outline of the boot. The patterns are applied in a way that retains the natural contours of the boot without leading to any swelling or compression artifacts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the metallic inlays exhibit uniform specular highlights without bright spots, halos, or uneven reflections that suggest digital noise or over-processing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic surfaces in Image B reflect light evenly, showing smooth specular highlights. There is an absence of bright spots, halos, or any form of uneven reflections, suggesting high quality rendering without digital noise or over-processing issues.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the boot maintain a natural foot-shaped profile with properly proportioned toe box, ankle, and shaft height, without unnatural elongation, compression, or asymmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot retains a shape that resembles a natural foot profile, with appropriate proportions for the toe box, ankle, and shaft. There are no signs of elongation or compression that would make it look asymmetrical or unrealistic.",
