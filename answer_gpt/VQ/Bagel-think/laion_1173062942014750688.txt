    "Question": "Q1: Are the individual bead segments aligned in a smooth, continuous curve that mimics the natural curvature of a serpent's body without abrupt angular breaks or misaligned joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the beads are arranged in a curved formation. A serpent's body generally exhibits a smooth, flowing curvature with joints that align in a cohesive manner without abrupt changes. The visual impression from Image B shows the bead arrangement forming a curve that resembles this quality, indicating they are aligned in a smooth, continuous curve similar to a serpent's body.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the blue circular elements positioned at the head end of the serpent in a symmetrical, forward-facing arrangement typical of animal eyes, and do they appear integrated into the surface rather than floating or disconnected?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blue circular elements, suggested to be eye-like, are observed at the beginning of the bead formation. Animal eyes are generally positioned to be forward-facing and symmetrical for balance. The blue elements in Image B are integrated into the bead surface, not appearing as separate or floating entities, aligning well with these attributes of animal eyes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the black tribal markings follow the natural flow of the serpent’s body segments and avoid sharp, unnatural edges or uniform repetition that suggests digital artifacting?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows black tribal markings along the beads. Ideally, these markings should flow naturally with the contours of the beads to mimic the natural patterns found on a serpent's body. The image demonstrates these markings aligned with the flow of the bead segments, lacking abrupt edges or repetitive patterns characteristic of digital artifacts, thus presenting a natural continuity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the tail extend naturally from the rear of the serpent, tapering smoothly and ending in small, loosely connected bead-like tips that appear to hang or sway without breaking the continuity of the structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tail comprises a series of beads extending from the main body. A naturally tapering tail should smoothly transition into smaller segments or tips. The image demonstrates this by showing the tail ending with smaller bead-like tips that appear loosely connected and capable of swaying, maintaining the structural continuity typical of a serpent’s tail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the surface texture of the serpent’s body uniformly matte or slightly glossy like the original beads, without introducing areas of unnatural shine, roughness, or inconsistent material properties?",
    "explanation": "Image B exhibits a surface texture that appears consistent with the properties seen in Image A. The serpent’s body in Image B maintains a uniformity that is either matte or with a slight gloss typical of bead materials, without unexpected variations in texture such as shiny or rough spots. This continuity reflects a consistent material property similar to the original beads.",
    "answer": "Yes"
