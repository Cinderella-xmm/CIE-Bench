    "Question": "Q1: Does the holographic dragon eye on the watch face exhibit smooth gradients and consistent lighting without pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural glow artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The holographic dragon eye displayed on the screen has a vivid and intricate design, with sharp details and smooth gradients that suggest careful attention to lighting and blending. There is no visible pixelation or jagged edges around the eye, and the glow appears natural, enhancing the overall aesthetic without creating harsh artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the silver scales on the band evenly aligned, properly shaded, and free from gaps or overlapping segments that break geometric continuity?",
    "explanation": "The silver scales on the watch band are designed to appear uniformly aligned, contributing to a harmonious visual flow. The shading is consistent and precise, with no apparent gaps or overlapping segments that could disrupt the continuity or geometric structure of the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the glowing neural node on the side of the watch case properly integrated with the casing, showing consistent illumination and no unnatural light leakage or distortion in shape?",
    "explanation": "The neural node is seamlessly integrated into the design of the watch casing, with illumination that is evenly distributed across its surface. There are no signs of unnatural light leakage, nor is there any distortion in its shape, indicating a well-executed design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the luminescent control sigils on the watch face maintain clear boundaries and consistent brightness levels without blurring or ghosting around their edges?",
    "explanation": "The luminescent control sigils are sharply defined against the watch face, maintaining clear boundaries. The brightness levels are consistent, and there is no evidence of blurring or ghosting, suggesting precise digital rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all components of the watch—case, band, crown, and side button—proportionally aligned and structurally coherent without visible warping, stretching, or misplacement?",
    "explanation": "Each component of the watch, from the case to the band and including the crown and side button, appears well-aligned and proportionate. There is no visible warping, stretching, or misalignment in the structural elements, pointing to a high level of detail in the design process.",
    "answer": "Yes"
