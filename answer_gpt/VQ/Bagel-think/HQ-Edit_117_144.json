    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the golden scepter in the man's right hand have a smooth, reflective metallic surface that matches the lighting conditions without exhibiting unnatural texture artifacts or inconsistent highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scepter appears in a cartoon style, characterized by a consistent yellow-golden color without texture gradients or reflective shine. The surface is flat and does not match realistic lighting conditions, indicative of a simplified illustration. Thus, the surface does not exhibit a smooth, reflective metallic quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pastel-colored fabrics of the man’s coat, vest, trousers, and shirt rendered with visible texture and depth, maintaining natural folds and shadows without appearing flat or washed out?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing is depicted in a simplified cartoon or illustrative style. The pastel colors are solid and lack visible texture, shading, or depth typically created by natural folds and shadows, leading to a flat appearance rather than realistic rendering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cobblestones beneath the man’s feet form a continuous, evenly spaced pattern with natural irregularities and consistent shading, avoiding broken or misaligned stones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cobblestones appear regularly patterned and evenly spaced in a simple illustration style. There is no visible shading or irregularity in the stones, suggesting a cartoon representation where focus on intricate detail and shading is minimal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the detachable note sections placed along the outer edges of the image without overlapping the man or background architecture, and do they have clean, uniform borders resembling paper cutouts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The detachable note sections in Image B are positioned along the edges and do not overlap with the man or background architecture. They have clean, uniform borders with a consistent appearance akin to paper cutouts, aligning with a typical design layout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the man’s right hand gripping the scepter show five clearly defined fingers with natural joint angles and no deformation, while the left hand in the pocket maintains a relaxed, anatomically accurate pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man’s right hand is shown gripping the scepter, but in a simplified cartoon style without distinct, articulated fingers or joint angles, reflecting a common illustrative abstraction. The left hand is placed in the pocket with no visible anatomical detail to judge accuracy.",
