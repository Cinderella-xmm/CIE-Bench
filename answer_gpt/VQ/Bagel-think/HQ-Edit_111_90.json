      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the metal filigree patterns and gemstone placements on the transformed necklace clearly defined and free from geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the necklace's filigree patterns are intricate and detailed, with a consistent symmetry and proportion that suggests careful design. The gemstones are integrated into the design, maintaining their clarity and shape, free from any obvious distortion. This suggests that the craftsmanship in the edited image was maintained to a high standard, leading to the rational conclusion that there are no visible distortions in the design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the snake tail maintain its original scaly texture and smooth curvature as it emerges from the mossy bank without sudden breaks or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snake tail is carefully integrated into the scene, showing a consistent texture across its surface with visible scales. The curvature appears natural without abrupt interruptions or awkward angles. This indicates that the snake tail was altered with attention to preserving its realistic appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass dome visually transparent with consistent reflections and refractions across its surface, showing no jagged edges or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome displays a smooth surface, visible transparency, and consistent lighting that generates natural reflections and refractions. There are no evident jagged edges or digital artifacts present. This suggests that the dome was rendered well to convey a realistic glass appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the emerald pond display natural water surface details such as subtle ripples and reflections, and are the silver leaves evenly shaped with consistent metallic highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the emerald pond has visible ripples that enhance its realism, and reflections that contribute to its depth. The silver leaves are uniformly shaped, with metallic highlights that suggest light interaction appropriately. These consistent details indicate the edited image captures these natural elements effectively.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the ornate branches supporting the chandelier proportionally sized and shaped to resemble natural plant structures without angular breaks or unnatural joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branches supporting the chandelier are artistically crafted and resemble natural plant formations. The proportions appear balanced and the joints are smooth without angular disruptions. This suggests the branches were designed to fit seamlessly into the overall aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the new elements (pond, leaves, branches, dome) properly overlap and interact with the original necklace and snake tail without floating disjointedly or violating depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the new elements are integrated in a way that respects the spatial context of the scene. Everything seems to overlap and interact coherently, maintaining depth perception, which is crucial for achieving a believable composition. This indicates careful attention to the placement and interaction of these elements with the original ones.",
