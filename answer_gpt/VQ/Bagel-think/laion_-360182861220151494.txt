    "Question": "Q1: Are the character’s eyes in Panel 1 clearly narrowed and intense, with visible tension in the eyelids and pupils, and is the hand gripping the katana properly aligned with five distinct fingers showing natural curvature?",
    "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the character's expression is intended to convey intensity and focus. However, the eyes do not show clear narrowing or visible tension, as the expression appears more neutral or relaxed. The hand gripping the katana should ideally show natural finger curvature. Upon examining the image, while the grip is reasonable, the distinction of individual fingers could be clearer. The pose and hand positioning do not fully establish the intended intensity or tension in the character's demeanor.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the character’s leaping pose in Panel 2 show correct leg extension and arm positioning consistent with forward momentum, and do the fiery trails originate naturally from the hair strands without overlapping into solid parts of the body?",
    "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the character is depicted in a dynamic pose seemingly suggestive of leaping or action. The leg extension and arm positioning contribute appropriately to the perception of movement, suggesting forward momentum. The fiery trails, which are meant to simulate energy extensions from the hair, generally emanate naturally from the hair strands and do not visibly overlap into or disrupt solid parts of the body. This maintains the coherence of the action pose and the surrounding effects.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the katana in Panel 3 correctly oriented forward without clipping through the character’s uniform or distorting the sleeve, and are the surrounding energy swirls continuous and free of pixelated or broken lines?",
    "explanation": "In Panel 3 of Image B, the katana is depicted as being oriented forward in an action pose. The correct alignment and lack of clipping through the character's uniform or any distortion of the sleeve contribute to a natural depiction of swordsmanship in motion. The surrounding energy swirls are continuous, flowing smoothly around the character without becoming pixelated or broken, enhancing the visual impact of the character’s action.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the backgrounds in all three panels retain their original vibrancy and contrast without color bleed into the character’s outline or loss of sharpness in the bold borders around her figure?",
    "explanation": "The backgrounds in all three panels of Image B maintain their vibrancy and contrast, with no obvious color bleed into the character’s outline, which helps keep the figure distinct against the backdrop. The sharpness of the bold borders around the character’s figure remains intact, contributing to clear outlines and maintaining focus on the character without distraction from the background.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the character’s head, torso, and limbs proportionally consistent across all three panels, with no stretching or compression that alters the original anatomy or causes misalignment between body parts?",
    "explanation": "The character's head, torso, and limbs appear proportionally consistent across all three panels in Image B. The character's anatomy does not exhibit stretching or compression, and there is no noticeable misalignment between the body parts, maintaining the characteristic style and physical coherence throughout the panels.",
    "answer": "Yes"
