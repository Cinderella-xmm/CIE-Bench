    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the orange lifebuoy still clearly visible as a circular object centered within the intended eye area, with white foamy textures extending outward like lashes without breaking the circle's outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lifebuoy has been edited to become part of a stylized eye on the creature. The shape of the lifebuoy remains circular but is now integrated into the design as an eye, with foamy textures serving as lashes. These lashes are not breaking the lifebuoy's circular outline, suggesting the lifebuoy is still discernible as a component of the eye.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the netting sections along the shoreline transformed into soft, undulating fin shapes with gradual transitions from mesh to organic form, lacking sharp angles or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the netting has been creatively edited to resemble parts of an organic, fin-like structure of the creature. The transformation from mesh to fin shape lacks sharp angles and appears to blend smoothly, indicating an organic form rather than a mechanical or pixelated structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shoreline curve smoothly into a continuous, rounded body shape with wave-like ridges embedded in the sand, without sudden kinks or flat regions disrupting the flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the originally straight shoreline is now modified into a continuous, rounded body of a creature that flows naturally with wave-like forms along its edge. There are no abrupt kinks or flat areas noted, providing the appearance of a fluid, single-piece body.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sea-green markings distributed evenly across the sandy surface with soft, diffused edges and no visible pixels, overlays, or repeating patterns that suggest artificial addition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sea-green markings on the creature's body do not exhibit any noticeable pixels or repeating artificial patterns, and they appear to be smoothly integrated with soft, diffused edges into the creature's (previously sandy) body, indicating a believable natural distribution.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the eye (lifebuoy), fins (netting), and body (shoreline) align in a way that suggests a single, cohesive organism with logical proportions and no floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed components — lifebuoy eye, netting fins, and shoreline body — are aligned in a logical arrangement that implies a single cohesive organism. The proportions are consistent, and no elements appear to be floating or misaligned, supporting the idea of a unified creature design.",
