    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brass finishes on the ship’s hull and superstructure smooth and consistent in texture, with no visible cracks, pixelation, or mismatched shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized miniature ship with brass finishes that appear smooth and consistent. The texture of the hull and superstructure demonstrates uniform shading without visible irregularities such as cracks or pixelation, characteristic of well-finished brass material. The lighting and material rendering are clear indicators of this uniform texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metal automatons have five fingers per hand, properly articulated limbs, and clothing that conforms to the body shape without unnatural wrinkles or floating fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metal automatons displayed are small figures, which appear to have simplified features typical in miniature representations. The fingers are not distinctly visible due to the limited size and detail; however, their limbs are properly articulated, and their clothing conforms to body shapes appropriately, without displaying unnatural wrinkles or signs of floating fabric.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass lantern clearly defined around the scene, with transparent sides, visible metal framing, and no overlapping or missing sections that break the enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass lantern enclosing the ship in Image B is clearly defined. The transparent sides allow for visibility into the scene, consistent with a glass enclosure. The metal framing is visible and supports the structure effectively, with no overlapping or missing glass sections that might break the continuity of the enclosure.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the steam clouds rendered with smooth gradients and soft edges, appearing to float naturally within the lantern without jagged borders or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam clouds in Image B are depicted with smooth gradients and gentle edges, mimicking the natural appearance of steam. Their rendering displays no jagged borders or color shifts, providing a realistic floating effect within the lantern.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the compasses and flags placed in logical positions relative to the ship and dock, with proper orientation and size that does not distort the spatial relationships between objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not appear to include compasses, but the flags on the miniature ship are placed logically relative to the structure of the vessel, ensuring proper orientation. The proportions and positions of the flags are coherent within the scene and do not distort spatial relationships, maintaining a balanced depiction of the miniature setting.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the rotating gears and mechanical components attached to the ship’s structure with visible supports, and do they follow the contours of the hull and deck without floating or intersecting incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gears and mechanical components in Image B are attached with visible supports that align correctly with the contours of the hull and deck. They are depicted as properly integrated parts of the ship's structure and do not appear to be floating or incorrectly intersecting with other elements, ensuring a coherent and believable display of mechanical intricacies.",
