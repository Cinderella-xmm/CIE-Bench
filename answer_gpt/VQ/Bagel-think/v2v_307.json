      "question": "Does the chibi-style representation of the bandage inside the packaging maintain structural coherence without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style bandage figurine is meant to represent a stylized and simplified version of a realistic bandage. The design of such figurines typically involves exaggeration or simplification for aesthetic purposes, but they must maintain structural coherence to be recognizable as the intended object. Here, the bandage has exaggerated features typical of chibi-style figures, such as a simplified texture and cartoon-like proportions, without any unnatural distortions detracting from its representation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fabric texture and adhesive surface of the realistic bandage outside the packaging depicted with high detail and free from artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a realistic bandage outside the packaging, depicted with a high level of detail. The fabric texture shows intricate details with no noticeable artifacts, and the adhesive surface appears natural and correctly proportioned. The photo has high resolution, accentuating these realistic elements without distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the packaging design, including the isometric perspective and the label \"HEALING ESSENTIALS,\" integrate naturally into the scene without disrupting visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging design features stylized text and imagery consistent with the chibi-style action figure packaging design. However, the label reads 'HEMET ANEALIVE,' rather than 'HEALING ESSENTIALS,' disrupting natural language expectations. The isometric perspective of the box is correctly rendered but the text's inaccuracy impacts visual credibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and placement of the chibi-style bandage within the packaging logically consistent with the realistic bandage outside, avoiding any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style bandage within the packaging is presented as a figurine modeled after the realistic bandage placed outside. The proportions are consistent, with the stylized representation reflecting the scale and shape of a typical bandage in chibi figure form. There is no evident distortion between the two representations, although they follow different styling conventions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the materials used for the packaging and the realistic bandage appear natural and consistent with their intended purpose, without any obvious unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both the packaging for a collectible figure and a realistic bandage. The materials used for the packaging appear as intended for toy boxes, with a typical cardboard look. The realistic bandage's fabric and adhesive also appear natural, suitable for its intended medical purpose. Both objects are free from unnatural artifacts.",
