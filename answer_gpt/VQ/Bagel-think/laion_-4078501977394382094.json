      "question": "Does the roof of the van in Panel 1 tilt upward at a plausible angle without distorting the side panels or creating visible seams or breaks in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a van with a roof that appears to have a well-integrated, slightly tilted design. The visual cues indicate that the side panels of the van are intact, with no visible seams or breaks, suggesting a natural and consistent structure, which implies that the roof angle is plausible. The continuity of lines and uniformity of the structure support this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cactus in Panel 2 transformed into a spout with continuous curves and matching texture, and does it cast a shadow consistent with the light source direction seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus is creatively modified to resemble a spout, maintaining natural curves and texture continuity with the rest of the scene. The shadow it casts aligns with the desert setting's lighting, which is consistently sourced from the top left, matching the shadows seen elsewhere in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the newly added plants around the oasis in Panel 3 rendered with the same level of detail and color harmony as the original cacti, and do they cast shadows that align with the scene’s lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B introduces new plants around the oasis, similar to the ones seen across the scene. These plants exhibit a uniform level of detail and blend well with the color palette of the desert landscape. Their shadows extend in the same direction, congruent with the prevailing light source direction observed in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the text bubbles in all three panels positioned so they do not overlap critical parts of the van or landscape, and do they use a font style and size that matches the handwritten \"Road Trip\" title?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text bubbles appear strategically positioned not to interfere with any significant elements of the van or landscape, allowing the viewer to appreciate all key visual features. However, the font appears different from the handwritten style of the 'Road Trip' title, indicating a lack of stylistic cohesion between the title and the text in the bubbles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the water splashes in Panel 3 show droplets with varied sizes and arcing paths, and do they appear to originate from the van’s side without floating unnaturally above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts water splashes originating from a cactus-spout, not from the van. These are shown with varied droplet sizes and arcs. Since they extend from the spout to the van area rather than from the van itself, there is a creative depiction here, which may appear unnatural if considering only the van-origin hypothesis.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the headlights in Panel 2 enlarged and brightened but still contained within the original housing, and do they retain their round shape without stretching or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headlights seem to maintain their design within the housing, keeping the classic round shape characteristic of the van's original design. They are effectively highlighted to appear more radiant without distorting, stretching, or clipping outside the glass housing, preserving the integrity of the design.",
