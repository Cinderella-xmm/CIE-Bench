      "question": "Does the chibi version of the scientist retain the white lab coat and light blue shirt without any unnatural distortions in shape or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi version of the scientist, as depicted in Image B, maintains the consistent look of a white lab coat and a light blue shirt in various poses. The elements appear smooth and appropriately styled for a chibi representation, which often simplifies and exaggerates features but maintains recognizable clothing attributes. World knowledge of chibi art style supports the appropriateness of this representation without unnatural distortions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scientist has short hair featured in a minimalistic chibi style, which naturally simplifies details while retaining identifiable features.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bright green background with hexagonal patterns in Image B complements the chibi style by providing a vibrant contrast that frames the scientist stickers. The geometric patterns are cohesive with the playful and simplified aesthetic typical of chibi artwork and add visual interest without causing disruption or artifacts.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
