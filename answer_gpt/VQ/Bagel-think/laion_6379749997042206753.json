      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the kernel wearing autumn attire maintain consistent size and texture with real corn kernels, and does the clothing appear seamlessly integrated without visible edges or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kernel is depicted with autumn attire, which is a stylized, cartoonish illustration rather than a realistic depiction. As such, the size and texture aren't intended to be a direct representation of real corn kernels. The clothing does not aim for seamless integration typical in realistic imagery, but rather complements the cartoon style, which is characterized by bold lines and playful composition.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the energy lines emanating from the popcorn pieces smooth and consistent with the direction of motion, and do they avoid intersecting or distorting the popcorn shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the energy lines around the popcorn are part of a stylized, cartoon effect intended to convey motion or emphasis. These lines are smooth and maintain an explosive energy appearance without directly intersecting or distorting the shapes of the popcorn, keeping within the context of a cartoon style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the popcorn piece with the explorer hat properly scaled and textured, and do the spices and pumpkin elements adjacent to it appear naturally positioned without overlapping distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The popcorn with the explorer hat in Image B is a cartoon rendering, so its scaling and texturing are stylized rather than realistic. The adjacent pumpkin-themed elements are positioned to fit the whimsical design, without visible distortion or overlap problems. The cartoon style does not aim for photorealism but favors exaggerated and playful proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the popcorn pieces entering the ceramic bowls follow a downward trajectory consistent with gravity, and do they remain within the bowl boundaries without appearing to float above or clip through the rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a whimsical illustration of popcorn with anthropomorphic qualities, and as such, the depiction of popcorn pieces entering bowls is not subject to realistic physics. They are not designed to demonstrate a gravitational trajectory, and they don't necessarily adhere to realistic boundaries like failing to clip through the rim. The focus is on artistic creativity rather than realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the added elements (such as hats, energy lines, and spices) consistent with the original orange-brown theme, and do they lack over-saturation or color bleeding at edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors used for elements like hats, energy lines, and spices are consistent with the cohesive orange-brown theme, aligning with the autumn and pumpkin spice idea. The colors appear vibrant yet controlled, with no evident oversaturation or bleeding, maintaining clarity in the cartoonish visual style.",
