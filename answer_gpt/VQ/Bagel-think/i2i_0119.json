      "question": "Does the keychain version of the character maintain the same proportions and colors as the original image, without any visible distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain reflects the same character design as seen in the original image (Image A), with similar body proportions and colors. The character maintains its recognizable form with no visible distortion. The textures of the keychain look smooth and consistent with how such items usually appear, lacking any unnatural textures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the keychain appear naturally placed on the desk with appropriate shadows and reflections, indicating a realistic interaction with the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in Image B is positioned on the desk with noticeable shadows cast beneath it, which align well with the lighting and surface texture. This gives the impression of a natural placement and realistic interaction with the desk, typical of physical objects placed on such surfaces.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the books and glasses placed next to the keychain rendered with realistic textures and a consistent level of detail, without any obvious artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, while the keychain is clear and realistic, there are no glasses; instead, other typical desk items like a pen and papers feature realistic textures. The book details appear consistent without distortion or distractions which align with typical tabletop setups, indicating realistic rendering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the keychain and its neighboring objects (books, glasses, desk) crisp and well-defined, with no signs of blending or breaking apart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the keychain and the surrounding items such as the book and pen are sharp and clearly defined. There is no evidence of blending or edge fragmentation, reflecting a high level of detail and focus typical of digital and realistic rendering.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the books and glasses exhibit proper orientation and placement on the desk, reflecting typical real-world scenarios where they would be found?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no glasses. However, the book and other items like the pen are placed in a realistic manner, with a usual orientation for objects coming across on a desk surface. This setup reflects a typical real-world scenario well.",
