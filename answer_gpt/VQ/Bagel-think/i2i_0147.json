      "question": "Does the melted cheese appear with a natural texture and color, without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the melted cheese on the hot dog has a smooth and glossy texture, typical of cheese that has just started to melt. The color is a natural yellowish-orange, consistent with common processed melting cheese. There are no visible artifacts like pixelation, distortion, or discoloration that would make the cheese look unnatural.",

      "question": "Are the fried onions positioned naturally on the hot dog, avoiding any distortion or breakage of geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the fried onions are scattered on the cheese surface with natural randomness. The pieces appear crisp with defined edges and no discernible distortion. They follow a natural pattern of placement as one would expect when manually sprinkled.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the melted cheese and fried onions blend seamlessly with the hot dog buns and sausages, preserving structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, both the melted cheese and fried onions integrate smoothly with the hot dog. The cheese drapes over the sausage without any abrupt edges, and the onions settle naturally without gaps between toppings or misalignment. This seamless blend ensures that the alteration does not disrupt the consistency and quality of the overall structure.",

      "question": "Are the details of the melted cheese and fried onions preserved without losing clarity or introducing blurry textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon evaluating Image B, the melted cheese retains a clear and consistent texture, showing a realistic melted form. The fried onions are crisp and sharp, with individual pieces clearly visible and free from blurriness. The details of both elements are preserved well, implying careful editing without introducing visually distracting textures.",

      "question": "Does the barbecue tong look naturally placed near the grill, maintaining its structural integrity and proportion with the rest of the image elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the barbecue tong is positioned above the grill in a natural manner, appearing as if it is being used to adjust or place one of the hot dogs. The tongs are proportionate in size relative to the hot dogs and the grill, consistent with real-life scale and alignment. The tines and handle of the tongs look structurally intact without distortion.",
