      "question": "Does the addition of the text “Master Chef” and “Final Round” appear naturally integrated without disrupting the overall visual balance of the plate and spoon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it appears there is a logo with some text elements, but the words 'Master Chef' and 'Final Round' are not explicitly visible or legible. Instead, there's a design with a hat and flames, and the text reads something different, most likely related to a different theme. The logo is centrally positioned in the circle shape of the logo, but because it has a mix of elements and colors, it is not integrated directly with the simplicity of the spoon and plate idea like in the first image. Therefore, it does somewhat disrupt the original visual balance that a plain plate with a spoon might have had.",

      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts or unnatural textures introduced in the image due to the text overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo design and text do not feature any visible artifacts or unnatural textures. The design is visually clear, with its elements (text, tool, etc.) appearing to be intentionally integrated. There is no indication of any text artifacts like those that might appear if text were hastily added over an image without attention to blending or detail.",

      "question": "Do the text sizes for “Master Chef” and “Final Round” seem proportional and appropriate compared to the scale of the plate and spoon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no explicit text elements reading 'Master Chef' or 'Final Round'. Instead, the existing text is part of a logo design that takes up the entire space, making the proportional comparison to a plain plate and spoon ineffective as the elements considered are different. The main text in the logo is highly prominent, suggesting that any text on a hypothetical plate would be quite oversized in comparison to a potential plain plate and spoon image.",

      "question": "Does the font style chosen for “Master Chef” and “Final Round” complement the simplicity of the white plate and silver spoon, maintaining visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The font style actually present in Image B related to a different logo theme incorporating bold, modern typography, which stands out significantly more than a simple design would—like a spoon on a plate. This font style is quite vibrant and eye-catching, possibly deterring from a simplistic and calm presentation. It is more aligned with attracting attention, not necessarily simplicity or minimalism that is seen with a white plate and spoon.",

      "question": "Has the circular shape of the plate remained intact and undistorted despite the addition of the text elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image B is composed of a circular logo, though it doesn't feature a plate but rather a graphic element. The circular logo itself is well structured and maintains its shape without any visible distortion. Thus, if we assume hypothetically that Image A was altered to include text while keeping its plate form, then the assumption would be that the design maintains its boundary integrity.",
