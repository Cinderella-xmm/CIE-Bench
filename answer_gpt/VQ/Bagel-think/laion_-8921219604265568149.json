      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cathedral façade maintain detailed textures and depth consistent with the original stone structure, or does it appear uniformly smooth and plastic-like due to the resin material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral façade appears to lack the intricate stone textures and details seen in stone structures. The surface looks uniformly smooth and plastic-like, a characteristic feature of resin material used in models. By combining the visual analysis with the understanding that resin is typically used for creating smooth model surfaces, we conclude that the texture is not consistent with the detailed stone texture seen in real architecture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added miniature figures proportionally scaled and positioned so they appear naturally smaller than the cathedral and surrounding buildings without appearing stretched, flattened, or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature figures are added to scale with the resin model of the cathedral, appearing small and appropriately proportioned relative to the cathedral. Their placement around the base gives a natural sense of scale. By analyzing the figures and understanding scale modeling, the positioning and proportions look consistent, which does not give any impression of being stretched or misaligned.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the miniature lamps emit soft, localized light that appears consistent with their size and placement, without creating unrealistic glows or illuminating areas that should remain in shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature lamps are present but do not show evidence of emitting light within the constraints of a model display. Given the nature of miniature lamps in models, any glow would be soft and unobtrusive, yet within this image, there is no visible indication of light emission affecting surrounding areas, ensuring realism in lighting effects.",

      "question": "Is the display case fully integrated around the cathedral and square with clean, continuous edges and no intersecting or fragmented parts that disrupt the geometry of the original structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cathedral within a display case, which is designed to neatly encompass the model without disrupting their geometry. The edges of the case are clean and continuous around the cathedral model. Analyzing this along with knowledge that display cases aim for seamless integration confirms the absence of intersecting or fragmented parts.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the engraved plaque clearly visible, properly aligned, and styled with appropriate depth and lettering that matches the baroque aesthetic without appearing flat or digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the engraved plaque is prominently displayed at the base of the model. The plaque features depth and clear lettering that aligns with the style of the model's aesthetic. Analyzing the plaque's visual detail and alignment, there is no indication of flatness or digital pasting, suggesting authenticity in the engraving.",
