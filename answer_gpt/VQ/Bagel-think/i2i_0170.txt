    "Question": "Q1: Are the clothing and bags of both women depicted with soft gradient blocks that retain their original shapes and proportions without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
    "Explanation": "In Image B, the clothing and bags of both women are represented through clear and precise line drawings, maintaining their original shapes and proportions. The drawing style shows well-defined lines without introducing artifacts that alter the appearance of these elements. Thus, despite being stylized differently, they retain their essence in terms of shape.",
    "Answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the mannequins and their outfits inside the store window appear structurally coherent and visually plausible in terms of shape and material after the style conversion, without any noticeable distortion or unnatural textures?",
    "Explanation": "In Image B, the mannequins and their outfits maintain their structure and detailed outlines as in a simplified sketch. The line drawing style effectively captures the mannequin posture and outlines, even though it lacks texture detail, ensuring the shapes remain coherent and plausible.",
    "Answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the texture of the cobblestone pavement represented naturally with soft gradients, maintaining the structural integrity and visual coherence without any loss of detail or unnatural appearance?",
    "Explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the cobblestone pavement is simplified into line drawings. While the detail level reduces due to the drawing style, the pattern retains the structural integrity and basic form, ensuring the overall visual coherence.",
    "Answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the lighting effects and shadows in the image convincingly portrayed with soft gradient blocks, ensuring they contribute to the overall realism and natural appearance without breaking the visual flow?",
    "Explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of lighting effects and shadows as the image employs a solid line drawing style. This style transformation omits any gradient blocks that would typically represent natural lighting and shadows, potentially impacting the overall realism connected with dimensionality.",
    "Answer": "No"
