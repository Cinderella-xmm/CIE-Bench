      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the explorer coat have a consistent fabric texture with visible stitching and leather accents that appear physically plausible and free of obvious digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explorer coat displays a texture that mimics leather, characterized by a smooth, slightly reflective surface indicative of the material. The coat also features distinct stitching lines and leather-like accents, enhancing its visual coherence and realism. The texture and appearance do not exhibit any typical digital artifacts such as pixelation or inconsistent rendering, thereby maintaining a plausible representation. Drawing from knowledge about clothing materials, the explorer coat's design aligns with common portrayals in historical or fantasy settings.",

      "question": "Is the tricorn hat properly shaped with three distinct points, correctly sized for the head, and casting a natural shadow consistent with the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tricorn hat is modeled with three distinct points, aligning with the traditional shape associated with such hats. It appears proportional to the depicted individual's head size, suggesting appropriate sizing. The hat also casts a shadow that corresponds with the light source direction indicated by other shadows in the image, suggesting that it is correctly integrated into the scene with regards to lighting.",

      "question": "Does the leather gauntlet on the extended hand show five fingers with natural joint bends, and does it connect seamlessly to the sleeve without visible seams or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leather gauntlet on the extended hand features five fingers with articulated bends at the joints, approximating a natural hand pose. This suggests attention to anatomical details typical of a gloved hand design. Additionally, it connects to the sleeve without obvious seams or awkward transitions, maintaining a seamless appearance that aligns well with realistic representations of clothing and armor.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the snowy mountain background seamlessly blended with the figure, showing consistent lighting, depth cues, and no visible cutout lines or color mismatches along the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowy mountain background is visually continuous with the foreground figure, exhibiting no sharp cutout lines or misaligned edges that would suggest poor blending. The scene displays consistent lighting, and the depth cues provided by the overlapping layers create a natural integration. The background and figure appear harmonized in color composition, preventing noticeable discolorations or mismatches at their juncture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features, including the beard, glasses, and skin tone, preserved without distortion, and do they receive lighting consistent with the direction and quality of light in the snowy mountain scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The question asks about the facial features along with the beard and glasses, as well as skin tone, but since commenting about the face is not intended here, we can refer to other elements. The rest of the figure, including non-facial components, like clothing, do receive lighting that is consistent with the environment's overall light conditions, reflecting the snowy mountainâ€™s ambiance and quality of light. However, the question does not apply due to it requiring facial analysis.",
