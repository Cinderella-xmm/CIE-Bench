    "Question": "Q1: Do the facial features on each suitcase align naturally with the object’s shape without distorting its geometry or creating unnatural protrusions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no facial features present on any of the suitcases. Each suitcase has a smooth surface, and there are no modifications or additions of face-like elements. Given this information, there are no distortions or unnatural protrusions because the suitcases maintain their original form. Additionally, no visible facial features are integrated into the suitcase designs, which would typically require careful alignment to avoid distortion.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the world map backdrop properly aligned with the scene’s perspective and does it integrate seamlessly without warping or clipping?",
    "explanation": "The backdrop depicted is a flat world map integrated into the scene beside the figures and objects. Its alignment follows the perspective, fitting comfortably without warping or clipping. The integration seems seamless and the map’s flat surface supports its proper alignment with the scene orientation. Perspective considerations reflect a balanced and appropriately scaled setting.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the display case fully enclosing the scene with correct proportions, no clipping of elements, and realistic glass transparency or reflections?",
    "explanation": "There is no visible display case enclosing the scene in the edited image (Image B). The objects and figures are situated in an open space without any sign of enclosure. Without the presence of a case, there aren't concerns regarding clipping, proportions, or the transparency and reflection of glass.",
