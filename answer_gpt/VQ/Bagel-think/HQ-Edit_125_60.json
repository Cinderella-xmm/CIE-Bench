    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the engraved patterns on the transformed tagine's surface smooth and continuous, without visible artifacts such as broken lines, abrupt color shifts, or unnatural texture blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tagine's surface displays intricate engraved patterns that are ornate and continuous. The engravings show fine detailing with no visible artifacts like broken lines or abrupt color shifts. The texture appears naturally blended without any noticeable disruption, indicating a smooth transition across patterns. This observation confirms the quality and continuity of the decorative elements on the transformed tagine.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the extended spout emerge seamlessly from the top of the tagine, maintaining consistent curvature and structural continuity without any visible gaps, warping, or disproportionate scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The extended spout in Image B appears to flow naturally from the top of the tagine. It has a smooth curvature, consistent with its design, and there are no visible gaps or distortions in its structure. The spout's scale is proportionate relative to the rest of the tagine, suggesting seamless integration and maintaining structural integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the smoke beneath the tagine rendered with soft diffusion and layered opacity, showing realistic lighting effects and no sharp outlines or blocky textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smoke emanating from beneath the tagine in Image B has a softened, diffused appearance with layered opacity. The lighting effects on the smoke enhance its realism, and it is free from sharp outlines or blocky textures. These qualities contribute to a convincing and naturalistic representation of smoke.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the floating orbs derived from the original ingredients (such as lemon, lime, garlic) maintain recognizable shapes and emit a soft glow without visible rendering artifacts like haloing, misaligned highlights, or floating disconnected fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floating orbs in Image B exude a soft glow and maintain a smooth, rounded shape, akin to luminous spheres, which might represent transformed elements of the original ingredients. They lack any rendering artifacts such as haloing or misaligned highlights and do not have floating disconnected fragments, allowing them to appear cohesive and well-rendered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the materials of the transformed tagine (ceramic body, engraved surface) and surrounding elements (floating orbs, smoke) visually consistent with their expected physical properties, without unnatural sheen, flat shading, or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed tagine and its elements exhibit expected physical properties. The ceramic body shows finely-detailed engravings with realistic highlights and shadows, devoid of unnatural sheen or flat shading. The floating orbs and smoke demonstrate appropriate glow and diffusion, respectively, both upholding fine detail and physical consistency without any noticeable visual discrepancy.",
