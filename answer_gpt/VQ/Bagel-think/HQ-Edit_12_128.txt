    "Question": "Q1: Does the frosted crystal frame preserve the original carved details (such as the floral crest and side columns) without warping or flattening the shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the frame's design seems to retain elaborate details such as the floral crest and side columns, but they are rendered in crystal instead of wood. The shapes appear consistent and true to the original structure's form, and the crystal material allows for a high level of detail without visible warping or flattening. This is indicative of preserving the original carved details in the transformation from wood to crystal.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the Roman numerals etched into the crystal face evenly spaced, legible, and aligned with the original hour positions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Roman numerals on the clock face appear to be evenly spaced and legible, similar to how they should be arranged in a standard clock. They are aligned with the general positions where hour markers belong, consistent with clock design, which suggests that the etching process has maintained alignment and clarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the faceted crystal pendulum symmetrically shaped, properly suspended by the chains, and free from floating or misaligned connections?",
    "explanation": "The pendulum in Image B has a symmetrical faceted design and is visibly attached to the chains in a way that appears centered and accurate. There are no signs of it floating or being misaligned, indicating it is properly suspended, respecting the mechanics of how a pendulum should function.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the white marble wall uniformly textured, free from visible stitching or artificial boundaries, and does it cast soft, natural shadows beneath the clock?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B shows a white marble wall with a consistent texture across the surface. There are no visible stitching lines or artificial boundaries present. The shadows cast by the clock appear soft and natural, enhancing the realistic interaction of the clock with its background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the crystal components (frame, face, pendulum) visually integrated without noticeable gaps, material inconsistencies, or unnatural reflections at their junctions?",
    "explanation": "All crystal components in Image B appear to flow together seamlessly, with no visible gaps or material inconsistencies at their junctions. The reflections on the crystal surfaces appear consistent with expectations for a clear and polished material, emphasizing an integrated design with no unnatural artifacts or reflections.",
    "answer": "Yes"
