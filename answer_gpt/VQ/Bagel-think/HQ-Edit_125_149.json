      "question": "Do the vertical towers now resemble tree limbs with natural bark texture and leaf coverage, without visible seams or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge structure has been significantly altered. The vertical towers of what was initially an industrial bridge now resemble an animated creature. Instead of resembling tree limbs with natural bark and leaf coverage, these towers are part of a fantastical moss-covered structure that forms the limbs of a creature-like figure. There are noticeable geometric distortions since they resemble legs rather than tree trunks, and they do not exhibit a traditional tree bark texture or seamless natural integration into the environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arches now formed into a continuous ribcage structure with natural curvature and spacing, free from broken or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no noticeable arches in the traditional sense that have been transformed into a ribcage structure. The horizontal elements of the bridge are obscured as part of the composition of the fantastical creature. Since no ribcage structure is visible or implied in the design of this creature's limbs, we cannot affirm the presence of a naturally curved ribcage.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the suspension cables been replaced with vine-like tendrils that show natural growth patterns, such as twisting or clinging, and do they blend with the forest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original suspension cables of the bridge remain unchanged, as they retain their linear and metallic structure. They do not exhibit characteristics akin to vine-like tendrils, which would typically show a more organic growth pattern with twists or natural clinging characteristics that blend into a forest environment. The cables in the edited image still appear as constructed elements rather than natural ones.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bridgeâ€™s foundations now consist of moss-covered roots extending into the stream, with natural branching and tapering, rather than solid stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foundations of the bridge structure have not been transformed into moss-covered roots. The bases of the bridge appear solid and consistent with man-made materials, much like in Image A. There are no features that resemble natural branching or tapering that one would associate with roots merging into a stream environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a bark-textured head structure with two glowing emerald eyes positioned at the top of the bridge, with the glow confined and not causing light bleed or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a creature-like head is present at the top of the bridge. This head is designed with a texture similar to moss or bark and features two prominently glowing emerald eyes. The glow from these eyes is well-defined and does not spill over excessively into the surrounding area. It creates an intense but confined light that does not produce unnatural highlights on nearby structures.",
