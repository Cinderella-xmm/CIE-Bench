      "question": "Does the themed box appear to have a natural industrial aesthetic without any visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The themed box shown in Image B has a consistent industrial aesthetic as typically expected from a storage container for bearings. There are no visible unnatural textures or distracting artifacts on the box surface, which supports its natural appearance. This is judged based on the smoothness and simple geometric design typical of such boxes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and angles of the themed box in isometric perspective consistent and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the themed box is presented in a manner that visually follows an isometric perspective, where elements like proportions, angles, and parallel lines meet the characteristics of traditional isometric drawings. The lines do not converge and remain consistent, indicating no distortion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bearings and components inside the box retain their fine details and appear precise without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bearings within the themed box in Image B maintain their detailed metallic surfaces and inner structures that bearings are known for. This includes visible grooves and polished surfaces, indicating there is no obvious loss of detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the metallic texture and intricate design of the primary bearing outside the box rendered photorealistically without any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The primary bearing outside the box in Image B possesses a metallic sheen and intricate design details typical of high-quality bearings. The textures appear natural and without digital artifacts, which achieves a photorealistic look. This is determined by the visible reflection, sheen, and expected surface quality common to metal objects.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bearings and components arranged in an organized manner both inside and outside the box, contributing to visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of bearings inside the box in Image B is methodical and orderly, each nestled within its own section, which matches the usual commercial presentation for industrial components. Similarly, bearings outside the box are placed in a logical, non-chaotic layout, supporting visual credibility through organization.",
