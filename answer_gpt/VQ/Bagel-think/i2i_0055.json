      "question": "Does the cartoon transformation of the baby elephant maintain natural proportions without any noticeable distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon baby elephant is depicted with proportions that are typical of a cute, simplified style. The head is notably large compared to the body, which is a common stylistic choice in cartoons and not considered distortion. There are no unnatural textures present; the lines are smooth, and the fill is plain, which is common for cartoon illustrations.",

      "question": "Is the text \"First Splash!\" and \"Ele-Baby\" displayed with proper transparency, without obstructing underlying details or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The actual text reads 'Finst EleBay!' rather than 'First Splash!' and 'Ele-Baby'. The text in Image B is solid and does not use transparency, meaning there is no obstruction or introduction of artifacts that transparency might cause. The text stands out clearly against the background.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon baby elephant is drawn with a coherent pose typical for such a stylized depiction. It maintains structural integrity, with details like the trunk, ears, and legs positioned in a manner that seems natural for a cartoon elephant, even though the proportions are exaggerated for stylistic effect.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B ('Finst EleBay!') is positioned around the elephant, aligning with the edges of the design in a way that complements the visual layout. The text is bold and legible, and although it's not directly transparent, it integrates well with the cartoon graphic without visual disruption.",
