    "Question": "Q1: Does the stone-like texture applied to the mountain's surface exhibit uniformity and natural variation in roughness, without visible artifacts like repeating patterns or abrupt transitions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain appears to have a stone-like texture applied to its surface. This texture gives it a rough, granular appearance, which should ideally look consistent with the natural variation found in real rocky surfaces. A good texture application avoids visible artifacts such as repeating patterns or abrupt transitions that would break the illusion of a natural structure. The texture in Image B does not exhibit such artifacts, appearing uniform throughout with natural variation, making it look convincing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the rock-carved eyes positioned symmetrically and proportionally on the mountain’s peak, with realistic depth and integration into the terrain, avoiding floating or misplaced features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain has eyes carved into it, characterized by a glowing appearance. For such features to appear convincing, they need to be placed symmetrically and proportionally on the peak. They should appear integrated into the surface, rather than floating or looking artificially placed. In this image, the eyes appear well-positioned and integrated, giving a believable depth as though actually carved into the rock.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the wing-like ridges extend from the mountain’s sides in a way that follows natural geological lines and does not introduce sharp, broken, or impossible angles?",
    "explanation": "The edited Image B shows the mountain with wing-like ridges extending from its sides. For realism, these ridges should follow the natural lines of the geological structure, without creating sharp or impossible angles. However, in Image B, the ridges appear to jut out in a way that does not conform to natural geological formations, giving them a fantastical rather than a realistic appearance.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the limbs of the creature integrated with the tree silhouettes in a way that avoids visual conflicts such as overlapping branches appearing behind solid limbs or disconnected joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's limbs should integrate seamlessly with the tree silhouettes. This means avoiding any visual conflicts like branches appearing to cut through the limbs or joints looking disconnected. The image does show some overlap between the creature's form and the tree silhouettes, but it manages this without significant visual conflicts. The limbs appear to be positioned behind the tree branches in a coherent manner.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the luminous veins emit a soft glow that blends with the blue and pink hues of the sky, without creating bright halos, sharp edges, or overexposed areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the luminous veins are a distinctive feature that should emit a glow blending naturally with the environment. These veins emit a purple glow that integrates well with the natural colors of the sky, avoiding overly bright halos or sharp edges. The luminous effect is soft, enhancing the image's aesthetic without causing overexposure or stark contrast with the sky.",
    "answer": "Yes"
