      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the hammer's handle display a uniform deep blue enamel surface with no visible cracks, rough patches, or color variations, and does the head show realistic metallic sheen with consistent reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer's handle has been edited to feature a deep blue enamel, and upon close examination, it indeed appears uniform without visible cracks or rough patches. The color consistency is maintained throughout the handle. The hammer's head shows a metallic sheen, with consistent reflections that suggest realism. Considering these observations with the expectation for enamel consistency and metallic luster, the hammer's appearance aligns with the description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the chisel, file, wrench, and pliers retain their original shapes and proportions, with smooth, reflective enamel surfaces and no warped edges, missing details, or inconsistent material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chisel, file, wrench, and pliers are examined for shape and surface characteristics. Each tool retains a realistic form akin to actual tools, with no visible warping or loss of essential details. The enamel surface appears smooth and reflective, supporting the notion of care in textural editing. When compared to potential distortion or material inconsistency, these tools maintain coherent transitions in material, meeting the stated criteria.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the enamel shavings shaped into natural-looking curls with varied thickness and smooth, glossy surfaces, avoiding flat or rigid appearances and maintaining fine detail along the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The enamel shavings in Image B are inspected for naturalistic qualities. These shavings are depicted with curls and variations in thickness, resembling real wood shavings, though made of enamel. They appear smooth and glossy, capturing light in a manner that avoids a flat or rigid appearance. The edges hold detailed contours, which prevent a simplistic look, reflecting the delicacy of actual shavings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the linen fabric background show a natural weave texture with soft folds and slight color variation, and does it provide a visually coherent base for the enamel tools without appearing artificial or overly smooth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a linen fabric with visible weave texture, providing a realistic appearance. It features minor folds and subtle color variations that contribute to a natural presentation, acting as a coherent platform for the enamel tools. These characteristics, indicative of actual linen, avoid an artificial or overly smooth depiction.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows and highlights on the enamel tools consistent with a single light source and the reflective nature of enamel, and do all tools rest naturally on the fabric without gaps, floating effects, or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, shadows and highlights on the enamel tools suggest a single light source, reflecting the shiny nature typical of enamel. The illumination is consistent with a directionality indicating where light hits and shadows form. Each tool appears to rest convincingly on the fabric, without gaps, floating visuals, or misalignment, ensuring a logical physical relationship between the objects and the background.",
