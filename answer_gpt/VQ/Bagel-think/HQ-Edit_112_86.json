      "question": "Does the main body of the teapot appear as clear glass with visible internal reflections and refractions consistent with transparent material, without any opaque or metallic residue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main body of the teapot is presented as transparent glass. There are visible internal reflections and refractions, which are characteristic of transparent glass materials. There is no evidence of opaque or metallic residue on the teapot's body, as it showcases a clear glass appearance. This conclusion is reached through the observation of the transparency and clarity of the material.",

      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the glass surface uniformly frosted with no signs of smudging, uneven opacity, or artificial texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns on the teapot in Image B appear uniformly frosted. The textures are consistent, without evident smudging, uneven opacity, or any artificial texture artifacts. The patterns maintain a clear and crisp appearance which indicates uniform frosting. This judgment is based on the consistent coloration and sharpness of the floral details.",

      "question": "Do the handle and spout exhibit a consistent amber tint with smooth gradients and sharp boundaries, without color fringing or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle and spout of the teapot display a consistent amber tint. The transitions of color are smooth, displaying gradients without disruptive fringing or unnatural highlights. The boundaries of the tint are sharp and clearly defined, supporting the observation of a well-executed gradient effect. This is derived from analyzing the color consistency and smoothness along the surfaces of the handle and spout.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the reflection under the teapot symmetrical, sharp, and correctly aligned with the object’s base, showing accurate contours and transparency effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection of the teapot in Image B is symmetrical, sharply defined, and correctly aligned with the object's base. It accurately mirrors the contours and transparency effects observed in the body of the teapot. The reflection is clear with no observable distortions, indicating precise alignment and symmetry. The conclusion is drawn by evaluating how the reflection mirrors the teapot’s design elements accurately.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the lid, spout, handle, and body preserved such that there are no stretched, compressed, or misaligned sections compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the teapot’s lid, spout, handle, and body are consistently preserved. There is no discernible stretching, compression, or misalignment in comparison to the original teapot in Image A. This preservation is evidenced by the consistent shape and size relative to each other, similar to the original design. The comparison reveals no distortion, confirming the integrity of the proportions.",
