      "question": "Does the gold spoon maintain the same structural coherence as the original fork with no unnatural texture or distortion in the handle and bowl area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold spoon in Image B shows a smooth structure with a coherent shape typical of a spoon. The handle has intricate engravings, which are well-defined and consistent with normal design patterns seen on decorative spoons. The bowl of the spoon appears symmetric and smoothly transitions into the handle without any noticeable distortions. Comparing this with the original fork in Image A, which is a more straightforward, simpler design, the spoon maintains artistic coherence without any unnatural distortions. This suggests that the spoon's structure is harmonious and consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the interaction between the gold spoon and the napkin appear natural without disrupting the napkin’s texture or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold spoon is placed on a blue napkin. The interaction seems natural, as the spoon sits lightly atop the fabric without any unnatural overlap or disruption in the napkin’s texture. The shadows and folds of the napkin appear consistent, not altered by the presence of the spoon. This suggests a natural placement and interaction, similar to the placement of the fork in Image A. The effect is realistic, suggesting no warping or tension in the fabric caused by the added object.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the patterns on the gold spoon integrate naturally with the scene and appear as part of the spoon rather than a separate overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns on the gold spoon's handle in Image B are intricate and well-defined, appearing as if they are embossed into the metal itself. The engravings align naturally with the spoon's form, blending seamlessly. The lighting and shadows on the patterns also correspond realistically to the rest of the spoon, indicating they are inherent to the spoon's design rather than a later addition. This integration is akin to how the fork's simpler design integrates without inconsistencies in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the gold spoon exhibit realistic reflectivity and shine consistent with a metallic spoon under the lighting conditions of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold spoon displays a realistic metallic shine, with highlights and reflections consistent with smooth, polished gold surfaces. The lighting plays naturally on the surface, consistently casting glints and shadows that suggest metallic material akin to a reflective spoon. This is similar to the reflective surface of the fork in Image A, which showed a silver sheen. The shine reflects the ambient light naturally, supporting the realism of the material.",

      "question": "Is the size and positioning of the gold spoon proportionate and physically logical in relation to the napkin, avoiding any unusual scaling issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold spoon in Image B is proportionately sized to fit the napkin it rests upon. Its length aligns well with the dimensions of the napkin, similar to the placement of the fork in Image A. The spoon's bowl and handle fall naturally within the folds and edges of the napkin, avoiding any strange scaling or position that would suggest discrepancies. Thus, the proportionality and positioning appear logical and physically feasible.",
