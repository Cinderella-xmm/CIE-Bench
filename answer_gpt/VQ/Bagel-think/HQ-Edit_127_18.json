      "question": "Are the boundaries of the vintage travel case visible and seamlessly integrated into the scene without sudden shifts in perspective or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vintage travel case is clearly visible, and its boundaries are well-defined. The case is situated as part of a diorama scene, and while it showcases various objects like the elephant and the miniature acacia tree, the integration is achieved through the enclosed space of the case itself rather than through seamless integration with the external environment. The lighting and perspective shifts are contained within the case, not indicating real-world integration. Hence, the case's boundaries are visible, and perspective shifts are consistent with the diorama. Therefore, it does not fully integrate into a larger scene, but remains separate within its own context.",

      "question": "Does the textured resin grass show individual blades with natural variation in length and angle, and does it cast soft shadows consistent with the light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the resin grass appears uniform with a consistent surface texture rather than individual blades showing variation in length and angle. The grass is depicted in a carefully manicured shape, typical of how models are crafted. Shadows cast beneath show some softness but do not depict naturally varying shadows for individual blades due to the uniformity of the grass. Therefore, the grass does not exhibit natural variation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the miniature acacia tree significantly smaller than the elephant and placed at a distance that creates a believable sense of scale within the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature acacia tree is notably smaller in comparison to the elephant, which aligns with the aim to create a believable diorama. The tree's placement and size within the case help establish a deliberate scale model intended to simulate a landscape scene in miniature form, thus effectively conveying a realistic sense of scale within the confines of the diorama.",

      "question": "Are the painted clouds located on the inner surface of the lid, showing no specular highlights or depth inconsistencies that would suggest they are floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painted clouds are visibly attached to the inner surface of the lid of the travel case. They exhibit uniformity and flatness, typical of painted objects on a solid surface. There are no depth inconsistencies or specular highlights that would suggest these clouds are floating freely within the diorama. This depiction clearly marks them as part of the case's backdrop, rather than standalone elements with their own depth and volume.",

      "question": "Is the brass compass resting flat on the base with a clear reflection and shadow that matches the lighting direction and surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass compass is positioned on the base within the diorama case. The compass doesn't showcase visible reflections but casts a shadow aligned with other elements in the scene. While reflections are minimal due to the angle and lighting setup in the photograph, the shadow is consistent with a top-down light source, indicating alignment with surface textures and lighting direction.",

      "question": "Does the elephant retain natural skin texture, correct limb proportions, and intact tusk curvature without any visible deformation or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant model within the diorama features a realistic texture on its skin, displaying intricate detailing typical of model representations. Limb proportions are maintained without visible deformation, and the tusks retain natural curvature without pixelation effects. The elephant model is crafted to represent real-world anatomical details convincingly, consistent with its miniature presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all objects in the diorama cast shadows in the same direction and with similar softness, consistent with a single light source from above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast by objects like the elephant, acacia tree, and compass within the diorama appear to fall in a uniform direction. This suggests a consistent light source placed above the scene. The softness of shadows is similar across the objects, reinforcing the idea of a single coherent lighting environment. Such setup is typical for shadow casting in controlled diorama settings.",
