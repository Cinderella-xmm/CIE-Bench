      "question": "Do the chibi-fied players maintain a natural appearance without introducing unnatural textures or artefacts that disrupt the scene's overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features chibi-style cartoon characters in a pastoral setting. The chibi-fied characters have clear outlines and consistent styling typical of this art style, with no visible artefacts or unnatural textures. The visual presentation is intentional and consistent with cartoon aesthetics, thus not disrupting the scene's authenticity as a cartoon depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the outfits and hairstyles of the chibi-fied players proportionally and physically rational, avoiding any distortion that conflicts with the natural appearance of the players?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-fied players in Image B are depicted in a stylized manner, characteristic of the chibi art form, where proportions are often exaggerated for a playful effect. Within this style, the proportions of their outfits and hairstyles are consistent and do not show distortion inconsistent with the chibi representation. Therefore, their appearance is rational within the context of chibi style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the act of the chibi-fied players holding tennis rackets and shaking hands seem structurally consistent and free from deformation, fitting naturally into the pastoral setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon players are shown holding tennis rackets and shaking hands, which aligns with typical animation practices, where such interactions are depicted in straightforward, clear ways. The characters, though stylized, have actions and objects (tennis rackets) that match their proportions, exhibiting structural consistency in their interactions. Although this is an edited image in a pastoral setting, the style choice seems to maintain structural logic within its animated context.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the semi-transparent court logo in the background appear naturally integrated and does not introduce any visual distractions or distortions that detract from the sceneâ€™s authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The semi-transparent court logo in Image B is neatly placed in the grassy area, not detracting from the scene as seen with typical logo placement on fields. Its transparency helps it blend into the scene while still being visible, avoiding visual distraction or distortion. Thus, it maintains the scene's overall balance without appearing intrusive or fake.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the inclusion of chibi-fied players with tennis rackets and the court logo maintain the image's compositional balance and visual plausibility, without disrupting the natural arrangement of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms a pastoral scene into an animated one. The addition of chibi-fied players and a logo might change the natural landscape perception, but within the cartoon context, it maintains a balanced composition. The players are centrally located, drawing focus while the logo appears unobtrusively in the foreground, together preserving compositional harmony.",
