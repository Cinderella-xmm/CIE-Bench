      "question": "Does the handbag maintain a natural, organic texture similar to the brain sculpture without any obvious unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handbag shows a texture on its flap that mimics the organic texture of the brain sculpture seen in Image A. The rest of the handbag is made of brown leather, complementing the organic theme without introducing unnatural elements. Visual cues indicate the handbag's texture appears seamlessly integrated, without artifacts that would otherwise disrupt the natural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the structure of the handbag consistent with the organic flow and design of the brain sculpture, avoiding any broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a handbag with a flap that carries a surface pattern akin to the brain sculpture's organic design in Image A. This flap's structure elegantly follows the organic flow exhibited in natural formations without displaying broken or abrupt geometric shapes, thus preserving aesthetic consistency between the images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fine details and material of the handbag preserved, ensuring it looks authentic and matches the brain sculpture's material quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handbag retains the intricate details of the brain sculpture's texture on its flap. The pattern, color, and implied material quality closely echo those of Image A, suggesting a deliberate effort to match the sculpture's detail and overall visual authenticity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the handbag proportionally and physically rational in relation to the brain sculpture, avoiding any distortion or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the handbag seems appropriately sized and scaled, similar to a typical handbag against the brain sculpture, without obvious distortions. This suggests an understanding of proportional logic used in the image edit, maintaining physical rationality in relation to the brain sculpture's scale seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the addition of the handbag maintain the overall composition and layout's visual credibility, ensuring it complements the brain sculpture without disrupting the visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B introduces the handbag with complementary colors and textures, aligning with the brain sculpture found in Image A. The combination avoids clashes or disruptions in visual harmony, suggesting a thoughtful integration that respects the initial composition.",
