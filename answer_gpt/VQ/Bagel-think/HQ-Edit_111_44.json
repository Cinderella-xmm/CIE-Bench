      "question": "Are the golden embroidery patterns on the central figure's dress consistent in texture and detail, showing no signs of artificial edges or repetitive digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the dress in Image B, the golden embroidery patterns appear to have rich details and a consistent texture flowing naturally with the fabric. The use of light and shadow contributes to the perception of embroidery details. There are no apparent signs of artificial edges or repetitive digital artifacts, indicating a high-quality integration of the embroidery into the dress design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the beads on the headdress in Image B, they appear well-integrated into the headdress design. The beads are proportionally scaled and positioned relative to each other and the headdress structure.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of baskets and produce in the foreground looks natural and consistent with how such items would typically be displayed in a marketplace. The objects do not display geometric distortions, and the overlaps between them appear natural, maintaining the scene's overall realism and coherence.",

      "question": "Are the historical symbols on the market goods (such as pottery or cloth) smoothly integrated into the surfaces, without visible seams or unnatural textural discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting the market goods in Image B, any historical symbols depicted on pottery or cloth do not exhibit visible seams or textural discontinuities. The symbols appear to be well-integrated into the surfaces, showing no signs of unnatural separations or misalignments that could suggest artificial insertion.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the central figure’s hands have five fingers each, with natural finger alignment and skin texture, and are the multiple bracelets and rings positioned without distorting the hand shape?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure’s hands are depicted with five fingers each. The arrangement of the fingers and the depiction of the skin texture appear natural. The various bracelets and rings are positioned in a manner that maintains the natural shape and form of the hands without any distortion, suggesting careful attention to anatomical correctness in the design.",
