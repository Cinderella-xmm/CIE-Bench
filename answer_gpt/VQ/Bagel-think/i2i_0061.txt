    "Question": "Q1: Does the watercolor effect applied across the image retain the structural coherence of the skater's pose and the ramp's form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor effect has partially altered the structural coherence of the skater's pose and ramp form. The overall posture of the skater is still recognizable, with his arm raised and body angled as though mid-movement on the ramp. The ramp is evident but has lost some of its crisp outlines, making it less clear. The pose and structure, while abstracted, are still coherent enough for identification.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the semi-abstract brushstrokes and blurred colors used for the ground and background buildings free from unnatural textures and artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a watercolor effect that uses semi-abstract brushstrokes and blurred colors, particularly in the ground and background. This effect leads to the ground and buildings merging into a fluid and abstract visual style, resembling watercolor art. While the textures are more diffused, they do not show distinct unnatural textures or artifacts that would detract from the authenticity of a typical watercolor painting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Has the skater’s body and clothing retained their proportions and physical rationality after applying the watercolor style?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the skater's body and clothing have been maintained despite the transformation into watercolor style. His limbs, torso, and clothing contours appear consistent with natural human proportions, and his pose still suggests movement and balance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the details on the skater's gray t-shirt and black shoes remain discernible after the watercolor treatment?",
    "explanation": "The watercolor effect in Image B has obscured some details, such as those on the gray t-shirt and black shoes. The t-shirt and shoes have lost much of their detail due to the watercolor abstraction, making these particular elements difficult to discern clearly.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the shapes and lines of the skater’s hands remained ergonomic and natural under the watercolor transformation?",
    "explanation": "The skater's hands in Image B retain a general shape indicating natural human hand positioning despite the watercolor effect. While the detail and crisp lines are absent, the hand shapes still appear to be in a natural pose consistent with the body movement of skating.",
    "answer": "Yes"
