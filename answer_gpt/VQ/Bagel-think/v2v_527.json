      "question": "Does the LEGO representation of the dog maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is represented in a LEGO-style format, sitting atop the stop sign. The form and structure of the dog are consistent with what would be expected from a LEGO model, displaying blocky features and clear, distinct edges typical of LEGO design. There are no noticeable artifacts or distortions that disrupt the visual coherence, maintaining the style's credibility.",

      "question": "Does the gradient shading used for the sky and clouds preserve their natural appearance and depth without introducing any unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky and clouds are depicted with a gradient shading technique. The transition between different shades of blue is smooth, and the clouds have a soft, natural appearance that blends well with the sky. There are no apparent artifacts or textures that appear out of place, preserving a believable atmospheric effect.",

      "question": "Does the LEGO-style stop sign retain its proper proportions and physical rationality, avoiding any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stop sign is recreated in a LEGO-style. Its geometrical shape, particularly the octagonal outline, remains distinct and proportionate, consistent with the physical expectations of a stop sign. There is no evidence of distortion or disproportion, indicating that the representation maintains its intended design and function.",

      "question": "Are the base and nameplate free of unnatural textures and artifacts, maintaining a natural appearance and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base and nameplate in Image B appear to be designed in a standard presentation format often used in display cases. The surface textures are smooth, and there are no distracting artifacts or irregularities that might detract from their designed credibility. The text on the nameplate is clear and aligned, although it may be nonsensical.",

      "question": "Does the transparent glass cube enclosure preserve its authenticity and natural appearance, without introducing any visual distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass cube enclosure is depicted with transparency that allows the LEGO model to be viewed clearly inside it. The edges of the glass are clean and straight with appropriate reflections and refractions, mimicking real glass properties. There are no obvious distortions or artifacts that would compromise the authenticity of the glass's appearance.",
