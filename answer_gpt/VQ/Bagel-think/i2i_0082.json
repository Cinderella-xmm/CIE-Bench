      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the metallic texture of the badge appear natural without introducing any unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic badge texture is observed, showing a smooth and reflective surface consistent with a metallic material. The texture appears uniform and free from any obvious unnatural artifacts or pixilation, which indicates that the editing has maintained the quality and natural appearance of the metallic texture.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the circular frame of the clock/badge perfectly round, without any visible geometric distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular frame of the badge is examined to observe if it maintains geometric correctness. The frame appears perfectly round, suggesting no visible geometric distortion or deformation. This shows that the circular shape has been preserved accurately in the editing process.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the hour, minute, and second hands retain their original proportions and alignment, avoiding any distortion or misplacement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the badge are evaluated for any distortions or misalignment. The three hands—hour, minute, and second—are proportionate to the size of the badge and appear correctly aligned as per their function. This suggests that the editing has kept the hands in their proper proportions and positions.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any inconsistent shadows or reflections on the metallic badge that contradict its physical placement as a keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, shadows and reflections on the metallic badge are analyzed. The reflections upon inspection are consistent with a metallic object, showing standard reflective surfaces without any irregularities or contradictions that would imply unnatural shadows or placement inconsistencies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the border thickness and surface finish of the metallic badge consistent and detailed enough to maintain the image's overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The border thickness and surface finish of the badge in Image B are examined. The border appears consistent in thickness around the badge, and the surface finish is polished, contributing to an authentic metallic appearance. This careful attention to detail supports the overall natural look of the badge.",
