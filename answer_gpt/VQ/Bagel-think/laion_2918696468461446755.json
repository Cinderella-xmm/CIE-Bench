      "question": "Do the trench coats and fedoras on all characters have natural fabric draping and proper fit without visible distortion or clipping against limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trench coats and fedoras on the characters appear to be drawn with some issues. The fabric draping does not appear entirely natural, with some sections looking stiff or awkwardly proportioned, which suggests distortion or clipping, particularly where clothing interacts with limbs. The shape of the fedoras seems similarly distorted, lacking natural curvature and fit.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the grayscale foggy cityscape background smoothly blended with the characters, showing consistent atmospheric perspective and no sharp boundaries or lost architectural details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grayscale foggy cityscape background does not blend smoothly with the characters. There is a noticeable lack of consistent atmospheric perspective, with some sharp boundaries between the characters and the background. This creates a disjointed appearance rather than a seamlessly integrated scene.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the central character’s hand holding the magnifying glass show five fingers with natural curvature and grip, and is the magnifying glass proportionally sized and positioned as if being used realistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand of the central character does not display five fingers with natural curvature and grip. There are visible distortions in the representation of the fingers, and the magnifying glass does not appear to be proportionally sized or realistically positioned as it would be if it were being used properly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the eyepatch on the central character’s face aligned with his facial structure and consistently shaded with the surrounding skin and lighting, without appearing detached or unnaturally bright/dark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyepatch on the central character's face is not well aligned with the facial structure. It appears disjointed, and there are inconsistencies in shading compared to the surrounding skin and lighting, making it appear detached and not integrated naturally with the rest of the face.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the title “Whispers of Shadows” and subtitle “A Mysterious Journey” displayed in a serif font at the top, properly spaced, readable, and not overlapping any character or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text present does not correspond to a properly displayed title or subtitle in a serif font. The text is instead mangled, appears unreadable, improperly spaced, and overlaps with background elements. This disrupts readability and visual coherence.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the blood-red streaks along the book edges smoothly rendered with uniform color intensity and no visible artifacts such as jagged edges or noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blood-red streaks along the book edges are not rendered smoothly. There are visible artifacts, including jagged edges, and the color intensity is inconsistent, leading to a lack of smoothness in the rendering.",
