      "question": "Does the bell-shaped body of the jellyfish have a consistent translucent appearance with no sharp edges, visible seams, or unnatural texture patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jellyfish's bell-shaped body is shown as translucent and smooth, similar to how jellyfish appear in nature. The visual cues suggest a naturally flowing structure without any abruptly ending or jagged edges. Such a texture aids in evoking the soft, gelatinous nature that jellyfish typically exhibit. Since no sharp edges or visible seams are present and no artificial-looking texture elements can be discerned, it supports the idea of a natural, continuous form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tendrils extending from the jellyfish's body smooth, curved, and iridescent, with no angular distortions or segmented appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tendrils of the jellyfish appear to be smoothly curved and possess a fluid-like quality. This perception aligns with the world knowledge of jellyfish anatomy, which usually includes long, flowing tendrils that move gracefully in water. The tendrils do not exhibit any angular distortions or unnatural segmentation that one might find in artificially constructed objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the internal glowing patterns within the jellyfish's bell appear as natural, swirling bioluminescent designs without repeating geometric shapes or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The internal illumination of the jellyfish's bell in Image B features a soft, swirling glow that resembles bioluminescence found in some marine animals. This appearance aligns with the unpredictable and organic nature of bioluminescent patterns, which do not commonly repeat in uniform geometric shapes nor contain harsh, jagged lines. Thus, the internal patterns appear natural and unforced.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing nodules along the tendrils softly illuminated with gradual light spread and positioned in a natural, non-uniform but plausible arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing nodules seen along the jellyfish's tendrils in Image B are soft and exhibit a gradual transition in brightness, which is visually consistent with realistic lighting conditions underwater. The positions of these nodules do not follow an overly strict or repeated pattern, imitating how natural occurrences might present themselves in an actual jellyfish, thus maintaining a realistically plausible alignment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ambient lighting in the scene diffused and tinted with blue-green hues, and are there faint water particles or depth cues visible around the jellyfish, consistent with an underwater environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the jellyfish in an environment with ambient lighting characterized by blue-green hues, which are typical of underwater settings due to light absorption and scattering in water. Additionally, there are indications of faint water particles or other depth cues within the scene, enhancing the perception of being submerged in water.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the connection point between the jellyfish and the ceiling smooth and continuous, with no floating segments or abrupt breaks in structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evident connection between the jellyfish and a ceiling. The jellyfish appears to be free-floating in an underwater environment. The question might suggest a non-existent scenario or a potential misunderstanding of the scene's context. The image doesn't depict any anchor points or abrupt transitions suggesting a connection to a ceiling.",
