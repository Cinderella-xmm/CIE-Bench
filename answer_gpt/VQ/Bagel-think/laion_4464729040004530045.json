      "question": "Does the bodice and skirt exhibit natural fabric folds and draping consistent with the weight and volume of Victorian-era garments, especially at the waist and hip regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress appears to be inspired by Victorian-era fashion, with a floral pattern and lace detailing. The fabric appears to drape naturally, with folds visible at the waist and skirt, suggesting the weight and volume typical of Victorian garments. This indicates an attention to detail that aligns with historic fashion design, showing natural and expected draping.",
