      "question": "Does the transformed roof retain its triangular silhouette with smooth, continuous edges and display detailed icy etchings that appear integrated into the surface rather than overlaid or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed structure has a triangular silhouette, which appears smooth and continuous. The icy etchings give the impression they are integrated into the surface, as they are consistently detailed and do not display signs of overlay or fragmentation, maintaining an intrinsic appearance. The analysis process involves observing the geometric shape and surface details, which do not show any interruption or artificial overlay.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the snow-covered areas transformed into wing-like forms that exhibit consistent translucency, subtle internal light diffusion, and seamless integration with the surrounding terrain without visible seams or unnatural brightness gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows wing-like forms that appear to have a consistent level of translucency and internal light diffusion. They blend seamlessly with the surrounding terrain, without visible seams or unnatural brightness gradients. This conclusion is drawn by observing the even translucency and how well the forms integrate into the landscape, avoiding abrupt changes in light or structure.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the rocky outcrops in the foreground and midground form leg-like structures with anatomically plausible proportions, smooth transitions between segments, and moss textures that match the surrounding environment without appearing pasted or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B shows leg-like structures formed from rocky outcrops which maintain anatomically plausible proportions and smooth transitions between segments. The moss textures match the surrounding environment, showing continuity without appearing pasted or distorted. The judgment is based on the proportionality and seamless integration of the structures with the natural landscape.",

      "question": "Does the stream display a uniform, low-intensity glow along its entire length that follows the natural flow path, without sudden bright spots, broken lines, or inconsistent illumination patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stream does not display a uniform glow; rather, there is no evident luminescence along its length. The stream retains its natural appearance without an additional glow effect, featuring water that flows consistently without sudden bright spots or broken lines, meaning it follows the natural texture and lighting of the original image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the fog layer distributed evenly across the upper mountain regions and seamlessly blended with the sky and terrain, preserving depth cues and avoiding abrupt transitions or unnatural cloud formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fog layer appears evenly distributed across the mountain regions, seamlessly blending with the sky and terrain. Depth cues are preserved, ensuring a natural transition without any abrupt changes or unnatural cloud formations. This observation is drawn from the balanced diffusion of fog, maintaining a consistent appearance without sudden disruptions or irregular shapes.",
