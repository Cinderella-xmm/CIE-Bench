    "Question": "Q1: Are the gemstone inlays embedded into the crown surface without visible gaps or floating elements, and does the crown retain the original curvature of the marble top?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a crown is placed atop the cabinet, which visually appears to be set directly on the surface, indicating no visible gaps or floating elements between the crown and the surface. It seems well-integrated, following the curvature of the cabinet top. Using knowledge about decorations, such integration reflects continuous design, indicating that the crown is embedded without gaps and maintains the original shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the robe follow the original cabinet’s curved sides and tapering shape, and do the fabric folds and patterns flow naturally without sharp breaks or artificial lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robe draped around the cabinet mimics its structure, following the curved side and tapering shape. Observing visual elements, the robe's fabric folds appear to be naturally flowing without sharp breaks, suggesting continuity in design. World knowledge about fabric behavior and design confirms the realistic portrayal of flowing folds consistent with the original cabinet's form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the drawer engravings positioned at the waistline as belt buckles, aligned with the robe’s structure, and connected with visible straps or fastenings that appear physically plausible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the engravings on the drawers are seen as decorative elements akin to belt buckles positioned at the waistline. While the robe covers most drawers, visual details suggest plausible alignment with the structure. However, there are no visible straps or fastenings that would indicate a functional connection consistent with belt designs, leading to a less plausible physical integration.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the clawed feet maintain the original leg length and thickness, and are the claws proportionally sized and fully touching the ground without appearing detached or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clawed feet are seen at the bottom of the cabinet. Comparing to Image A, the legs in Image B retain the length and thickness but the claws appear large and imposing, yet proportionate. By examining the visual placement, the claws are seen as touching the ground correctly, maintaining physical plausibility in alignment and size, ensuring natural placement without detachment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the drawer openings transformed into pouches with visible flap closures and stitching, and do they hang from the robe with realistic weight and attachment points?",
    "explanation": "Image B retains the presentation of drawers, which differ from pouch designs. The visual cues show drawers opening without transformation into bags or pouches, as they lack flap closures, stitches, and realistic hanging elements from the robe. Knowledge of object transformation in design verifies that drawers do not mimic pouch features, suggesting a lack of related design elements.",
    "answer": "No"
