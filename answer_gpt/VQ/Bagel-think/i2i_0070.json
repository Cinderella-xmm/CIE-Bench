      "question": "Does the African savanna at night blend seamlessly with the existing train and tracks, without any unnatural edges or contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition from the railway tracks to the surrounding savanna landscape can be analyzed by observing the continuity and natural integration of elements. A well-blended image would have consistent lighting, color grading, and no visible discrepancies at the edges where different elements meet. Upon examination, the savanna backdrop and the train tracks appear to have a stark contrast, suggesting that the components may not blend seamlessly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stars and the Milky Way depicted naturally, without any artificial or pixelated textures disrupting their appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the Milky Way and stars should be smooth and detailed to appear natural. Natural appearances involve gradual shading, clear resolution, and consistency in star placements. Upon inspection, while the Milky Way is quite striking, there might be areas demonstrating unnatural brightness or stark pixelation indicating artificial texture.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the train and tracks correspond logically to the new nighttime savanna setting, maintaining structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A logical lighting scheme would require the illumination on the train and tracks to be soft and diffused, matching night conditions. In Image B, examining shadow angles and the overall tonal adjustments can indicate if they align with a night setting. The train's lighting does not appear to reflect realistic night-time settings, showing brighter highlights than expected, suggesting inconsistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the size of the train relative to the vastness of the African savanna and the starry sky proportionally correct and believable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A correct proportion between the train and the surrounding savanna involves the train appearing suitably smaller and integrated within the vastness. However, in Image B, the train seems disproportionately prominent compared to widely expansive savanna and sky, impacting the believability of the scene's scale.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the train been preserved without degradation or introduction of unnatural textures during the editing process?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, preservation of fine details means maintaining clarity and texture consistent with the original image. Focus areas include observing clarity and integrity in train features like edges and paint textures. The details seem to have been preserved well, without apparent degradation or introduction of unusual textures during editing.",
