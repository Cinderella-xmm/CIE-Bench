      "question": "Does the child's coat maintain a coherent shape with natural folds and no distorted or broken seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child's coat appears to have a smooth shape and natural folds similar to what one would expect in a real scenario. The seams are intact, without any visible distortions. The coat displays a consistent structure that aligns with typical garment patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the balloon surfaces evenly colored in pastel tones without visible color bleeding or loss of specular highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the balloons have evenly distributed pastel colors, which are consistent throughout the entire surface. The specular highlights on the balloons are present, resulting in a shiny appearance typical for balloons, thus indicating no color bleeding or loss of highlights.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the childâ€™s right hand holding the balloons have exactly five fingers with natural joint alignment and no extra or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child's right hand is depicted with five fingers. The fingers appear well-aligned and naturally jointed, consistent with typical human anatomy, and there are no signs of additional or missing digits.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the watercolor texture applied uniformly across the wheat field without disrupting the visibility of individual stalks or creating unnatural stroke lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a watercolor texture applied to the wheat field, and each stalk remains visible, suggesting that the brushstroke application did not obscure individual elements. The watercolor effect is smoothly integrated without causing unnatural stroke lines.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the calendar grid positioned at ground level and aligned with the path beneath the child, without floating or casting unrealistic shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar grid is located near the bottom in front of the child. However, it contains pegs, which imply a hanging mechanism, giving the impression that it may not be directly affixed to the ground. This positioning does not disrupt ground alignment severely but hints at elevation above the path, thus failing to fully respect ground-level alignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the clouds in the sky maintain natural edges and volume without visible pixelation or unnatural smoothing effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are depicted with natural edges and correct volumetric appearance. They do not exhibit pixelation or unusual smoothness that would distract from a realistic appearance. The texture and form align with natural atmospheric cloud formations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
