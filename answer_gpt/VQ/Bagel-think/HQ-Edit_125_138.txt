    "Question": "Q1: Are the golden batik patterns on the dancer's dress clearly defined, continuous, and free from pixelation or jagged edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual presentation of the dress is crucial to determine the clarity and continuity of the batik patterns. By focusing on the dress, the patterns appear defined and continue smoothly without abrupt disruptions or pixelated segments. This suggests a high-resolution render that avoids jagged edges or digital artifacts. The presence of clear and uninterrupted patterns indicates an attention to detail in the editing process.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the line-drawn version of the temple maintain accurate tier alignment and structural symmetry without missing or distorted roof layers?",
    "explanation": "The temple in Image B is rendered as a line drawing, which requires careful alignment of tiers and structural elements to maintain symmetry. By examining the visual lines and tier structure, the temple appears balanced, with roof layers accurately depicted without noticeable distortion or gaps. The symmetrical portrayal indicates precision in converting the temple into a line-drawn style, retaining the architectural integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the two guardian statues on either side of the pathway identical in size, pose, and position relative to the central temple axis?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, attention is directed at the two guardian statues flanking the path leading to the temple. A careful comparison of their size and positioning reveals that the statues are symmetrical in both dimensions and stance, maintaining consistency in their relative position to the central temple axis. There are no visible discrepancies in their proportions, suggesting meticulous editing to ensure uniformity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do both of the dancerâ€™s hands show five fingers each with natural spacing, smooth contours, and no deformation or extra digits?",
    "explanation": "Checking the hands of the dancer in Image B involves confirming the naturalism of finger presentation. Both hands are depicted showing five fingers, with smooth contour lines and natural spacing, which appear free from irregularities such as deformation or additional digits. The anatomical depiction reflects a coherent and realistic rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the text positioned in a way that does not overlap or obscure the dancer, temple, or guardian statues, and is it clearly readable without visual clutter?",
    "explanation": "The placement and readability of text in Image B are determined by its relation to other visual elements. The text is positioned clearly above the central focal points: the dancer, temple, and guardian statues. By ensuring the text does not overlap or interfere with these elements, it maintains readability and avoids contributing to visual clutter, achieving a clean layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
