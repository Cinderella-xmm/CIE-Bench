      "question": "Are the crystal facets on the sandcastle uniformly shaped and aligned with the original tower geometry, without any jagged or incomplete edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle is represented as a crystal model inside a display case. The facets of the crystal are clearly and precisely cut, showcasing uniform shapes that align with the castle's geometry. The edges are smooth and complete, reflecting skilled craftsmanship typical of such works. Comparing to Image A, where the sandcastle is made from sand and has a natural and uneven texture, the edited version in glass displays a regularly shaped and faceted design, indicative of high precision and intentional continuity in edge quality.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gemstones replace the seashells accurately in position and size, and do they exhibit smooth, reflective surfaces without floating above the sand or water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, various gemstones are placed at the base of the crystal castle, replacing the earlier seashells depicted in Image A. The gemstones are positioned similarly, maintaining proportional correctness relative to the base of the castle. They exhibit smooth, reflective surfaces which adequately reflect light, further emphasizing their polished nature. There's no visual indication of them floating, as they're securely positioned on the frosted glass base, maintaining cohesive interaction with the surrounding environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wave pattern on the frosted glass surface continuous and flowing, with no abrupt breaks or unnatural line interruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frosted glass surface in Image B features an etched wave pattern flowing consistently beneath the crystal castle. The line continuity and smoothness suggest an uninterrupted design execution, devoid of abrupt or unnatural breaks. This design is deliberate, evoking the natural flow of water waves which is evident through the uniformity and fluidity of the pattern. Comparing this to Image A, which shows natural ocean waves with variation in form, the edited version mimics this continuous ebb without tangible disruptions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the display case visible and straight, with no clipping or warping of the internal elements, and do they align with the perspective of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the display case edges are crisply defined, showing straight, clear lines with no visual warp or distortion. These edges demarcate the internal contents effectively, ensuring that all elements remain in appropriate perspective without any clipping. The alignment indicates a professionally designed display case, and the internal facets of the glass structure mirror this precision without interfering with the castle's visual perspective. Image A offers no such framing, thus the focus is exclusively on Image B's integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the red shovel with yellow handle fully visible and undistorted, lying flat on the surface without intersecting or appearing behind glass where it shouldnâ€™t be?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a red shovel with a yellow handle, as seen in Image A. Instead, the display case frames a crystal sandcastle with no such items present. In Image A, the shovel is somewhat embedded in the sand beside the sandcastle, visible and appropriately lying on the beach surface. In comparison, Image B focuses exclusively on the crystal representation within the case, and thus deliberately excludes any sandy or beach-related components like the shovel.",
