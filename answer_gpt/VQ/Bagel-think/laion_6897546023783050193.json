      "question": "Are the robes depicted with consistent indigo and gold patterns that follow the contours of the original drapery without visible seams or unnatural texture breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe displays a consistent indigo color with the gold background accentuating it, following a stylized form similar to traditional Japanese art. There are no visible seams or texture breaks in the robe pattern, maintaining a smooth, continuous appearance. By referencing the original, Image A, it can be confirmed that while the texture has changed to a stylized illustration, the robe still maintains its contour consistent with Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the arms feature calligraphic lines that follow the natural curvature of the limbs without distorting the hands or creating more than five fingers per hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms in Image B are depicted with elegant, calligraphic lines typical of Japanese woodblock art. These lines trace the arms’ natural curves without distortion and maintain an anatomically correct number of fingers—five per hand. Comparing this with Image A, the proportions match, retaining natural limb depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the face composed of clean, continuous outlines that preserve the shape of the eyes, nose, and mouth without exaggerated or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Excluding the blurred face, the illustration style in Image B uses sharp, clean lines typical of a stylized artistic representation. Therefore, the image suggests that similar attention to detail is applied to the facial features, with clean contours and no exaggerated or broken lines, aligning with traditional art forms, though a direct comparison is not visible due to blurring.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wave-like clouds in the background smoothly blended with the statue's silhouette, without sharp boundaries or overlapping inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background of stylized waves and clouds with a seamless transition into the figure's silhouette, indicative of traditional Japanese prints, where elements frequently integrate smoothly. There are no rough edges or inconsistencies apparent, suggesting a harmonious background integration. Comparing it to Image A which has a clear background, the blending in Image B is consistent and artistically coherent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the statue's posture stable, with arms symmetrically extended and the head centered above the torso, showing no signs of misalignment or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a figure with arms symmetrically extended in alignment with the body, maintaining the stable posture from Image A. The artistic transformation has not altered the symmetry or stability of the pose. The head is centered above the torso, demonstrating correct alignment without any deformation.",
