    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the tallest tower on the left retain its original vertical structure and proportional height after being modified with robotic limb features, without any visible stretching, compression, or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tallest tower on the left has been creatively edited to feature robotic limb motifs. However, its vertical structure appears distorted by these additional features, as they disrupt its original proportional height and may introduce visual disjointedness compared to Image A. As a result, the robot elements refresh the building's facade without preserving the unaltered proportions of the original architecture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the neon circuitry patterns on the EMAAR building and nearby towers smoothly integrated into the facade without visible line breaks, uneven spacing, or unnatural color gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An examination of Image B reveals neon circuitry patterns on buildings that are creatively artificial and do not naturally reflect integrated engineering. The circuitry might exhibit aspects like uneven spacing or color gradients, which are often indications of added elements that havenâ€™t been seamlessly integrated into pre-existing structures.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the scale-like panels on the dark glass towers exhibit uniform texture and reflection behavior, with no repeating patterns or distorted shapes suggesting low-quality rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates scale-like panels on some buildings, which generally should maintain uniformity in texture and reflection quality to suggest high-quality rendering. However, due to the editing process here introducing uniform mechanical motifs, the presence of repeating patterns or inconsistency in reflection can suggest a manufactured appearance inconsistent with natural rendering.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the glowing expressway spines maintain realistic width and curvature throughout their length, connecting logically to surrounding roads and showing no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing features, reminiscent of expressway spines, must appear to have a consistent width and believable curvature to seem integrated with their environment. If any segments appear to be floating without logical attachment to roads, it would indicate editing artifacts that disrupt the realistic appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fin-like structures added to the tops of the buildings properly aligned with the rooflines and scaled appropriately, without appearing detached or structurally unstable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fin-like structures in Image B should logically align with building tops for stability. However, if they seem merely placed rather than integrated, some alignment or scaling inconsistency may become evident, resulting in a visual of detachment and instability.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the holographic eye-like elements located on top of major towers clearly defined with smooth light emission and no visible digital artifacts such as aliasing or double images?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the quality of holographic elements in Image B, they should be observed for clarity and consistent light quality. Artifacts like aliasing or double images are digital flaws indicating less precise edits. The inclusion of these artefacts would result in imperfect visual elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all illuminated windows, signs, and architectural details (e.g., on the EMAAR building and VOCO tower) sharp and legible, with no visible blurring or degradation from the editing process?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B should maintain clarity in all detailed sections, such as windows or signs, to be visually effective. If illuminated features appear blurred or degraded compared to the original clarity in Image A, it indicates deterioration from the editing, especially where intentional robot-themed enhancements have been made.",
