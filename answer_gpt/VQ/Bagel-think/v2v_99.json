      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D soccer player appear to blend seamlessly with the realistic soccer field and stadium without any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style soccer player stands out significantly as it is cartoonish in nature, contrasting with the more realistic background of the soccer field and stadium. This difference in styles creates a noticeable inconsistency in the visual coherence of the entire image, as the realistic elements don't match the cartoonish character style, making it clear they're part of different visual contexts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the soccer field, stadium, and cheering crowd still visually plausible and structurally coherent, without any distortions or unnatural textures introduced by the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer field, stadium, and cheering crowd maintain their realistic appearance, similar to Image A. The structure and the visual presentation of these elements remain free of distortions and expected textures persist, indicating no significant alterations have compromised their initial plausibility or coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D soccer player maintain proper proportions and physical logic, avoiding any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style soccer player in Image B appears to be designed with proportions typical of chibi characters, which include exaggerated and simplified features like a larger head and shorter limbs. Despite these exaggerated proportions, they are characteristic of the chibi design aesthetic and do not indicate any distortion or broken forms, maintaining intended proportional logic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the chibi-style 3D soccer player look natural and free of any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style soccer player in Image B uses materials and textures typical of 3D-animated characters, such as smooth surfaces and simplistic textural representation of clothing and body parts. These fit into the expected aesthetic of a chibi character without exhibiting any unnatural artifacts that distract from this style.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the action pose of the chibi-style 3D soccer player consistent with the original image, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style soccer player closely replicates the action pose of the player in Image A, suggesting that despite the stylistic shift, the pose remains consistent in framing and positioning. This ensures the structural consistency and visual credibility of the action depicted, showing no deviations in pose logic, only in character style.",
