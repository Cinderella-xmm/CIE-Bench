    "Question": "Q1: Are the cloud formations above the explosion composed of distinct geometric shapes that follow the overall contour of the mushroom cloud without disrupting its volumetric form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cloud formations are rendered in a stylized, pop art manner characterized by bright, distinct geometric shapes and bold outlines. These shapes do follow the overall contour of a traditional mushroom cloud, with curves and outlines suggesting the volumetric nature of an explosion, despite being highly abstract. Therefore, the design captures the essence of a mushroom cloud while utilizing geometric forms.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the neon-colored elements in the explosion maintain consistent brightness and contrast relative to the surrounding sky and water, avoiding abrupt or physically implausible luminance shifts?",
    "explanation": "Image B employs bright, pop art colors that are consistent in brightness and contrast. The neon shades are uniformly applied across the image, displaying no abrupt shifts that would break the cohesive style typical for pop art where bold, contrasting colors are balanced harmoniously.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the palm trees depicted with thick black outlines and simplified shapes, positioned correctly along the beach wall without overlapping or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees are depicted with thick black outlines and simplified, stylized forms, consistent with the pop art style. They are arranged along the beach without any overlapping or misaligned edges, maintaining clear positional accuracy relative to other elements like the shoreline.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Has the islandâ€™s terrain been reduced to abstract geometric shapes that maintain correct spatial relationships with the sea and horizon, without floating or disconnected sections?",
    "explanation": "The island in Image B is represented using simplified geometric forms which still adhere to the spatial relationship necessary to make it appear as an island. It correctly lines up with the horizon and the sea, with no parts that appear floating or disconnected, maintaining its positional integrity in this stylized context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the sky and water rendered with flat colors and clean outlines, matching the pop art style, without visible texture degradation or mismatched lighting effects?",
    "explanation": "The sky and water in Image B are rendered with flat, uniform colors typical of pop art, utilizing clean and defined outlines. There is a harmony between colors and lighting effects that are consistent with the pop art style, demonstrating no texture degradation or mismatched lighting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
