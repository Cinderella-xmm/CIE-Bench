    "Question": "Q1: Do the metallic textures on the cyclist’s outfit and helmet reflect light consistently with the scene’s illumination and maintain accurate surface contours without warping?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image B, the cyclist's outfit and helmet feature a metallic texture that interacts with the scene's lighting. The reflections are aligned with the direction and intensity of ambient light, and the surface contours mirror realistic anatomical shapes, indicating no warping. The metallic finish is rendered in a manner that does not disrupt the natural flow of light across the surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the electric blue neon glow lines along the road edges and on the cyclist and car smooth, evenly lit, and free from jagged edges or overlapping with real-world details like tires or license plates?",
    "explanation": "In image B, the electric blue neon glow lines are added to enhance the futuristic theme. These lines appear smooth and evenly lit, maintaining a consistent glow without jagged edges. They are also strategically placed to avoid overlapping with physical elements such as car tires or the license plate, ensuring a clean integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the transparent visor data display on the cyclist’s helmet aligned with the helmet’s curvature, showing clear digital content without ghosting, blurring, or distortion?",
    "explanation": "In image B, the visor's digital data display is seamlessly integrated to follow the curvature of the helmet. The content remains clear and sharp without any signs of ghosting, blurring, or distortion, which suggests that the design took into account how displays should naturally curve and align with the helmet surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the holographic cycling stats near the escort car spatially coherent, appropriately sized relative to the car, and displayed with soft edges and ambient glow without casting incorrect shadows?",
    "explanation": "The edited image B features holographic stats that appear suitably sized in relation to the escort car. The stats maintain spatial coherence and are marked by soft edges and an ambient glow. This integration ensures that there are no harsh shadows or mismatches in the holographic elements, providing a consistent and believable overlay.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do all edited elements—including metallic finishes, neon glows, digital visor display, and holographic projections—coexist without visual contradictions such as mismatched lighting, texture clashes, or distorted shapes?",
    "explanation": "Image B combines various elements such as metallic finishes, neon glows, and digital displays. All these enhancements are aligned with the scene's lighting conditions, maintaining harmony without creating textures or lighting inconsistencies. The edited elements are uniformly executed, translating a cohesive and visually integrated scene, free from contradictions or distortions that could hamper realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
