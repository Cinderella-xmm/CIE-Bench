      "question": "Do the golden horn-like spikes on the headstock align symmetrically with the neck and show no signs of clipping, distortion, or mismatched angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headstock features additional horn-like spikes that appear to be part of the design. To assess symmetry, each spike should mirror its counterpart on the opposite side. From the visual cues, these spikes are evenly aligned on both sides of the headstock, following a consistent angle that matches the neck's aesthetics. There are no evident signs of clipping or distortion, as they protrude naturally as if they belong there. This symmetry suggests the horns are intentionally designed and well-integrated.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the luminescent runes clearly visible along the fretboard without bleeding into the wood or appearing as separate floating overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the fretboard does not display luminescent runes but remains unchanged with the standard guitar fret markers intact. There is no indication of runes bleeding into the wood or appearing detached, as this element is absent in the edited design. The fretboard retains its original, unmodified appearance in terms of such features.",

      "question": "Do the fiery tendrils originate from the bridge and terminate at the nut, following a continuous and uninterrupted path without gaps or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, fiery tendrils seem to wind across the guitar body. These tendrils start from the bridge area, which aligns with the concept of energy emanating from this central point on a musical instrument. They do not stretch along the neck up to the nut. While the tendrils have a dynamic appearance over the body, they do not maintain a path along the entire neck, which means they do not form a continuous line to the nut.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wing structures symmetrical on both sides of the body and covered in evenly spaced, realistic scale patterns without gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the guitar body is outfitted with prominent dragon wings extending from either side. These wings have a symmetrical structure, both in shape and size, aligning visually with the guitar's central line. The scale patterns appear evenly spaced with intricate details, emulating a realistic dragon texture. The patterns are consistent across the wings, showing no visible gaps or distortions, indicating a well-executed, balanced design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the body maintain the original guitar's silhouette while showing consistent dragon-like textures such as scales or ridges, with no visible seams or loss of contour detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar body retains its essential silhouette like that of the original image, ensuring the instrument's identity is still recognizable. However, it incorporates dragon-like textures artistically into the body, including scales and winding serpent-like patterns. These elements appear seamlessly integrated, maintaining the original contour and detail without disrupting the guitar's basic shape. There is no visible misalignment or design flaw.",
