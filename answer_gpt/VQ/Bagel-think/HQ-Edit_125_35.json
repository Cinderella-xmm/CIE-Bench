      "question": "Are the metallic scales along the transformed body of the saxophone uniformly textured and seamlessly integrated without visible artifacts or breaks in continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the saxophone has been transformed into a serpent-like form with metallic scales. The scales appear to be consistently textured and well-integrated across the length of the serpentine form. The seams between scales are not visible, indicating a seamless integration. The reflection and texture properties of the scales are consistently maintained throughout the form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gemstone replacements for the saxophone keys exhibit natural reflective qualities and geometric precision matching their original positions without deformation or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a modification where gemstones replace the keys of the saxophone. These gemstones are precisely positioned in the place of original keys and each gemstone displays natural reflective qualities, indicative of high-quality rendering. There is no visible deformation or misalignment of these gemstones from their expected positions, contributing to an intact overall appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transformation of the saxophone bell into an open maw with fangs structurally coherent, with no distorted edges or unnatural curvature in the jawline or teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the saxophone's bell has been transformed into a dragon's open maw with visible fangs. The structure of the maw appears coherent, with smooth edges and a natural curvature in both the jawline and teeth. The fangs are evenly aligned, contributing to an overall structurally sound transformation without any visible distortion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the coiled body extension of the saxophone follow a logical spiral path with consistent thickness and detailed filigree patterns that appear continuous and non-repetitive?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image in Image B displays a coiled saxophone resembling a dragon form. The body follows a logical spiral path, maintaining consistent thickness throughout. The filigree patterns on the body are detailed, with continuous textures that avoid repetition, thus making the design appear intentional and well-crafted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the barbed tongue emerging from the modified reed positioned correctly within the maw and does it have a consistent, realistic texture and shape without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the transformed image of the saxophone, the reed is modified to show a barbed tongue. This tongue appears correctly positioned within the dragon-like maw and exhibits a consistent texture and shape, blending naturally with the rest of the structure without any signs of detachment or misalignment.",
