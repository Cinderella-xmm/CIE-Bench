    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the monocled eye on the front face of the clock seamlessly integrated into the original frame, with no visible seam or texture discontinuity around its perimeter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the monocled eye is strategically placed within the frame. However, there is a noticeable difference in texture and design between the monocled eye and the surrounding area, indicating a lack of seamless integration. The visual elements like the monocle's edge contrast with the clock's material, suggesting a deliberate addition for effect rather than a natural fit. In Image A, the clock face is uniformly integrated into the framework, showing continuous texture and design which is absent in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gear-like limbs extend from the side panels of the clock with continuous material flow and geometric alignment, showing no signs of floating or disconnected joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gear-like limbs protrude from the side panels, exhibiting a design that appears distinct from the rest of the clock, with visible joints and articulations. There's a sense of mechanical addition, with potential discontinuities observable at the connection points with the clock's structure. In Image A, no such extensions exist, supporting the observation of the gears as an afterthought addition in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the pendulum converted into a tail that extends downward from the bottom center of the clock, maintaining a smooth curvature and consistent material texture with the rest of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pendulum remains unchanged. It hangs vertically and is consistent with the clock's design and texture, but it does not extend downward as a tail or exhibit conversion into any new structure. Observing Image A reaffirms this, as the pendulum is visible inside the clock casing, unchanged in both images.",

      "question": "Are the brass and copper tones applied uniformly across the clock’s surface, matching the lighting direction and showing realistic reflections and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an application of brass and copper tones that appear relatively uniform across the clock’s surface. However, the lighting and reflections do not fully match the directional light and shadow play portrayed in a realistic context, indicating a slight inconsistency in the distribution and interaction of tones with light. Image A contrasts sharply with its monochrome texture, underlining the difference in tone application.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the steam valves placed at each corner of the clock’s upper section, protruding outward with clean edges and no overlap or deformation of the surrounding structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no steam valves present at the corners of the clock’s upper section. The design retains its traditional look without any elements like protruding valves, maintaining clean edges without overlap or deformation. Image A consistently shows the original clock structure without such features, affirming the absence of steam valves.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the engraved patterns along the clock’s base and sides clear, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the original ornamental design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the engraved patterns on the base and sides are retained in a stylistically similar manner to those in Image A, showing continuity in the ornamental design. They appear clear and evenly spaced, matching the artistic and historical aesthetic observed in the original image. Image A offers the basis for this consistency, with its intricate engravings evident both images, supporting a coherent pattern portrayal.",
