    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass dome cover the entire scene without distorting the underlying elements such as the house, tree, or ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome is clear and encompasses the entire scene, including the house, tree, and ground. The visual integrity of these elements appears unaffected by the dome, indicating no distortion. The clarity of the dome suggests it is properly designed for display without altering the appearance of what's inside.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mossy green pathways aligned with the terrain level and blended naturally with the surrounding ground texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mossy green pathways are placed in a way that seems aligned with the rest of the terrain. They look like they seamlessly blend in with the steps and existing ground textures, maintaining a cohesive appearance with the surrounding natural elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the newly added shrubs have a size and texture consistent with the existing plants in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows shrubs that visually appear similar in size and texture to the tree on the left side of the scene. This consistent sizing and texturing suggest that the shrubs have been integrated to match the existing botanical elements, maintaining uniformity in the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the lake positioned on the ground with defined edges and a reflective surface that interacts realistically with surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lake in Image B is placed at the base of the scene with clear, defined edges. The reflective surface simulates water, adding depth and realistic interaction with its surroundings, such as the bridge and land, which suggests a well-integrated feature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fairy lights wrapped around the tree branches in a way that follows their shape and emits a soft, uniform glow without harsh highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There appears to be no evidence of fairy lights being included in Image B; thus, their presence and characteristics cannot be evaluated based on the existing image. The question presupposes an element not visible in the provided Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bridge span the lake with stable supports and connect directly to the ground on both sides without floating or tilting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bridge in Image B is depicted as having a firm connection on both sides of the lake, giving the appearance of being well-supported and stable. There is no indication of any floating or tilting, which means it adds structural coherence to the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all added elements (dome, lake, bridge, lights) rendered with materials and lighting that match the rustic, natural aesthetic of the original scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Elements such as the dome, lake, and bridge in Image B hold to the rustic, natural aesthetic of the scene through their materials and lighting. However, since fairy lights are not visibly included, they cannot be assessed. The existing elements maintain a coherence in style with the original components such as the house and surroundings.",
