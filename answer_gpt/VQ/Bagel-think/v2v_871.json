      "question": "Do the added LEGO minifigure and pear-inspired animal design appear naturally integrated into the scene without introducing any unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible LEGO minifigure or pear-inspired animal design present. The image shows a pear inside a glass cube mounted on a matte black base. Therefore, the question about the integration of a LEGO minifigure or pear-inspired animal design is not applicable to Image B. The elements present in the image appear cohesive without any unnatural textures or artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the LEGO minifigure and pear-inspired animal design logically consistent with the size and scale of the pear and smartphone in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition does not include a LEGO minifigure or pear-inspired animal design. Instead, it features a pear in a glass cube on a black base. Since there is no such design present, the question regarding the proportions and shapes of a LEGO minifigure or pear-inspired animal in relation to the pear and smartphone does not have a basis for evaluation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the glass cube, matte black base, and nameplate retain their natural appearance and fine details without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass cube enclosing the pear, the matte black base, and the nameplate are all clearly visible. The glass appears transparent and reflective as expected from a real glass material, while the matte black base and the nameplate display smooth surfaces without visible digital artifacts. These elements collectively maintain a natural look with attention to fine details, showcasing a professional level of editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the placement of the LEGO minifigure, pear-inspired animal, and nameplate within the transparent glass cube create a visually coherent and plausible composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B only displays a pear within a transparent glass cube on a matte black base, topped with a nameplate, but without a LEGO minifigure or pear-inspired animal. The placement of the pear in the glass cube is visually coherent, and the composition alludes to a display case or artifact, which makes for a plausible presentation. Thus, while the specified items are not in the cube, the existing elements are well-composed.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting and background color transition from a soft caramel shade to a gentle cream tone enhance the natural appearance and authenticity of the wooden surface and other elements in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is soft and consistent, transitioning from a caramel to cream tone. This gradient helps to highlight the wood grain on the surface where the glass cube is placed, lending a warm and authentic appearance. The subtle and well-balanced lighting ensures the overall image elements, including the pear, cube, and base, are naturally integrated with an appealing atmosphere.",
