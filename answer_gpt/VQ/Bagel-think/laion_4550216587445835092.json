    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and grin added to the energy blast positioned within the glowing orb and aligned with its curvature, without creating jagged edges or broken light paths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing orb surrounding the character does not seem to feature any additional facial features like eyes or a grin. Instead, it shows a clear depiction of the energy blast. The orb is evenly illuminated and does not appear to disrupt the light paths through features that would create a jagged appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dialogue bubble positioned so that it does not overlap with Naruto’s face or hand, and does it have clean borders and readable text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dialogue bubbles in Image B are positioned away from the character, ensuring they do not overlap with the character's major features such as the face or hand. The borders around the dialogue bubbles are clean, and the text, although stylized to resemble alien or fantasy script, is adequately clear within the context of its visual design.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the motion lines and energy beams from the spirit and Naruto’s attack converge smoothly at the fusion point, showing continuous flow without abrupt breaks or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the energy effects and motion lines are artistically depicted to show a smooth blend and convergence towards the main action foci. The visual effects are well matched with consistently flowing energy beams and trails, though this chibi-style representation emphasizes a more stylized rather than realistic depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the debris and elemental fragments in the background rendered with consistent lighting and shadow, appearing to float in a shared 3D space rather than being pasted flatly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of debris and elemental fragments appears three-dimensional, as they feature shading and highlights consistent with the lighting direction suggested by the energy blast. This suggests a sense of depth and floating motion, enhancing the immersive quality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does Naruto’s face retain the original number of whisker marks, eye shape, and headband position, with no distorted lines or missing features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Naruto's face is blurred in Image B, the overall positioning of the headband and other generic facial features seems to match typical Naruto representation outside of the blur zone. Therefore, no obvious disproportion or missing features are present outside the obscured feature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the action bubble placed in a visible area of the image without covering Naruto’s hand or the fusion point, and does it use consistent styling with the dialogue bubble?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The action bubbles and dialogue bubbles in Image B are coordinated in style, featuring similar speech bubble aesthetics. They are positioned to avoid obstruction of crucial visual elements such as Naruto’s hand or the energy fusion point, ensuring they remain readable and non-intrusive.",
