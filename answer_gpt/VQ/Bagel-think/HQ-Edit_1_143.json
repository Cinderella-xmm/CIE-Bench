      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features of the scientist proportionally accurate and free from exaggerated or distorted shapes such as elongated eyes, misaligned nose, or uneven lip contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scientist's facial features are not visible in detail due to the blur applied to the face. However, the remaining visible parts, like the ears and hairstyle, are stylized, suggesting a deviation from realistic proportions common in artistic illustrations or graphic designs. As a result, it is common in such illustrations for features to be stylized and not perfectly realistic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lab coat exhibit natural fabric folds and subtle shading consistent with real-world draping, without appearing uniformly flat or lacking depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a clear, artistic rendering of the lab coat, with simplified folds and shadows. The fabric folds and shading in the edited image give it a smooth and slightly stylized look without realistic texture detail. Compared to Image A, Image B appears to have a sleeker, more graphic design indicative of animated or simplified styles, resulting in less natural depth.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the pipette have exactly five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and are the joints and knuckles positioned realistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the pipette has the correct number of fingers, but the overall shape and positioning appear to have a simplified and slightly stylized form. It lacks the subtle detailing of joints and knuckles, which are important for realistic depiction, suggesting an artistic style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the test tubes display uniform liquid levels and clear glass surfaces with coherent reflections and refractions, without visible texture distortions or broken geometric outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows test tubes with straightforward and clear depiction, but they have a stylized appearance. The liquid levels are consistent, and the glass surfaces present a coherent look, but due to the stylized nature of the image, they lack the intricate glass reflexivity seen in realistic drawings, focusing on simplicity instead.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the components of the microscope and adjacent control panel correctly aligned and proportionally scaled, with no misplaced parts or floating elements that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the components related to the microscope and control panels retain a cohesive and logically structured alignment. The artistic and graphic nature preserves proportionality and consistency, similar to real-world devices, despite the stylization. There aren't any apparent floating elements or disproportionate parts.",
