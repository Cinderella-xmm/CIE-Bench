      "question": "Are the body proportions and movements in the line art consistent and natural throughout the four frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body proportions and movements are simplified into a clean line art style, focusing on key positions and motion that characterize the sport. Each frame shows slight variations in body angles and racket positioning, consistent with tennis movement sequences, maintaining natural proportions and flow. The stylization does not compromise realistic depiction of human motion. Therefore, the elimination of detailed anatomical features prioritizes clarity and simplicity, which helps deliver natural depiction.",

      "question": "Do the tennis racket and the ball retain their realistic textures and details without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the tennis racket and ball in a simplified form through line art, omitting details such as textures and distinctive features found in realistic depictions. Since the artistic style opts for minimalism, focusing on the representation rather than the detailed textures, this simplification does not introduce unnatural artifacts. As line art is intended to abstract while conveying essential visual information, it doesn't aim for realism, yet still demonstrates consistent portrayal with the sport.",

      "question": "Is the hand's position and grip on the racket depicted naturally and ergonomically in each of the four frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the placement of hands on the racket reflects typical grips used in different phases of a tennis swing. The clean line art captures basic hand positioning, with hands consistently holding the racket in a believable ergonomic manner as the player moves through the different actions. Despite the lack of detailed fingers, the depiction offers a coherent understanding of hand grips aligning with sport-specific motions.",

      "question": "Does the removal of the background and the application of monochrome colors preserve visual clarity without causing any distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B simplifies visuals by removing background details and rendering the image with monochrome line art. This approach prioritizes clarity in representing movement and positioning by eliminating distractions that could distort perception. The line art maintains essential features and movement dynamics without introducing distortion or losing key details relevant to the depicted actions, optimizing comprehension in a minimalistic format.",

      "question": "Is the sequence of actions from preparation to follow-through in the clean line art style visually coherent and believable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a sequential flow of tennis motions, where the depiction aligns logically from preparation to follow-through. Each frame shows distinctive phases of a tennis swing, captured with simplified lines that effectively communicate movement transitions. The stylized approach ensures that the sequence is both visually coherent and believable despite the absence of intricate detail, holding true to the sport's characteristic actions.",
