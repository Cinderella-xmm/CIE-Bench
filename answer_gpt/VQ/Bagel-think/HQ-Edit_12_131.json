      "question": "Do the flax fibers of the piupiu skirt and leg wraps maintain natural variation in length, thickness, and shading without appearing overly smooth or synthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flax fibers on the piupiu skirt and leg wraps show varied lengths and a natural texture, which reflects a realistic appearance familiar with traditional clothing materials. The fibers appear to have a suitable degree of shading and detail to avoid a synthetic look. Using world knowledge, traditional woven fibers like those used in such attire should have visible individual strands and a variety of dimensions making them appear natural.",

      "question": "Are the warrior’s limbs positioned naturally with correct joint alignment and muscle tension, avoiding exaggerated or impossible bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior's limbs are designed to reflect a natural stance that suggests strength and readiness, which is typical for a warrior-like pose. The arms and legs appear to be in naturally feasible positions, with the muscles and joints aligned appropriately, indicating an understanding of human anatomy and posture in illustration. Knowledge of human anatomy helps identify the correctness of limb positions in drawings.",

      "question": "Does the carved-wood title banner have realistic wood texture, proper shadowing, and edge integration with the background without appearing to float or clip unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carved-wood title banner exhibits detailed wood grain texture and appropriate shadowing, which makes the banner appear as if it is part of the scene rather than floating or poorly integrated. The rendered edges of the banner appear seamless with the background, suggesting the use of realistic graphical techniques. Knowledge of material rendering, especially in 3D graphics, emphasizes realistic texture and shadowing for such elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stat bars are clearly delineated, with visible numbers and text that do not interfere with the warrior's image or the background. They maintain an even spacing that keeps the design balanced and legible, typical of well-designed infographics or game interfaces. This aligns with the principles of design and visibility.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic frame edges showcase consistent thickness and the reflections appear to align with the scene's lighting, giving it a polished and integrated look. The curves are smooth, avoiding any pixelation or distortion that could detract from realism. Using world knowledge, well-crafted materials in image editing should exhibit uniformity and appropriate interactions with light.",
