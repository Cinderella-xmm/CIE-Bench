    "Question": "Q1: Do the luminous panels follow the exact shape and curvature of the original headâ€™s surface without visible gaps or overlapping seams?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the luminous panels appear to cover the edited head's surface smoothly without noticeable gaps or seams. The panels do align with the original structure, maintaining its contours and shape. By inspecting the edge transitions and alignments, it can be concluded that the surface treatment follows the original head shape closely.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the neon animations on the digital panels displayed with sharp, continuous light patterns and no pixelated or fragmented sections?",
    "explanation": "The neon animations on the digital panels in Image B are sharply defined, with continuous light patterns across the panels. This can be observed from the smooth contours and clear lines of illumination, avoiding any visible pixelation or fragmentation, thus ensuring consistent and sharp light display.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the synthetic foliage emit a soft, even glow from within, and do the individual plant forms have defined structure and depth without appearing like flat decals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the synthetic foliage emits a soft glow, showing an even distribution of light across the form. Each plant structure offers distinct depth and definition, evidenced by visible light and shadow play along the contours, suggesting the plants possess dimensionality rather than appearing flat.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the metallic surfaces of the surrounding buildings show accurate reflections and subtle surface variations without distorted grid patterns or stretched textures?",
    "explanation": "Examining the metallic surfaces on the buildings in Image B, they possess subtle surface variations that indicate metallic textures. Reflections across these surfaces look consistent without distorted patterns or textures that seem stretched. This fidelity in surface detail supports a realistic depiction of metallic surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the transformed head and pedestal aligned correctly with the horizon and surrounding buildings, showing no angular distortion or perspective mismatch?",
    "explanation": "The alignment of the transformed head and pedestal in Image B is consistent with the background horizon and adjacent structures. The perspective matches correctly without angular distortion, maintaining continuity with the foreground and background elements, thus integrating seamlessly within the landscape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
