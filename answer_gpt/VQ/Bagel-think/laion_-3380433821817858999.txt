    "explanation": "In Image B, the kneeling figure shows fingers positioned naturally, and there are five visible fingers on each hand. The joints appear anatomically correct, which suggests a good representation without distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the legs and torso of the leaping figure properly extended and aligned to reflect forward momentum without broken or warped limbs?",
    "explanation": "The leaping figure in Image B displays legs and a torso that appear extended and in alignment, suggesting dynamic forward movement. The limbs are portrayed without visible breaks or warping, maintaining a natural appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the knees tucked tightly toward the chest with natural curvature and no visible deformation in the leg muscles?",
    "explanation": "The leaping figure in Image B shows knees tucked toward the chest with a natural curve. There are no signs of muscle deformation, which suggests an accurate and proportionate representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the bold outlines follow the contours of the figure smoothly without jagged edges or color spillage into adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bold outlines generally follow the contours of the figure smoothly. There are no obvious jagged edges or instances where colored outlines spill into adjacent areas, indicating clean graphic work.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the text captions and step numbers positioned so they do not cover key facial features or limbs of the main figure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, text captions and step numbers are positioned thoughtfully around the main figure. They do not obstruct key facial features or limbs, ensuring the figure's main characteristics remain visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the simplified figures in each step scaled consistently with the original character and aligned in perspective?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the simplified figures are rendered with consistent scaling relative to the original character. Their alignment in perspective corresponds properly with the central theme, maintaining proportional integrity throughout the steps.",
    "answer": "Yes"
