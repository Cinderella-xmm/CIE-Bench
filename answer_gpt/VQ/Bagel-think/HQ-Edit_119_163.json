      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the cylindrical body of the tea canister proportionally consistent with the original teapot’s scale and maintains continuous, undistorted dragon engravings along its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cylindrical tea canister presents a smooth and even surface to hold the engravings similar to Image A, which features a curvaceous teapot with ornate dragon designs. The cylindrical shape is uniform and allows for a continuous portrayal of images without distortion. The engravings on the canister seem to maintain a consistent design without signs of being stretched or skewed inappropriately. Despite the shape change from spherical to cylindrical, the engravings appear well adapted to this new shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the screw cap appear seamlessly integrated with the canister body, with no visible seams or mismatched textures, and does it exhibit consistent metallic sheen and fine leaf embossing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The screw cap in Image B is smoothly attached to the canister, exhibiting a consistent metallic sheen that matches the body, suggesting harmonious material use. The leaf embossing, while not as intricate as the teapot's designs, complements the cap without visible mismatches in texture. Seamlessness is given by the continued aesthetic from the cylinder to the cap, where the design and material appear to be congruently manufactured.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"Dragon's Delight\" aligned smoothly along the spout’s curve, with legible, evenly spaced characters that do not distort the underlying metal texture or cause unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows text 'Dragoi’s Bligigit' which is misaligned not along the spout but on the cylindrical side. Additionally, the text appears distorted and spaced irregularly, suggesting editing anomalies or font choice issues, leading to a disruption of the metal texture visible through odd shading and crowding around certain parts of the text.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tea leaf logo centered on the cap’s top, rendered with clean lines and uniform depth, and free from jagged edges or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf logo is placed on the body instead of the cap and is not centered on its top. The lines of the logo do appear clean, but the placement, depth, and lighting are oriented towards the cylindrical body making its top positioning and lighting assessment inconsistent with the question's requirement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dragon engravings fully intact and evenly distributed across the cylindrical body, with no gaps, repetition, or warping that would suggest deformation during the shape conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon engravings on the cylindrical canister in Image B are evenly distributed without visible gaps or repetition, suggesting an effective resizing from the original. The curvature takes into account the cylindrical nature without warping, indicating a successful transformation while maintaining design fidelity.",
