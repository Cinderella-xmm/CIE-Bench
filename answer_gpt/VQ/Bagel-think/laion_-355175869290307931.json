      "question": "Are the lines forming the chevron pattern on the front panel evenly spaced, angularly consistent, and free from jagged edges or irregularities that suggest distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chevron pattern on the front panel of the bag appears to be uniformly spaced and angularly consistent. The lines are smooth and straight, without any jagged edges or irregularities that would indicate distortion. This consistency across the pattern suggests a clean and precise design, typical of vector or line drawings. Therefore, the pattern looks even and well-defined.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold zippers retain their linear definition and proper placement along the seams, with no misalignment or broken segments suggesting artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an illustration of the bag that includes an outline of the zippers. The illustration maintains straight and linear definitions for the zippers, following a logical path along the seam lines of the bag. There are no visible signs of misalignment or broken segments, suggesting that the depiction is consistent and without digital artifacting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the olive tone applied uniformly across the surface of the bag, with no patchy areas, color bleeding, or inconsistent saturation that suggests digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag is depicted as a drawing on the postcard, without any color fill. Therefore, the question of olive tone uniformity does not apply to a monochrome illustration, as there is no color to analyze. Given the nature of a line drawing, there are no areas to assess for patchiness, color bleeding, or saturation inconsistencies in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blank message area on the back of the postcard aligned with the dimensions of the front design, with straight edges and no visible warping or layering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The question involves evaluating the alignment of a blank message area typically found on the reverse side of a postcard. However, Image B shows only the front of a postcard with a bag illustration and does not provide a view of the back or any blank message area. Therefore, it's not possible to assess the alignment, edges, or potential errors of a non-visible message area.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the black portfolio contain the postcard with proper depth and alignment, showing no clipping, shadow mismatches, or unnatural gaps between the postcard and the portfolio walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the postcard is placed within the black portfolio. The alignment appears correct, with the postcard fitting well within the confines of the open portfolio. There are no visible signs of clipping, shadow mismatches, or gaps. The edges of the postcard look parallel to the portfolio walls, indicating proper placement and depth management.",
