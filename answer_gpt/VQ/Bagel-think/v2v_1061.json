      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the badge maintain the same level of detail and texture as the vibrant domes and intricate patterns of the building, avoiding unnatural textures or loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge is a simplified illustration with bold outlines and solid color fills, which inherently lacks the intricate details and textures seen in architectural images like those in Image A. The building inside the badge is depicted with minimal detail, focusing more on shape and color rather than intricate patterns or textures. Thus, it does not maintain the same level of detail and texture as the original vibrant domes and intricate patterns of the building in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes and proportions of the badge consistent with the architectural style of the building, ensuring no distortion or breakage of shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge features a stylized depiction of the building's architecture. The geometric shapes are simplified, with some artistic liberties taken, as is common in illustrations. However, the essential proportions and recognizable elements like the onion domes remain intact, ensuring that the architectural style is still conveyed without any apparent distortion or breakage of shapes. The illustration represents a consistent translation of the building's style into a simplified form.",

      "question": "Does the tassel material of the badge appear soft and flexible, and does the circular form look natural and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tassel appears to be part of a cartoon-like illustration rather than a photo-realistic object. While it is depicted with minimal detail, the shape is consistent with how tassels are represented in simplified artwork. The entire badge, including the circular form, maintains a smooth and natural appearance, without visible distortion. The tassel, while simple, does give the impression of softness and flexibility typical of illustrated tassels.",

      "question": "Does the hand presenting the badge have a natural appearance, with no more than five fingers, and do the lines and shapes conform to ergonomics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the badge is a simplified cartoon-style representation. It clearly has five fingers, which is standard for human hands, and the overall shape and positioning conform to ergonomic holding positions. The lines are clean and smooth, typical in cartoon drawings, and indicate a natural and believable hand pose holding the badge.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement of the badge integrate seamlessly into the image, maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility without introducing any artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge is held by a hand in a simplified cartoon style. This style inherently combines different elements in a straightforward manner. The badge's position relative to the hand appears natural and intentional, with no visual artifacts or mismatches in scale or alignment. The entire composition maintains structural coherence as expected in illustrations, ensuring visual plausibility.",
