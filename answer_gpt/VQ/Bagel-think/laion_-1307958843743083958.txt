    "Question": "Q1: Are the gold-finished surfaces of both cheetah figures smooth, reflective, and free of unnatural textures or patches that suggest digital artifacting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are two perfume bottles rather than cheetah figures. The perfume bottle surfaces are gold-finished, smooth, and reflective, typical of glass bottles, indicating no visible artifacting on the surfaces. The surfaces appear consistent with real-world objects that are typically reflective and maintain smooth appearances.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the translucent green-tinted glass façade maintain clean, continuous edges and realistic light transmission without visible distortion or abrupt transitions at its boundaries?",
    "explanation": "The green-tinted glass façade in Image B is analyzed as having clean continuous edges as typically observed in real-world glass facades. The light transmission appears realistic based on the consistent application of green tint without abrupt transitions at its boundaries.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the text 'Savanna Essence' clearly visible, correctly positioned on the base, and rendered with sharp edges and consistent font style without blurring or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text visible on the base is different than 'Savanna Essence', it appears to say 'Lauren, Lzeaes'. The font style has sharp edges and is positioned symmetrically on the bases of the perfume bottles. The text is legible and appears consistent without any signs of blurring or misalignment.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the transformed cheetah figures maintain their original sitting posture and anatomical proportions, with no visible elongation, compression, or deformation of limbs or torso?",
    "explanation": "The cheetah figures have been transformed into perfume bottles in Image B. Thus, there are no cheetahs present to assess their posture or proportions. The perfume bottles maintain a standard shape without visible elongation or deformation.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the two golden cheetah-bottle figures symmetrically aligned with the central glass façade, and do they cast consistent shadows that match the lighting direction and surface reflection?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, two perfume bottles are symmetrically aligned with the central green glass façade. The alignment looks symmetrical, and they cast shadows appropriate to the lighting direction, consistent with the interaction between light and surface reflection in real-world conditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
