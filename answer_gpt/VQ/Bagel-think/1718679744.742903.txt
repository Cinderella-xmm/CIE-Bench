    "Question": "Q5: Are the crocodile’s facial features, including the snout, teeth, and eye placement, proportionally accurate and undistorted despite the artistic modifications?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows artistic modifications with exaggerated proportions and stylization. While the facial features like the snout and eye placement adhere to this style without distortions detrimental to the overall depiction, the proportions are heightened for artistic effect rather than realistic accuracy. Therefore, the features conform to the stylized image, not a proportionally accurate rendition.",
