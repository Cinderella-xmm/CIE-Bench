      "question": "Does the man's face maintain natural proportions and avoid distortion after being converted into a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face has been converted into a 3D cartoon style. This involves stylizing features to give a more playful and animated appearance. In such stylizations, the goal is to maintain recognizable proportions of the head, even though features might appear exaggerated compared to a realistic depiction. The proportions in Image B appear consistent with common 3D cartoon interpretations where proportions are kept balanced to maintain a recognizable and expressive character, without distortion.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the fan has been depicted in a 3D cartoon style. The hand's contours, shading, and proportions appear smooth and in alignment with what is typically seen in 3D animations, where the focus is on fluidity and exaggeration while still being believable. There are no visible distortions or artifacts that suggest an unnatural appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fan in Image B is rendered in the same 3D cartoon style as the rest of the scene. It maintains its structural integrity, showing realistic interaction with its environment as portrayed in a 3D context. The fanâ€™s depiction retains its necessary details without introducing distortions or artifacts that would suggest an unnatural fit within the scene.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake and candles have been styled to match the 3D cartoon theme of the entire composition. The candles are lit, showing flames that are suited to this style while maintaining a believable appearance in relation to the cake. The cake's shape and texture are also intact, aligning with typical cartoon styling. There are no evident artifacts that disrupt their natural appearance relative to the overall artwork.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The balloons and candles set in the background of Image B are integrated into the scene in a way that complements the overall atmospheric theme of festivity. These components are styled to fit a 3D cartoon rendition, and this consistency helps ensure they blend well into the environment without breaking the natural cohesion or introducing inconsistencies.",
