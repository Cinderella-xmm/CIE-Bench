      "question": "Do the newly added chibi-style illustrations appear naturally integrated into the image without breaking the visual flow or appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style illustrations in Image B are cartoonish and vibrant, featuring smiling faces and lively designs. They maintain a consistent style with each other and are placed on a clean, light background. Given this thematic cohesion within the illustration set, they do appear to be naturally integrated with one another. Since Image A does not contain these illustrations, comparing their integration within that context isnâ€™t applicable.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the chibi-style illustrations free from unnatural textures and maintain clear details, avoiding any loss of definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustrations in Image B are cartoonish with a digital art style. The colors are solid, lines are clean, and features are distinct, indicating a high attention to detail typical of digital vector illustrations. Given this, the illustrations maintain clear details with well-defined contours.",

      "question": "Do the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi-style illustrations correctly match their surroundings, avoiding any distortion or inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi-style illustrations deliberately exaggerate proportions for effect, which is a genre-specific characteristic. Their cartoonish nature allows for freedom in design, not being bound by real-world proportions. Hence, they do not appear distorted or inconsistent within the context of their style. In Image B, they fit well within this style and are consistent in proportion among themselves.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style illustrations in Image B show expressive faces and playful poses, such as waving, akin to typical cartoon portrayals. These poses and expressions are straightforward and correlate with the cheerful demeanor that chibi illustrations usually convey.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains chibi illustrations of fruits, a cloud, and food items, which could symbolize ingredients commonly found in a cookbook or recipe notebook. The playful nature of the illustrations complements themes of fun cooking or whimsical recipe design, aligning well with such a context. They do not introduce elements that contradict their thematic purpose.",
