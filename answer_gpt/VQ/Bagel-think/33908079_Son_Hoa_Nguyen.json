      "question": "Are the hands enlarged but still anatomically correct with five fingers, natural joint positions, and no distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands appear to be cartoon-like, which gives the impression of possible enlargement. Despite this stylistic alteration, the hands do exhibit five fingers and maintain the natural joint positions typical of human anatomy. There are no evident signs of distortion like disproportionate finger lengths or awkward joint angles. Through the combination of visual cues and common anatomical knowledge, the hands are indeed enlarged but retain correct anatomical features.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the green tones in the tea field vibrant yet consistent with natural plant colors, showing smooth gradients without abrupt shifts or artificial-looking patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a highly saturated and stylized rendering of the tea field. Despite the vibrant emphasis, the color choices remain in a natural green palette reminiscent of healthy plant life. The transitions between light and shadow areas on the plants are smooth, without abrupt shifts or unexpected changes, which aligns with a stylized but recognizable form of plant coloration.",

      "question": "Does the gold foil effect on the sack’s logo appear as a smooth, reflective metallic layer without jagged edges, unnatural glare, or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sack's logo in Image B utilizes a textured, metallic gold effect. The gold foil is represented as a consistently smooth and reflective element, which does not display any jagged edges or inconsistent lighting. The reflective quality is distributed evenly, conveying a sense of metallic sheathing consistent with the appearance of gold while avoiding harsh glare or uneven patches.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the vine-patterned borders present along the edges of the image, following natural leaf and stem structures without overlapping or clipping into the main scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, decorative vine-patterned borders are clearly visible. They encapsulate the image without intruding into the central scene of the tea field and worker. The vines display typical structural features found in nature, resembling leaves and stems in a stylized manner, and they are positioned without any overlap or clipping into the main contents of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the recycled paper texture applied uniformly across the entire image without obscuring fine details such as the worker’s hair, clothing folds, or tea leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there doesn't appear to be an overt application of a recycled paper texture over the entire image. The image retains clear detail in areas such as the worker's hair and clothing as well as the precision of the tea leaves, indicating no obstruction of fine details is present from paper texturing. The uniform clarity supports the conclusion that no such texture has been applied.",
