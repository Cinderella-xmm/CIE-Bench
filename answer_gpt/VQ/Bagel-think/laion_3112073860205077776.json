    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the illustrated blueberries and text labels seamlessly integrated into the pie surface without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blueberries appear exaggerated and enhanced with vibrant colors compared to Image A. However, there is visible pixelation and jagged edges at the boundary where the pie slice is rendered, displaying inconsistencies in shadows and surface integration. The text labels also appear added rather than naturally part of the pie surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the anthropomorphic version of the mug retain the original cylindrical shape and handle position without stretching, warping, or breaking the object's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mug in Image B is indeed anthropomorphized with facial features. However, in the process of adding illustrations, its fundamental cylindrical shape and handle positioning remain consistent and unchanged compared to the original mug in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the chart positioned clearly within the frame without overlapping or obscuring the pie slice, mug, or plate, and does it have clean lines and legible text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chart uses a pastel background which is clearly separated from other objects like the slice, mug, and plate. The chart is well-positioned without overlaps, clean lines are maintained, and the text is mostly legible despite being nonsensical.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the warm pastel tones applied evenly across the scene without causing unnatural discoloration of the ceramic, glass, or baked pie surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While pastel tones are evident in the mug illustration and chart background, they do not extend to the ceramic mug, glassware, or pie slice directly. The pie slice shows enhanced colors in the fruit but not from pastel application. There is no 'warm pastel tone' applied across the entire scene, only sections.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the pie slice, mug, plate, and table maintain their original geometric forms and spatial relationships without any visible warping, fragmentation, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the anthropomorphic elements, the pie slice, mug, plate, and table all retain their original forms, shapes, and spatial relationships without visible warping, fragmentation, or misalignment when compared to Image A.",
