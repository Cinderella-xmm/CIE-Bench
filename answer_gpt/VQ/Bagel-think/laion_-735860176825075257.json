      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the rooflines, gables, and timber framing sharply defined and angular without rounded or blurred transitions that contradict the paper-cut style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure has been edited to mimic a paper-cut style. This style typically features sharp, angular edges that reflect the precision of paper cuts. However, upon reviewing the image, the lines of the rooflines, gables, and timber framing appear slightly blurred and not sharply angular, which contradicts the typical paper-cut style known for its sharpness.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold foil accents on the window frames and flower box edges appear uniformly applied with consistent reflectivity and no pixelated or smudged textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible gold foil accents present on the window frames or flower box edges. The windows and edges bear a simple color-like effect that lacks any metallic sheen or reflective property that gold foil would exhibit. Additionally, there is no indication of pixelated or smudged textures typically associated with improper foil rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the crimson color of the entrance awning evenly distributed and consistent with the lighting direction, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows a crimson entrance awning, but upon closer examination, the color does not demonstrate an even application. There are inconsistencies in shading and color depth that do not align with the lighting direction typically expected in a realistic or paper-cut style representation. These abrupt shifts suggest an uneven and unnatural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric arch borders cleanly aligned with the edges of the image and do they not overlap or distort any part of the building's structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric arch borders are applied throughout the image to fit the various elements including the facade of the building. However, looking closely, there appear to be alignments that are not perfectly flush with the edges of the structures, indicating some overlaps or minor distortions with the building's visual presentation.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edge of the image appear clean and continuous without visible clipping, jagged lines, or missing pixels that suggest improper trimming or rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The border of Image B is styled in a decorative manner, typical of a paper-cut art form. While largely clean in its continuity, there are sections around the border—particularly near detailed intersections—that exhibit minor jagged lines or areas where precision trimming appears suboptimal. These observations suggest slight imperfections in the image rendering or trimming process.",
