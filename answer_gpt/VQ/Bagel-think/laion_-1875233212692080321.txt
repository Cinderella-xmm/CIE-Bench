    "Question": "Q1: Is the glass bottle positioned such that its base aligns with the original location of the rose petals and does not appear disproportionately large or small compared to surrounding elements?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the visual cues on the lower part of the image do not indicate any glass bottle, rose petals, or their relative size compared to surrounding elements. This suggests that no such alignment exists or is visible in the edited state.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the petal etchings on the bottle surface continuous and evenly spaced, without visible gaps, pixelation, or irregular line breaks?",
    "explanation": "There is no visible glass bottle surface containing etchings of petals in the edited image. Therefore, it is not possible to observe any continuous or evenly spaced etchings to evaluate.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the gold rose-shaped cap exhibit realistic reflections and specular highlights that match the light source direction and do not appear overly shiny or uniformly colored?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no visible gold rose-shaped cap, thus making it impossible to assess the presence or quality of reflections or highlights.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the deep crimson gradient inside the bottle smoothly blended across the vertical axis, without visible color bands or uneven transitions?",
    "explanation": "The edited image does not include visuals of a gradient inside a bottle, as any potential gradients or color transitions in that aspect are not discernible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the vertical gold logo clearly legible, evenly spaced, and aligned along the side of the bottle without warping, fading, or overlapping with other elements?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no visible vertical gold logo, thus making it impossible to evaluate its legibility, spacing, or alignment along the bottle.",
    "answer": "No"
