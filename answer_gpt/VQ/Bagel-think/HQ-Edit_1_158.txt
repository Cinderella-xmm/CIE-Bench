    "Question": "Q1: Does the silhouette of the woman maintain correct anatomical proportions and avoid geometric distortions such as misaligned limbs, unnatural bends, or missing body parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the woman is represented in a stylized and simplified manner, consistent with line drawing or stencil art. Despite the absence of realistic detail, her limbs and body parts display uniformity and coherence within the style used. There are no visible unnatural bends or misalignments in the depiction of her arms, shoulders, or body. The style intentionally abstracts natural forms, yet maintains integrity within its artistic constraints.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the enlarged book proportionally consistent with the womanâ€™s hands and arms, and does it not appear to float or clip through the chair or body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the book is drawn to suit the artistic style of the overall image. It is central to the woman's body and appears proportionate relative to her hand representation, maintaining a visual balance expected in this simplified style. Although detail alignment and spatial precision aren't as literal due to the artistic nature, the book appears fixed and integrated, with no evident floating or clipping issues.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the lace details on the sweater seamlessly integrated with the original knit texture, showing no signs of unnatural edges, repeating patterns, or material inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses a consistent line style for depicting the intricate designs of the sweater, suggesting lace patterns through repeated motifs and decorations. This consistency in texture and design maintains the overall stylistic integrity, preventing any unnatural edges or repeating patterns that look out of place within the image's artistic language. The stylization unifies the depiction across the entire garment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the simplified bookshelves maintain coherent shelf structure with aligned edges and realistic spacing between books, avoiding floating or misaligned elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the books and shelves are represented in an abstract manner. The depiction retains structured lines that denote shelf edges and books placed horizontally, with spacing illusions suggested rather than depicted. This aligns with the visual style which abstracts realistic texture and alignment for a more artistic illustration, eliminating clear errors like floating or misalignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the antique-gold cardstock background uniformly textured and lit, with no abrupt edges or lighting mismatches that separate it from the central figure and other elements?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a consistent use of color and texture throughout the depicted background which appears as an antique-gold design. This background is uniformly applied with minimal variance in tone, and smoothly integrates with the central figure and other design elements. This seamlessness avoids abrupt edges or lighting mismatches, maintaining the stylistic coherence typical for such art.",
    "answer": "Yes"
