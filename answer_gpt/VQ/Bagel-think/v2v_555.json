      "question": "Does the snow globe surrounding the latte art appear structurally coherent without distorting the Colosseum and Big Ben designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Colosseum and Big Ben have been transformed into miniature models placed inside snow globes. The snow globe structure does not introduce distortion to these designs. The Colosseum has a distinct and recognizable architecture with arches that are clearly defined, and Big Ben maintains its iconic clock face and tower structure. The snow globes complement the structures without altering their inherent shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any visible unnatural textures or artifacts where the latte art transitions into the snow globe's glass surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass surface of the snow globes appears smooth and clear, with no visible seams or artifacts at the boundaries of the latte art areas. The transition seems well-executed, maintaining a realistic glass look with no unnatural textures present. The glass reflects light naturally and contains well-blended snowflakes inside, contributing to a coherent look.",

      "question": "Do the miniature versions of the Colosseum and Big Ben inside the snow globe maintain their correct proportions and avoid appearing distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the Colosseum and Big Ben have been miniaturized but maintain their original proportions. The architectural features such as arches of the Colosseum and details of Big Ben like the clock and tower are accurately represented, indicating that the proportions are preserved without distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the snowflakes in the snow globe add to the charm of the winter scene without obscuring or degrading the fine details of the Colosseum and Big Ben?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, snowflakes are visible suspended inside the globes, enhancing the winter scene. They are well-distributed and do not cover or obscure critical details of the Colosseum or Big Ben, such as the arches and clock face. The snowflakes contribute to the aesthetic without interfering with the clarity of the miniature replicas.",

      "question": "Is the background of the edited image softly blurred with a cozy café atmosphere that complements the snow globe without introducing inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a warm, softly blurred setting that resembles a cozy café atmosphere, suitable for displaying snow globes. The blurred lights add a bokeh effect, offering continuity and complementing the snow globes without conflicting elements or inconsistency in the scene presentation.",
