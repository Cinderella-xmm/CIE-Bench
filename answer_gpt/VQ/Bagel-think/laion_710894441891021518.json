    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the butterfly wings formed from the branches have smooth, continuous outlines without visible breaks, warping, or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the wings exhibit a smooth outline that follows a realistic pattern for butterfly wings, which indicates a high level of artistry and attention to detail. The continuity of the wing's edges shows that they were edited with care to avoid breaks or warping, which is consistent with a professional transformation of an organic structure. Common artistic practices ensure that the wings appear seamless and natural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the luminescent patterns on the butterfly wings evenly distributed with soft edges and no visible digital artifacts like halos or sharp contrast jumps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminescent patterns on the butterfly wings are skillfully integrated, displaying an understanding of light diffusion and color blending. The edges of the luminescent spots are soft and gradual, suggesting an intended stylistic choice. This reflects a careful design process aimed at preserving natural realism without introducing unwanted digital artifacts.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glowing eyes and antlers positioned in a way that respects the original branching structure, with no unnatural overlaps or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays glowing eyes and antlers, which are integrated into the structure of the figure, forming organic extensions from a central part, without any hovering or displaced elements. The placement is coherent with the overall design of the character, adhering to the natural flow and positioning expected of such artistic interpretations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stone base retain natural stone texture, including subtle variations in color and surface depth, without appearing uniformly flat or artificially rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the texture of the stone base appears textured with intricate detail rather than flat, which should ideally mirror genuine stone characteristics such as subtle variations in color and surface irregularity. The natural appearance suggests a thoughtful approach to maintaining an authentic stone feel, depicting what might be expected in a real life stone sculpture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bark-like textures on the trunk flow continuously along its contours without sudden breaks, unnatural ridges, or inconsistent scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B focuses on the fantastical and edited components, there is an opportunity to assess the overall integration of the textures of the sculpture. However, the trunk-like features are transformed into stone-like textures, which is a shift from the original tree bark appearance, making this question application inappropriate without reference to the original bark.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the remaining leaves, soil, and root structures clearly visible and undistorted, with no blurring, loss of edge definition, or missing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus on the fantastical transformation does not include the leaves, soil, or roots as seen in Image A. Image A reveals a bonsai plant with detailed foliage, but any comparison here is not fully applicable due to the transformed nature of Image B.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements cast subtle ambient light on nearby surfaces, and do shadows from the wings, eyes, and antlers align with the sceneâ€™s lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing elements, especially the eyes and parts of the wings, seem to visually suggest ambient light emission, yet the overall integration into the scene involves a consistent lighting scheme, aligning shadows with the lighting direction. Such effects simulate natural reactions within an illuminated environment.",
