      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the shrimp character’s arm and hand have five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and are they attached at a logical joint point without deforming the shrimp’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp character's arms and hands are highly stylized and cartoonish. The hand does not feature five fingers with typical human anatomy curvature and spacing. The connection points between the arms and the body of the shrimp are exaggerated and do not follow anatomical norms plausible for a shrimp or even a cartoonish representation that maintains logical structure. This is evident as the arms appear more stick-like and simplistic than anatomically detailed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chef’s hat cast a subtle shadow on the shrimp and have visible fabric texture and creases consistent with real-world materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chef's hat is illustrated in a cartoonish style without noticeable texture or creases typical of real-world fabric. The design is simplified, and the lack of detail such as stitching or visible texture means there are no shadows cast consistent with those details. The hat's portrayal is more focused on recognizable shape rather than realistic material detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand gripping the lemon slice positioned with fingers properly curved and spaced, and does the lemon retain its natural wedge shape and surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given Image B, the representation is heavily cartoonish, and thus it does not feature an anatomically correct hand holding a lemon slice. The hands shown are simplistic and lack detailed curvature or spacing normally found on an anatomically correct hand. There is no lemon slice represented in Image B as the scene depicts a shrimp character rather than a realistic culinary setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the motion lines aligned with the shrimp’s direction of movement and do the herb particles appear to be dispersing from a logical origin point near the shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, motion lines are used to convey movement in a cartoonish manner, aligned with the shrimp character's movements for emphasis. However, herb particles or similar motifs are not clearly visible in a way that signifies dispersal due to movement. The focus in Image B is more on the shrimp character's expressive portrayal rather than realistic culinary preparation details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shrimp tails arranged in a stable, gravity-consistent pile with overlapping layers and no floating or suspended pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a traditional culinary arrangement of shrimp tails. Instead, the shrimp bodies are depicted engaging in exaggerated, expressive actions typical of comic art. Gravity consistency, like stable piling, is not a concern within this artistic style as it serves the narrative and comedic effect rather than realistic representation.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all text elements clearly legible, positioned without overlapping key visual elements, and rendered with consistent stroke thickness and style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is stylized to follow the comic's exaggerated aesthetic. The humorous font and positioning do impair legibility as seen in text overlapping within speech bubbles. The font stroke is inconsistent visually reflecting a cartoon style more than clarity or uniformity. The artistic choice impacts readability but aligns with comedic presentation.",
