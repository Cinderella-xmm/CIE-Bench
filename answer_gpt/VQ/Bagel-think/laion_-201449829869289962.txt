    "Question": "Q1: Does the dome glass case show smooth transparency with realistic light interaction and no visible stitching or warping around the edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome covering the model exhibits smooth and clear transparency. The light interaction on the glass appears natural, suggesting realistic light refraction and reflection. There are no visible signs of stitching or warping around the edges of the dome, which indicates the editing was well-executed to simulate the appearance of a real glass dome.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the dimensions of the church tower, roof, and adjacent buildings proportionally consistent with one another as if reduced uniformly?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the church tower, roof, and adjacent buildings are miniaturized within the dome. They appear to be appropriately scaled down with consistent proportions among the different structures. This uniform scaling enhances the realism of the diorama, convincing the viewer of a real reduced-world scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the newly added small houses aligned with the original architectural style and do they have correctly shaped roofs, windows, and textures without deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the small houses surrounding the dome follow the architectural style seen in the central church structure, with similar roof shapes and window designs. The textures of these houses appear consistent without noticeable deformation, supporting the impression of a cohesive miniature village.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the copper roof on the church tower display realistic texture variations, oxidation effects, and lighting response consistent with real copper?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the copper roof on the church tower shows some color variants that mimic natural oxidation effects seen in real copper over time. The lighting reflects off the surface realistically, aligning with the expected behavior of light on a metal surface. This gives it a convincing appearance of a genuine copper finish.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the mist along the distant mountains smoothly diffused with gradual opacity changes and no abrupt edges or blocky patterns?",
    "explanation": "The mist in Image B over the distant mountains is applied with a gentle gradient, showing gradual changes in opacity. There are no harsh lines or blocky patterns, suggesting a smooth and natural diffusion, successfully simulating atmospheric perspective",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the gold pedestal positioned directly under the base of the diorama and does it have a solid, grounded appearance with no floating or misaligned parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold pedestal is placed directly beneath the diorama. The alignment appears correct, with no indication of the structure floating or any misalignment. This results in a sturdy and stable appearance, lending credibility to the model's presentation as a decorative object.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the terraced vineyards show consistent spacing and natural curvature without visible grid lines or pixelated edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the terraced vineyards are rendered with consistent spacing along the slopes, with smooth and natural curves characteristic of real terraced landscapes. There are no visible grid lines or pixelated edges, contributing to a realistic representation of vineyard patterns.",
    "answer": "Yes"
