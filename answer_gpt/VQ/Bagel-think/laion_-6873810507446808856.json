      "question": "Are the eyes added to the pancake surfaces positioned symmetrically and proportionally consistent with the size and shape of the pancakes, without deforming the surrounding texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are exaggerated cartoon eyes placed on the pancakes. The eyes are symmetrically positioned towards the center-top area of each pancake stack, aligning with typical cartoon character design that keeps facial features centered for appeal. Moreover, the eyes do not disturb the texture of the pancakes, as they seem to be added on top without compromising the pancake's characteristic fluffiness seen from the edges. This indicates skillful placement ensuring consistency and proportion without deformation. World knowledge of cartoon art styles supports this placement approach for staying proportional.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the butter pat still recognizable as a solid block with clean edges and natural lighting, even after being stylized as a hat, without exhibiting warped or fragmented geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butter pat on top of the pancakes has been altered significantly as the pancakes themselves are stylized cartoon characters without any butter block resembling hat elements present. Image B fully transitions the classic pancake and butter concept into cartoon form, omitting the butter block entirely. Without direct representation or stylized version of the butter, no clean edges or recognizable solidity of butter can be evaluated unless it is a direct element of the character. Previously in Image A, the butter is clear, solid, reflecting natural light, while this is absent in the cartoon depiction of Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the syrup stream extend downward from the pancake stack in a continuous, smooth arc without abrupt breaks, pixelation, or unnatural viscosity that contradicts liquid behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a pancake within comic frames, eliminating any conventional portrayal of syrup streams like in Image A. Instead, the narrative focuses on cartoon pancakes immersed in blue water-like texture signifying comedic and alternative syrup representation. In Image A, the syrup stream is fluid, consistent, and natural, which is absent in the edited image, replaced by distinct blue contexts for humor and creativity, highlighting contrast with syrup consistency standards seen commonly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the added breakfast items (e.g., coffee cups, scrambled eggs) aligned with the depth and lighting of the original scene, maintaining consistent shadows and scale relative to the pancake stack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the breakfast scene is transformed into a cartoon format incorporating items like coffee cups alongside the animated pancakes. These elements blend within cartoon logic, lacking the photorealistic depth and lighting seen in Image A. The cartoon depiction doesn't maintain the realistic shadow scale present in real photography yet aligns well with the stylized narrative. Image A shows real breakfast items harmoniously fitting toward depth harmonious with lighting, contrasting with the edited cartoon scene's singular artistic shadows.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the speech bubbles and text boxes positioned in open areas of the frame without overlapping critical elements such as the pancake stack or syrup stream, and do they have clear, legible letterforms without jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image is a comic-style illustration with speech bubbles strategically placed around the pancake characters, ensuring the eyes and visible pancake features remain unobstructed. The text within these bubbles is stylized and concise, contrasting with conventional legibility styles but maintaining character consistency without jagged edges. While unconventional lettering fits cartoon tropes, placement maintains open areas, aligning with visual aesthetics of comic panels. Unlike Image A, which represents photographic clarity without speech elements, Image B ensures designed correspondence and retains clarity necessary for cartoon comprehension.",
