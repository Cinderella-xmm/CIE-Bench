    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the 3D ballerina figure inside the snow globe maintain anatomically correct proportions and joint alignment, matching the original dancer's pose without exaggerated or broken limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ballerina's pose inside the snow globe appears anatomically correct. The limbs are proportionate, and the posture mirrors a typical ballet pose, suggesting a realistic and natural form. There are no broken or exaggerated parts, indicating a faithful representation of a dancer without anatomical distortion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the base of the snow globe display realistic bronze texture with subtle reflective highlights and clearly defined engraved French script, without pixelation or synthetic-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the snow globe shows a bronze texture with a sheen that matches the characteristics of metal, implying a high-quality finish. The French script appears crisp and legible, indicating precise engraving rather than pixelation or blurred synthetic patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the snowflakes inside the globe evenly dispersed and varied in shape and size, appearing to float naturally without repeating patterns or clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowflakes are scattered within the globe, and show diversity in form and dimension, giving the impression of natural randomness and motion. There are no visible patterns or clusters, enhancing the realistic depiction of a snow globe effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the Eiffel Tower and surrounding Parisian landmarks scaled down appropriately and geometrically intact, maintaining correct perspective and structural details without warping or flattening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Eiffel Tower and other landmarks are miniaturized within the snow globe but maintain accurate proportions and structural integrity. The elements reflect proper geometric perspective, appearing realistic and undistorted as miniature replicas.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the glass dome of the snow globe exhibit natural refraction and subtle bending of internal elements, with smooth curvature and no jagged edges or abrupt transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome's curvature is smooth and consistent, causing expected slight optical distortion of the snow globe contents, which implies natural refraction. There are no sharp transitions or uneven edges, maintaining the visual integrity of the dome.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
