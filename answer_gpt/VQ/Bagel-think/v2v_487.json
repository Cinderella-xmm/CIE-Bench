      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style figure appear to seamlessly emerge from the kayak without any visible breaks or unnatural intersections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the 3D chibi figure seems to be placed on the skateboard rather than the kayak, and there are no visible breaks or intersections that would provide continuity with the kayak. The figure is layered on top of the scene in a 2D photograph style, suggesting it is not emerging from the kayak. Therefore, it doesn't show any signs of emerging from the kayak.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or artifacts present around the edges where the chibi figure meets the kayak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure is placed beside the kayak with the figure sitting on the skateboard. The integration of the chibi figure into the Polaroid-style photo shows clean edges without noticeable artifacts or unnatural textures at the intersection. The visual placement appears carefully done to avoid such issues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the chibi figure relative to the kayak appear realistic and maintain structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure appears disproportionate compared to real-world human proportions relative to a kayak. The figure is cartoonishly large compared to the kayak, a common trait of chibi-style figures meant to exaggerate features, leading to an unrealistic yet stylistically consistent portrayal. Thus, it does not reflect realistic proportions, yet it maintains consistency within its fictional and stylistic context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the Polaroid photograph holding the scene appear naturally integrated into the overall composition without any distortion or unnatural placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a Polaroid photograph effect that encapsulates the chibi figure, kayak, and skateboard. The photograph appears to be held by fingers at the bottom left, which integrates naturally into the overall composition. Thereâ€™s no evident distortion or awkward placement, and the items within the Polaroid maintain a coherent visual alignment with the frame.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the materials and textures of the kayak and skateboard remained consistent and undistorted after the addition of the chibi figure and Polaroid frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the materials and textures of both the kayak and skateboard appear to remain unchanged upon the addition of the chibi figure and Polaroid frame. The kayak maintains its yellow hue and visible bungee detailing, while the skateboard retains its wooden deck and wheels. These elements do not show any signs of distortion due to the integration of new elements.",
