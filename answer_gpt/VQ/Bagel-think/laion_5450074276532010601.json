      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the red helmet and blue cap on the paddles maintain proportional size relative to the paddle heads and avoid stretching or warping the underlying rubber surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual representation of the helmet and cap added atop the paddles appears to keep the shapes proportional relative to the paddle heads. analyzing the integration of these accessories with the rubber surface, there is no evident distortion in the rubber surface. Such proportional design typically indicates a coherent manipulation where accessories are placed in a manner that respects the original object's surface properties. Hence, the added graphics do not seem to warp the paddles, and the dimensions of the helmet and cap align well with the dimensions of the paddle heads.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cartoon facial features and accessories on the paddles seamlessly integrated with no visible stitching, sharp edges, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon facial features on the paddles in Image B exhibit sharp outlines and clear shading techniques that match the overall art style. While observing these elements, there are no abrupt edges or misalignment apparent, suggesting cohesive integration. The shading seems to be consistently applied across the graphics, exemplifying a smooth transition without visible disruptions. This typically denotes an advanced level of graphic manipulation where additions appear seamless and natural with the existing image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the golden edges confined to the perimeter of the box lid and base, without extending into the interior or forming disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the golden edges are visually placed along the periphery of the box lid and base. They are confined exclusively to the box's border without extending onto the interior contents or creating discontinuous segments. Given the consistent width and placement around the edges, there is no visual intrusion into the box's interior space, which confirms a well-defined boundary typically seen in advanced design aesthetics to maintain cleanliness and organization in design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the speech bubbles have pointed tails directed toward the paddles and avoid overlapping with the box or paddle handles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts speech bubbles containing pointed tails that are actionably directed towards the paddles. The alignment and positioning avoid any visual overlap with the box or its paddle handles. The directionality of speech bubble tails, as seen here, provides clarity of communication and is a common graphic strategy to indicate origin of dialogue without cluttering other elements. The deliberate avoidance of overlapping ensures coherence in layout, optimizing visual hierarchy.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the treasure map background composed of uniformly drawn lines with no pixelation, aliasing, or irregular stroke widths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portrayal of a treasure map background consists of lines that seem uniformly drawn with consistent stroke widths. The examination for pixelation or aliasing reveals a smooth graphical presentation without noticeable jagged edges or inconsistencies. Regularity in line drawing suggests high-quality graphic rendering, where artistic coherence and precision are achieved without any disruptive artifacts like uneven stroke or pixel anomalies typically found in less refined designs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the paddles tilted upward from the box but still supported by the handle slots, maintaining structural plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The paddles in Image B appear tilted upwards but remain positioned within the handle slots. This orientation creates a visual effect of elevation while still preserving plausible structural support. The observed alignment ensures the handles are adequately resting within the designated slots, which corroborates the realism of the placement, maintaining practical feasibility consistent with how such items might be realistically arranged in packaging.",
