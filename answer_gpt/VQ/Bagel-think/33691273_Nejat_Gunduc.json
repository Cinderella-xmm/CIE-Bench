    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the man’s head position and hand placement near his ear form a plausible and anatomically correct pose that conveys a contemplative state without distortion or unnatural joint angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's head position is slightly angled, and his hand is placed near his ear. This posture is commonly associated with a contemplative or thoughtful state. The angles of the arm and head appear natural, without any apparent distortion or uncomfortable joint angles, which indicates a well-constructed pose.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the new background elements (urban structures, lighting, and text) visually consistent with the monochrome tone and do they blend naturally without abrupt edges or conflicting textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, urban structures and text are incorporated into the monochrome setting. The elements feature clear lines consistent with the graphic style, and the lighting effect is evenly distributed, avoiding abrupt transitions. The textures of the urban elements integrate seamlessly with the monochrome aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the thought bubbles properly aligned with the man’s head, drawn with consistent line quality, and free from pixelation or overlapping distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thought bubbles are positioned in a way that visually aligns with the man's head as if suggesting his thought process, with consistent line quality without visible pixelation or distortion. They are drawn cleanly, adhering to the stylistic blending intended in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the man’s figure cast a consistent shadow or interact with the billboard surface in a way that preserves spatial depth and avoids floating or disconnected appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man seems integrated into the scene, which includes a Coca-Cola billboard. While shadows are not overtly visible in Image B, the integration and spatial depth are preserved effectively by the graphic treatment and positioning, avoiding a disconnected or 'floating' appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the man’s knit cap, jacket, and facial features preserved with clear definition and no visible artifacting or over-smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although textural details are simplified to fit the artistic comic style, the knit cap and jacket maintain clear definition and consistent shading without visible artifacting. The translated features reflect a monochrome, illustrative approach suited for comic imagery and do not suffer from over-smoothing typical of poor-quality edits.",
