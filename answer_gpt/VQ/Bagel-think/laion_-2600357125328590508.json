      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the LEGO brick structures aligned with the original sockâ€™s contours, maintaining consistent proportions and avoiding warped or stretched geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO brick structures are depicted as forming a sock with clearly defined contours. The geometry of the LEGO bricks is consistent, and the arrangement maintains the natural proportions of a sock, avoiding any warping or stretching of the structure. The visual cues suggest that the aligned bricks closely mimic the contours of a standard sock. In Image A, the original sock's contours are straightforward, which assists in affirming that Image B effectively replicates these contours using bricks.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the layered LEGO bricks follow the natural curves of the sock, forming a cohesive 3D structure without gaps or misaligned layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks appear to be layered in a way that follows the natural curves of what is expected in a sock structure. The arrangement is coherent and forms a 3D structure without visible gaps between layers or any misalignment. The structure is seamless, with each layer fitting with the next, forming an overall smooth appearance reflective of a sock.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the black, gray, and white LEGO bricks arranged to match the original sock's pattern layout, including the \"UNO\" text and accent stripes, without color inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks are color-coded in black, gray, and white, mirroring the pattern layout of the original sock in Image A. The deliberate placement of different colored bricks helps replicate the 'UNO' text and pattern stripes accurately. The consistent use of these colors throughout the structure prevents mismatches and ensures that the sock pattern is maintained without color inconsistency.",

      "question": "Is the orange LEGO piece positioned at the top of the cuff and integrated into the brick structure without floating or unnatural attachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange LEGO piece is seen at the top of the sock cuff, signifying the spot where it is supposed to be placed. It is integrated into the overall structure suggestively, without showing any signs of floating or unnatural attachment. This integration implies a deliberate design choice that reflects the original design shown in Image A with its orange tag on the top of the sock.",

      "question": "Is the sculpture presented upright against a clean, uniform background with even lighting that highlights its 3D form without casting unnatural shadows or reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO sculpture of the sock is presented upright against a clean and uniform background. The lighting effectively highlights the sock's 3D form, accentuating its depth without causing any unnatural shadows or reflections. This presentation style is similar to Image A, where similar attention is paid to bringing out the details of the product through lighting and background choice.",
