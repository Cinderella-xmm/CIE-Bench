      "question": "Does the dancer’s raised leg and arm maintain natural human proportions and joint alignment despite the stylized design, with no visible geometric distortion or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained glass style depicts the dancer with a focus on stylization commonly seen in such art. The proportions and alignment of the raised leg and arm appear consistent with this style, as joint alignment and human proportion are preserved within artistic norms, indicating no visible distortion or unnatural bending.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the dancer’s dress and accessories composed of smooth, continuous lines and uniform color segments without jagged edges or fragmented areas indicating texture errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's stained glass representation utilizes smooth lines typical of stained glass, with uniform color segments delineated by bold outlines that are characteristic of this medium, resulting in no indication of jagged edges or texture errors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the huts and trees in the background exhibit smooth, curved forms consistent with Art Nouveau aesthetics, without distorted silhouettes or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements such as huts and trees are designed with flowing, curvilinear lines that mirror the Art Nouveau aesthetic. The silhouettes maintain their intended forms, without signs of distortion or collapsing, aligning with the style's emphasis on graceful lines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the color gradient across the sky and ground consistent with a soft, iridescent glass effect, showing no harsh boundaries or artificial highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stained glass technique employed in Image B showcases a color gradient particularly in the sky, which is smooth and emulates the soft transitions found in iridescent glass. This consistency ensures an absence of harsh boundaries or artificial highlights, supporting its artistic effect.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the cloth display five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and does it interact realistically with the fabric without clipping or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of the hand in Image B, within the stained glass style, shows clearly defined fingers that, although stylized, do not appear to clip or float in relation to the cloth. The interaction suggests that the design maintains logical physical interactions with the fabric.",
