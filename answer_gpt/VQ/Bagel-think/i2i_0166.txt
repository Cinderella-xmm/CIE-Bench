    "Question": "Q1: Does the added poem text blend naturally with the image without causing any visible distortion to the background or bird?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the poem text is located in the bottom right of the image and does not interfere with the items of primary focus, namely the bird and the branch. Visually, the text appears as having been added in post-production without altering the image itself, given that the entities it potentially overlaps with, like the background blur, remain unaffected by it. Hence, there is no distortion caused to either the background or the bird.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the poem text appear in a position that does not obscure important elements like the bird or branch, ensuring structural consistency?",
    "explanation": "The text in Image B is positioned at the bottom right corner, where it does not cover significant elements like the bird or the branch. Given the layout, the poem text lies outside of the birdâ€™s immediate area on the left and the branch's core visibility line. With a strategic placement that does not interfere with primary subjects, it ensures structural consistency of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

It is significant enough to be read comfortably without drawing undue attention away from the primary focus, the bird. Thus, it maintains good balance alongside readability.",

The text appears smooth and consistent under the lighting conditions evident within the image and does not introduce any unwanted artifacts. Therefore, the texture aligns well with the image's lighting without being disruptive.",
