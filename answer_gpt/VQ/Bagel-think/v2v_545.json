      "question": "Does the sparrow maintain its natural proportions and texture details without appearing overly stylized or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow appears highly stylized, resembling a 3D render rather than a real-life counterpart. The details and textures are overly smoothed, which is typical in digital renderings, causing it to lose the intricate feather patterns and realistic detailing seen in nature. This effect creates a cartoonish or artificial appearance rather than maintaining natural proportions and textures.",

      "question": "Does the sparrow appear to be perched naturally on the wooden chair without any distortion or unnatural positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow is positioned centrally on top of the chair back, maintaining a naturally perched stance, typical for small birds. This suggests that the spatial relationship between the sparrow's body and its contact with the chair is correct, without any awkward angles or distortions. The posture reflects a believable depiction consistent with real-life perching behavior.",

      "question": "Does the wooden chair exhibit realistic wood grain and texture without any unnatural artifacts or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the chair looks convincingly shaped, the fine grain and texture details are simplified, similar to stylized 3D models. The realistic intricacies commonly found in wood, such as subtle grain lines and natural imperfections, seem minimized, affecting the realism. It lacks the complexity seen in real wooden objects, reflecting a more idealized smooth surface typical of CGI renderings.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the sparrow and the chair consistent and natural, contributing to the overall realism of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting seems uniform, but the shadows and highlights on the sparrow and the chair do not exhibit subtle gradations seen in natural light settings. The lighting lacks depth and does not create realistic shadows or textures.. Natural lighting usually displays more varied shadowing dependent on surfaces and angles, which seems absent here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the sparrow and the chair look visually credible and undistorted in the 3D-rendered depiction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Regarding Image B, the composition of the sparrow perched atop the chair follows natural proportions, with both elements properly aligned and fitting within a believable spatial relationship. Despite the stylization, the layout of the sparrow on the chair appears coherent without distortion. This arrangement aids in maintaining the visual credibility intact.",
