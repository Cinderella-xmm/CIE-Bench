    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the golden title banner positioned at the top of the image without overlapping or distorting the cat’s head or the window frame, and does it have a natural metallic sheen that matches the ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden title banner is placed above the cat and window frame without any overlap on the cat's head or the window, maintaining clear separation between the foreground and background objects. The sheen on the banner appears metallic and fits well with the soft lighting present in the scene, showing knowledge of design principles where ambient light should harmonize with added graphic elements.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the nameplate located at the bottom of the image without intersecting or deforming the cat’s tail or the wooden floor, and does it have clean edges and consistent material texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nameplate is positioned at the bottom, not interfering with the visual appearance of the cat’s tail or the wooden floor. It exhibits clean edges and consistent material texture, indicative of the designer’s careful integration respecting the scene's spatial boundaries and maintaining a distinct separation between in-scene objects and overlays.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the stat bars clearly visible and positioned without overlapping the cat’s fur or the window, and do they use a font and color scheme that match the overall polished, soft 3D art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stat bars in Image B are visible and placed to avoid clashing or overlapping with the cat’s fur or the window. The font and color scheme used for these bars blend seamlessly with the soft, polished 3D style seen throughout the image, which demonstrates a consistent design approach where typography and color scheme harmonize with the 3D aesthetic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the metallic trim form a complete, continuous border around the image without gaps, misaligned corners, or unnatural reflections that contradict the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a metallic trim surrounding the frame, forming an uninterrupted and continuous border. It shows no gaps or misaligned corners, and the reflections on the trim follow the lighting direction within the scene, indicating adherence to visual consistency and realistic rendering of light interacting with metal surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall image rendered in a consistent semi-realistic 3D style where the cat’s fur, window details, and added elements like the banner and stat bars all exhibit smooth textures and no pixelation, blurring, or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall rendering in Image B maintains a semi-realistic 3D style with smooth textures across the cat’s fur, window details, and all added elements like the banner and stat bars. The image shows no signs of pixelation, blurring, or geometric distortions, reflecting an understanding of consistent rendering practices in digital art where all components exhibit the visual and textural fluidity expected in high-quality 3D renderings.",
