        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plastic figurine in Image B resembles a superhero with well-defined muscular build and proportional limbs, characteristic of such characters.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figurine holding a hammer with discernible fingers gripping the handle. The hand retains a natural shape with a proper number of fingers (five) on visible examination, and there's no apparent ergonomic distortion or breakage in the hand's structure.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The head structure of the figurine in Image B maintains a form consistent with typical superhero figurines, with strong and sharp features.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor and cape are consistent with the superhero aesthetic, matching classic character designs with metallic and fabric elements. The textures of the armor retain a metallic sheen, and the cape flows naturally downwards. These elements cohesively blend with the figurine's body, ensuring visual plausibility without any discordant textural elements.",
