      "question": "Do the sugar-coated machines retain their original geometric shapes and proportions without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the machines are visually altered with a candy theme, their fundamental geometric shapes and proportions remain intact. The structural outlines of machinery components are similar to those in Image A, indicating that despite their visual alteration, the original shapes haven't been distorted. They retain their angles, symmetry, and alignments, fitting the context of a whimsical candy factory theme.",

      "question": "Does the texture and color of the gingerbread walls look natural and free from unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the walls appear to have a gingerbread design superimposed over the original brick texture. However, the superimposition results in an unnatural appearance, as the change introduces a clearly digital effect that stands out against the rest of the image. This does not entirely mimic a realistic gingerbread texture, resulting in noticeable artifacts and a lack of immersion.",

      "question": "Is the river of flowing chocolate smooth and visually plausible without disrupting the scene's structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the river of chocolate visually cuts through the floor area but does not seamlessly integrate with the structure of the scene. It appears more like an overlay on top of the original image rather than a natural component of it. The lack of interaction with the floor and other elements disrupts the structural coherence of the scene, making it visually implausible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the lollipops and candy canes on the ceiling trusses integrated naturally without introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows candy canes and lollipops seemingly attached to the ceiling trusses. However, their integration does not reflect natural placement or texture continuity. They have been digitally imposed onto the scene, standing out due to their overly vibrant colors and lack of blending with the industrial elements, introducing unnatural textures.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the giant sweets produced by the machinery appear proportionate and realistic within the candy factory setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giant sweets placed around the machinery appear disproportionate and do not fit a realistic scale within the context of even a whimsical candy factory. They are excessively large compared to the machinery and space, resulting in a visually jarring effect that does not convincingly represent a setting where such sweets could exist or be produced.",
