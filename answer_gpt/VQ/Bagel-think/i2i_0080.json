      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the dog's fur consistent and natural across both the left side and back views in the combined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the dog's fur is analyzed by observing the details and consistency of shading and fur lines in both the left side and back views. The brown hue of the fur and the way light interacts with it gives a consistent and natural look, similar to how cartoon illustrations depict fur. In comparison with Image A, the fur texture in Image B is consistent across different angles, with shading and highlights applied evenly. The analysis shows that the fur retains a natural cartoon-like texture without apparent disparity between views.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dog maintain appropriate proportions between its front and back views without noticeable distortion or deformation in the combined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportion analysis for Image B involves looking at the dog's size and shape from both angles, particularly observing the body parts like the head, body, and legs for any distortion. In Image B, the proportion between the front view and back view is maintained, with no evident distortion or deformation. The dog's cartoon design matches common animal proportions in stylized illustrations, ensuring consistency from different perspectives. Comparing with Image A, the dimensions and proportions are consistent, no noticeable distortions are observed between views.",

      "question": "Does the dog appear naturally positioned on the bed in both the left side and back views within the combined image, maintaining visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's position on the bed is analyzed by checking the alignment of its body with the bed structure and observing spatial logic. The dog lies naturally on the bed in both the left side and back views, contributing to visual credibility. Its body follows the bed contours, appearing comfortable and properly placed without seeming out of place or awkward. Comparing with Image A, the dog's alignment and position remain visually consistent, maintaining natural positioning on the bed.",

      "question": "Do the dog's ears and tail retain clear details and natural textures without any unnatural artifacts in the combined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is assessed for clarity and detail in the dog's ears and tail by examining the texture, outlines, and shading applied to these features. The cartoon style renders the ears and tail with natural texture, maintaining the characteristic look without anomalies or artifact effects. Comparing with Image A, both ears and tail illustrate consistent cartoon-style detailing, with no unnatural artifacts visible across views.",

      "question": "Do the overall aesthetics of the combined image maintain a natural and authentic appearance without any obvious inconsistencies between the dogâ€™s left side and back views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall aesthetics of Image B are analyzed by evaluating consistency in color, art style, and character dimensions across views. The cartoon presentation maintains a cohesive art style that supports a natural and authentic appearance. The seamless transition between the dog's left side and back views reflects consistent design principles for stylized illustration. When compared with Image A, the combined image upholds visual consistency without obvious discrepancies, presenting a harmonized aesthetic.",
