      "question": "Does the kite maintain its geometric shape without any distortion or damage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite appears as a paper object with folded sections visible, rather than a smooth flying kite. The visual cues show creases and folds typical of paper used in crafts. Based on this analysis, Image B's kite does not maintain a fully intact or typical geometric kite shape.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures on the kite that do not align with the expected paper material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The textures in Image B show clear folding lines and creases which are typical of origami or paper folding. These are expected for a handmade paper structure, indicating an alignment with the paper material appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the yellow color of the kite consistent and natural against the sky backdrop, without any unnatural color variance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the kite against a white background, not a sky. The yellow color appears consistent across the paper surface, but lacks context with a sky backdrop. Thus, there is no unnatural variance within the context shown, but there's no sky backdrop for comparison.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the kite's tail appear structurally coherent and smoothly connected to the kite body, without any visible breaks or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible tail typical of a kite. The composition is primarily focused on folded paper structures. Without a tail present, the coherence or connection cannot be assessed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the kite string depicted naturally, free from any artifacts or unrealistic thickness variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows folded paper without any visible kite string. With no string present in the image, there are no artifacts or thickness variations to evaluate.",
