      "question": "Are the chibi-style 3D models of the sheep and clock free from unnatural textures and maintain their fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the chibi-style 3D models of the sheep and the clock inside the snow globe are depicted with fine details and smooth textures. The sheep exhibits realistic wool-like texture and a cute facial expression typical of chibi designs. The clock has a defined golden color with clear markings. There are no signs of pixelation or loss of detail, suggesting that textures are natural and finely maintained.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep is positioned leaning against the clock inside the snow globe. The positioning appears natural, with the sheep slightly resting its body against the clock. This position gives a sense of comfort and playfulness without any awkward bending or distortions, consistent with chibi design principles which prioritize cuteness and proportionate shapes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows snowflakes inside the snow globe, adding a festive and decorative element to the scene. These snowflakes are distributed evenly and appear to float gently in the air, contributing to the magical effect typical of snow globes. No artifacts such as pixelation or unnatural edges are apparent, maintaining the image's natural and artistic quality.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden tabletop and warm, neutral-toned background in Image B contribute to a visually appealing and cozy atmosphere. The color palette is consistent with earthy tones, enhancing the charm of the snow globe scene. There are no visible inconsistencies, harsh contrasts, or distracting elements in the background that detract from the harmony of the scene.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the snow globe, sheep, clock, and tabletop consistent and logical?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions and physical relationships are well established. The snow globe is appropriately sized on the tabletop, preventing it from appearing oversized or too small. The sheep inside the snow globe, while stylized as chibi, is proportionate to the clock and does not suggest any disproportion between elements. Everything is logically arranged without spatial inconsistencies.",
