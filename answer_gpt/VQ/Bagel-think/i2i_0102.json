      "question": "Does the handwritten word \"Draft\" on the yellow paper appear seamlessly integrated without unnatural textures or color discrepancies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the word \"Draft\" appears handwritten with smooth integration into the yellow paper without noticeable texture or color issues. It resembles real writing in terms of colors and reflects how ink or graphite interacts on paper. Common knowledge about handwriting and graphic design suggests that natural handwriting would integrate, utilizing the surface color without disrupting it visually. Compared to Image A, where the paper is blank, the addition in Image B does not show any signs of mismatched textures or colors, which indicates a seamless integration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the style and material of the handwritten word \"Draft\" visually consistent with the pencil used in the image and typical design sketches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pencil used in the image has a typical design for sketching, implying it would produce graphite marks of a certain width and texture. Image B displays the word \"Draft\" in a medium that appears like ink rather than graphite, which creates inconsistency since the pencil should produce a softer look with potential smudging. Image A shows no writing, but the expected outcome from using a pencil is different from the darker and bolder lines seen in Image B. Based on common usage of pencils for sketches, the style is not typical for pencil markings.",

      "question": "Has the addition of the handwritten word \"Draft\" preserved the structural integrity of the yellow paper, avoiding any distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the yellow paper appears flat and plane without any signs of distortion or misalignment. The word \"Draft\" is placed neatly and does not cause any visible physical changes or warping to the paper. Observing Image B, the positioning of the word is aligned well with the paper's surface, showing that the addition does not affect its structural integrity. Based on knowledge of how writing when carefully done should not physically alter paper structure, it has preserved the structural integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the handwritten word \"Draft\" sharp and clear, without introducing any unnatural blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word \"Draft\" exhibits clear and distinct edges without any blurring or pixelation. The boundary of the letters is sharply outlined, resembling freshly handwritten text. Image A presents the paper without writing, which suggests that any addition should not show low resolution or pixelation. Considering professional graphic design principles, when adding text to an image, maintaining sharpness is essential, and in Image B, it seems to adhere to this principle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the pencil on the yellow paper remain physically logical and visually credible after adding the handwritten word \"Draft\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the pencil positioned naturally above the writing as if actively writing the word \"Draft.\" This positioning is credible, given the angle and orientation of the pencil. In Image A, the pencil rests on blank paper, plausibly positioned for writing. Comparing both images, the logical continuation where the pencil's position indicates a writing process adheres to real-life scenarios, making it visually credible. The angle and proximity of the pencil are consistent with the process of writing on paper.",
