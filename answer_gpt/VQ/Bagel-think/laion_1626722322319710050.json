    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the metallic statue have five fingers on each hand, with natural joint angles and smooth surface transitions, and no visible seams or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue resembles a metallic structure but has been edited with unusual coloration and texture effects, suggesting an unnatural metallic look. However, the fingers are distinct, with a visible hand anatomy indicating five fingers on each hand, natural joint angles, and visible seams or distorted geometry are not evident. The surface transitions appear smooth, coherent with the statue's intended design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leaves of the miniature trees semi-transparent, allowing light to pass through them, and positioned at a distance from the statue that matches their reduced scale without overlapping the figure unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are not miniature; they are normal, large trees that are part of the background. Their leaves do not appear semi-transparent but are a typical green, with sunlight causing some natural transparency effect due to light scattering, not editing. The trees are at an ordinary distance from the statue, and no unnatural overlapping occurs.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the engraved plaques flush with the base surface, with readable text and consistent depth, and do they follow the contour of the pedestal without appearing detached or warped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows darkened plaques with a writing surface that doesn't appear to be fully flush with the base, as the text isn't clearly readable. The engraving has an inconsistency in appearance, likely due to poor editing that makes the text seem warped and not consistent in depth with the pedestal's contour.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the glass dome fully transparent with smooth, continuous curvature, showing accurate reflections of nearby objects and sky, and free from jagged edges or internal distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B there is no visible glass dome present over the statue or pedestal. Hence, there can be no assessment of transparency, reflections, smoothness, or other characteristics; these cues are absent from the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dome stand feature a polished stone surface with subtle texture variation, and are the vine patterns clearly defined, following natural growth patterns without breaking or repeating unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any visible dome stand or noticeable polished stone surface with vine patterns. The entire setup in the image stands without elements that can be described as a dome stand or related textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the glass dome positioned above the statue and base without clipping through any part of the figure or pedestal, and does it rest securely on the dome stand without floating or tilting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no glass dome present above the statue or pedestal, so no evaluation of placement, clipping, or secure resting can be conducted. The image solely showcases a statue on a pedestal devoid of any dome enclosure.",
