    "Question": "Q1: Does the cat maintain natural proportions and anatomical structure without visible stretching, compression, or deformation in the shadow box scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is sitting on a throne, and its proportions appear consistent with what one would expect from a normal-sized domestic cat. The anatomy, including the positioning of the limbs and head, seems accurately represented, with no visible stretching, compression, or distortion evident. The shadow box does not introduce any optical distortions to the cat's appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the velvet curtains appear physically plausible with correct fold patterns, soft shadows, and seamless integration into the background without floating or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the velvet curtains surrounding the throne have realistic fold patterns and exhibit soft shadows consistent with classic interior design. They are seamlessly integrated into the scene, and no edges appear misaligned or give the impression of floating. The lighting on the curtains matches the ambient lighting, enhancing their plausibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the gilded columns properly scaled, positioned with correct perspective, and rendered with reflective metallic surfaces that match the ambient light without artifacts like blurring or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "Image B features gilded columns that are correctly scaled for the throne setting. They have a convincing perspective, contributing to the overall scene depth. The metallic surfaces are well-rendered, reflecting light realistically and without exhibiting blurring or jagged edges, thus fitting well with the rest of the throne elements.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are the hanging mouse portraits clearly visible, correctly sized relative to the scene, and mounted with realistic shadows and string attachments without visual glitches or texture errors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, several mice are depicted, not portraits. The mice are accurately rendered, correctly sized, and proportioned relative to the throne scene. They appear suspended realistically, including string attachments that do not show any texture errors or visual glitches. Their presence adds a playful element without compromising the scene's plausibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"
