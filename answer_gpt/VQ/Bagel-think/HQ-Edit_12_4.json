      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass dome enclosing the pocket watch and fabric exhibit clear, smooth transparency with realistic light refraction and reflection, without visible distortion or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a glass dome enclosing the pocket watch setup like a protective display. It appears to show realistic light behavior, such as reflections and refractions that are typical of high-quality glass. The transparency of the glass allows clear viewing of the objects inside, and there are no visual signs of distortion or irregularities in the glass's shape or surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the miniature leather-bound books and quill placed around the watch at a consistent scale relative to the pocket watch and fabric, and do they rest naturally on the surface without appearing suspended or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the books are proportionally small when compared to the pocket watch, suggesting a miniature setup. They appear intentionally scaled to fit the scene beneath the dome. Additionally, the quill and books rest naturally without appearing suspended or out of place within the context of the display setup.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the leather-bound books display earthy and vibrant colors (such as deep browns, ochres, or burgundies) that harmonize with the original fabric tone, and is the golden embroidery on the fabric continuous, finely detailed, and free of artificial shine or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the books exhibit a range of deep earthy colors that are consistent with classic leather-bound book aesthetics, complementing the warm tones of the maroon fabric with embroidery. However, the fabric and embroidery from Image A is not visible due to the setup, which includes a different fabric base and items under the dome.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pocket watch preserved with intact geometric form, visible engraved patterns, and consistent metallic reflections, showing no deformation or loss of fine detail due to integration into the new scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pocket watch maintains its intricate design and metallic sheen, as seen in Image A. The engraved patterns are still visible, and the geometric form is consistent. The integration into the new setup does not compromise its detailed characteristics or its realistic appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the texture of the maroon fabric with red and gold embroidery consistently sharp and unbroken throughout, including under and around the glass dome, with no blurred areas, repeating patterns, or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature the maroon fabric with embroidery as seen in Image A. Instead, it shows a wooden base and new objects introduced under the dome. Therefore, the question of fabric texture related to Image A does not apply to the edited image.",
