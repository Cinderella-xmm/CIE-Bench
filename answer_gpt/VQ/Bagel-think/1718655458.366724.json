      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all spherical and cubic elements converted into LEGO brick shapes with consistent rectangular prismatic geometry, preserving structural integrity and avoiding warped or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a collection of LEGO bricks stacked together. Each brick retains a consistent, rectangular prismatic geometry, typical of standard LEGO design, with no visible signs of warping or broken edges. Unlike Image A which shows irregular shapes and textures including spheres and cubes with marble textures, Image B has standardized each element into LEGO bricks. This transformation maintains structural integrity and represents a deliberate editing choice to align with the geometry characteristic of LEGO pieces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the transformed LEGO bricks exhibit a uniform matte surface finish without specular highlights or reflections that contradict the intended LEGO material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features LEGO bricks which inherently possess a somewhat matte finish typical of the plastic material used in LEGO pieces. There are no notable specular highlights or reflective surfaces that would mistakenly imply a material other than LEGO plastic. Image A shows marble-textured elements with shiny surfaces implying texture and material inconsistencies for LEGO bricks, whereas Image B achieves uniformity in surface finish without distracting reflections.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible, proportionally accurate interlocking features (e.g., studs or recesses) on the tops and sides of the LEGO bricks that match standard LEGO design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tops of the LEGO bricks are equipped with standard studs which are a fundamental feature for interlocking LEGO bricks. This is indicative of typical LEGO design, allowing for bricks to be connected securely. The studs and recesses ensure compatibility with the LEGO system, both in appearance and function. These features are absent in Image A, which depicts natural marble shapes with no interlocking design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all LEGO bricks arranged in a stable, grounded formation on a wooden shelf surface, with no floating or suspended pieces that defy gravity or spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows LEGO bricks resting on a wooden shelf, maintaining a grounded formation. All bricks are coherently stacked and placed, conforming to physical logic associated with stability on a shelf. None of the pieces appear to be floating or suspended, which contrasts with Image A, where objects are scattered with some elements appearing to be airborne, defying typical spatial arrangement.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly simplified into a clean, neutral tone without any residual textures, shadows, or depth cues that conflict with the minimalist intent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is simplified, showing a wooden shelf with no conflicting textures or shadows. This contrasts with Image A's complex background featuring depth and texture indicative of different lighting and surface effects. Image B thus reflects a minimalist intent by removing unnecessary details for an unembellished presentation.",
