    "Question": "Q1: Does the sandpiper's body maintain correct proportions and natural posture, with wings aligned to the torso and legs positioned symmetrically beneath the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sandpiper illustration's body maintains correct proportions and natural posture: the wings are aligned with the torso, and the legs are symmetrically positioned beneath the body. This matches a typical depiction of a shorebird, where the anatomy is supposed to look balanced and natural. The bird seems accurately stylized for packaging, but retains a realistic pose.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the textures on the packaging surface uniform in pattern and color, with no repeating tiles, sharp edges, or unnatural transitions between areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging surface has a textured appearance with consistent patterns and colors. The transition between different background elements, such as the waves and sand, seem smooth without abrupt edges or mismatched repeats. The design appears cohesive and aesthetically integrated.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the text 'Shoreline Explorer Set' fully visible, correctly aligned, and rendered with smooth edges without jagged lines or transparency artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text on the packaging appears to be replaced by 'SIRFTIANERY' and other unidentified words, possibly due to being digitally altered or obscured. The text lacks clarity and alignment expected from professional packaging, indicating issues with rendering or aliasing.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the wave patterns on the flat bottom of the packaging form continuous, flowing curves without gaps, overlaps, or angular distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wave patterns on the packaging's bottom seem to form flowing curves without visible gaps or angular distortions. The artistic rendering of the waves accompanies the shorebird theme and maintains a fluid design without abrupt transitions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Is the binocular-shaped cut-out window properly shaped with smooth contours, and does it show a clear, non-distorted view of internal kit components without floating or misplaced objects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the binocular-shaped cut-out window appears well-shaped, with smooth contours, and it doesn't show any floating or misplaced objects. However, the internal view does not reveal specific kit components, possibly due to the use of a flat design for promotional purposes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a smooth, continuous transition between the sandpiper illustration and the surrounding packaging elements, with no visible outlines, shadows, or color discontinuities?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sandpiper illustration blends smoothly with packaging elements, showing no visible outlines, shadows, or color discontinuities. The bird is integrated well within the graphical environment, lending a unified appearance, typical of commercial packaging design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
