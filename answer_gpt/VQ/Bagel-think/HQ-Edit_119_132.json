      "question": "Are the paws of the husky significantly larger than natural proportions but still maintaining smooth, rounded shapes without distorted edges or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paws of the husky appear larger than natural proportions. This can be inferred from world knowledge regarding stuffed animals where features such as paws are oversized for aesthetic purposes. The paws maintain smooth, rounded shapes as is typical for plush toys, without distorted edges or broken geometry. This indicates a design choice common in plush toys to enhance cuteness and comfort, distinct from the realistic anatomy seen in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the entire body covered in a seamless, velvety fabric texture that uniformly replaces the original fur without visible seams, texture inconsistencies, or areas where fur remains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the husky with a seamless, velvety fabric texture across its entire body. This is typical for plush toys, where fur is replaced with fabric to create a tactile, cozy experience, different from the realistic fur texture in Image A. There are no visible seams, texture inconsistencies, or areas with the original fur remaining, indicating a complete transformation into a plush form using soft fabric.",

      "question": "Are the eyes replaced with clearly defined, symmetrical embroidered patterns that maintain proper positioning and spacing relative to the nose and ears, without jagged lines or misplaced stitches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are replaced with embroidered patterns typical for a plush toy, indicating a transformation from realistic blue eyes in Image A. The embroidered eyes are clearly defined and symmetrical, maintaining proper positioning and spacing relative to the nose and ears. There are no jagged lines or misplaced stitches observed, designed to aesthetically fit the plush toy's face with accuracy.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tail appear significantly fuller and fluffier than in the original image but remain attached to the body with a continuous, cohesive shape and no floating or detached segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail in Image B appears fuller and fluffier, fitting the plush toy aesthetic, whereas in Image A, the husky's tail has a realistic proportion. In Image B, this increased fullness is typical for stuffed toys to enhance cuteness. Despite being fuller, the tail remains attached to the husky body with a continuous, cohesive shape, without floating or detached segments. This representation shows the intended design for stability and unity characteristic of plush toys.",

      "question": "Has the original snowy landscape and surrounding trees been fully replaced by a clean wooden shelf and minimalist backdrop, with no traces of snow, trees, or sky remaining in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B entirely replaces the original snowy landscape and trees found in Image A with a clean wooden shelf and a minimalist backdrop. There are no traces of snow, trees, or sky present in Image B, representing a stark transformation from a natural outdoor scene to an indoor setting typical for displaying a plush toy. This reflects a deliberate alteration for thematic consistency with the stuffed husky.",
