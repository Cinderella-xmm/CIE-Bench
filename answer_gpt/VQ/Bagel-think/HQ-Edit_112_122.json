      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the dress clearly defined, proportionally consistent with the garment’s scale, and free from jagged edges or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the dress is smooth and its colors are well-blended. The floral details on the dress appear consistent with the scale of the garment, free from jagged edges or pixelated artifacts, as the patterns are seamlessly integrated into the overall design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lighting from the top right cast soft gradients on the woman’s face, dress, and nearby flowers without causing unnatural overexposure or disconnected highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting emanating from the top right creates soft gradients across the scene. The woman's dress and the nearby flowers have highlights that are smoothly integrated into their respective forms without unnatural overexposure or disconnected highlights.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the floating petals distributed evenly in mid-air, showing natural dispersion and depth, with no clustered or floating-in-place anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The petals in Image B appear to be distributed in a natural and dynamic way, exhibiting a sense of movement and depth in the scene. There are no anomalies such as clustering or static floating, suggesting a well-rendered dispersion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the floral vines forming the writing area extend naturally from surrounding plants, maintaining consistent thickness, color, and growth direction without abrupt starts or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral vines around the writing area transition smoothly from the surrounding plants. They maintain consistent thickness, color, and growth direction, creating a cohesive and natural extension without any abrupt starts or breaks.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman's hand in Image B shows five distinct fingers, each with natural curvature and spacing. The attachment of the hand to the arm appears anatomically correct without any distortion or unnatural appearances.",
