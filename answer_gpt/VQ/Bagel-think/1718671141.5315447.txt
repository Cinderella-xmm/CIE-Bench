    "Question": "Q1: Are the brass gears and copper funnels added to the building's exterior consistent in material appearance, showing realistic metallic reflections and surface details without artificial or pixelated textures?",
    "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the exterior features a variety of steampunk elements such as gears and funnels, mostly in brass and copper colors. These components appear consistent in their metallic appearance, displaying realistic reflections and surface details typical of high-quality metal finishes. They do not have pixelated or artificial textures, which indicates a well-rendered image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the clock faces on the observatory dome maintain correct proportions and alignment with the spherical shape, with no visible warping or bending of clock numerals or hands?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clock faces are centrally and symmetrically placed on the dome-shaped structure, maintaining the correct spherical alignment. The numerals and hands are clearly visible and do not show signs of warping or bending, which suggests careful attention to maintaining proportions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the steam emanating from the structure appear volumetric and translucent, rising naturally from vents without abrupt edges or unnatural clustering?",
    "explanation": "The steam in Image B seems volumetric and translucent, which appears to rise naturally and smoothly from the steam vents without abrupt edges or clustering. This suggests a realistic depiction of steam emanation, fitting well with the overall design and enhancing the steampunk atmosphere.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ornamental metal details on the observatory dome continuous and properly scaled, with no gaps, overlapping errors, or jagged edges suggesting incomplete rendering?",
    "explanation": "The ornamental metal details on the dome in Image B appear continuous and properly scaled, exhibiting smooth curves and connections without gaps or overlapping errors. There are no jagged edges visible, which suggests that rendering these details was complete and coherent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the reflection of the building in the water a symmetrical and undistorted mirror image of the edited structure, including all added steampunk elements such as gears, clock faces, and steam vents?",
    "explanation": "The reflection in the water in Image B shows a symmetrical and undistorted mirror image of the entire structure, capturing the steampunk elements like gears, clock faces, and steam vents. The reflection accurately mimics the shape and details of the edited building, proving effective rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
