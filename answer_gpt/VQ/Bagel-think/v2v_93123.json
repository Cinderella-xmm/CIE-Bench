      "question": "Does the lighting on the man and the pineapple appear consistent with the new aged blackboard background, without introducing unnatural shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the new aged blackboard background with chalk-written equations and drawings has a more luminous appearance compared to Image Aâ€™s softer background. The lighting on the man and pineapple is darker and warmer. This distinction creates an inconsistency because bright backgrounds typically affect the foreground lighting, yet the lighting on the man and the pineapple does not correspond with this bright chalkboard background. Therefore, the integration results in unnatural lighting variations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts or unnatural edges where the man and the pineapple meet the new aged blackboard background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interface between the man, pineapple, and the chalkboard background seems seamless and lacks visible artifacts or unnatural edges. The integration looks smooth at the meeting points, preserving regular contour lines and eliminating noticeable disturbances in the transition zones.",

      "question": "Do the chalk-written equations and galactic sketches on the new blackboard background integrate naturally with the man and the pineapple, maintaining structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The new chalkboard background with equations and galactic sketches in Image B adds a thematic depth but might not directly align with the visual style and structure of the man and pineapple. While structurally coherent themes are ensured through consistent narrative elements, the differences in the artistic execution and visual textures between the foreground objects and background depiction result in less natural integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the proportions and details of the man and the pineapple been preserved, avoiding any distortion or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man and pineapple retain their original proportions and display fine details from Image A, such as the texture on the pineapple and the fabric of the man's coat. There is no evidence of distortion or degradation of detail in the objects after the background change, ensuring fidelity to their original appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the texture of the new aged blackboard background complement the man and the pineapple, without introducing any unnatural or conflicting textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The new aged blackboard background in Image B is a stark contrast against the softer, muted tones of the man and pineapple. The chalk illustrations and galactic designs create an artistic impression but don't harmonize fully with the textured realism of the foreground objects, revealing a difference in style that can appear conflicting.",
