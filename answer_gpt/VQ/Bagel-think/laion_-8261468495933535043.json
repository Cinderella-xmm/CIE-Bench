      "question": "Do the tessellated tiles forming the sausages maintain the original elongated, curved shape without geometric distortion or unnatural straightening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tessellated tiles are arranged to form shapes resembling sausages, and their alignment reflects the elongated, curved form depicted in Image A. By analyzing Image B, we observe that the lines and orientation of the tiles are carefully placed to mimic the natural curvature and smooth surface of the sausages without introducing geometric distortion or straightened lines.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the green-tiled areas shaped to mimic the natural ruffled edges and layered structure of lettuce leaves, with no uniform or blocky alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the green-tiled areas, representative of lettuce leaves, with varied and irregular placement and tile shapes to suggest the ruffled edges and layered appearance typical of real lettuce. The tiles are not placed in a uniform or blocky fashion, capturing the organic textures and naturalistic forms of leaves as displayed in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the egg-shaped tile formation perfectly circular with a centrally placed orange-yellow yolk section, matching the original egg’s proportions and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The egg in Image B is composed of tiles that form a circular arrangement, and the yolk is centrally placed within this formation. However, upon careful inspection, the edges and tiling suggest a slightly distorted circular shape compared to the perfectly circular appearance in Image A. The tile arrangement introduces small variations in proportions and orientation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mosaic elements positioned symmetrically around the plate’s center, with equal spacing and proportional sizing between the sausage, salad, and egg sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic arrangement of elements around the plate does not exhibit perfect symmetry or uniform spacing. The sausages, salad, and egg sections do not have equal proportions relative to the plate's center, as the tiles introduce variances in sizing and spacing compared to the more naturally laid out composition in Image A.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all glass tiles exhibit uniform edge definition, subtle reflection effects, and consistent color shading without visible artifacts like blurring or jagged lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tessellated tiles in Image B display consistent color shading and often subtle reflections, but upon close inspection, edge definition varies between tiles. Some edges appear sharper, while others show jaggedness or slight blurring, deviating from uniformity and consistency expected in perfect mosaic art.",
