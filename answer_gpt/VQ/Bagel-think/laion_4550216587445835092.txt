    "Question": "Q3: Do the motion lines and energy beams from the spirit and Naruto’s attack converge smoothly at the fusion point, showing continuous flow without abrupt breaks or misalignment?",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the debris and elemental fragments in the background rendered with consistent lighting and shadow, appearing to float in a shared 3D space rather than being pasted flatly?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of debris and elemental fragments appears three-dimensional, as they feature shading and highlights consistent with the lighting direction suggested by the energy blast. This suggests a sense of depth and floating motion, enhancing the immersive quality.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does Naruto’s face retain the original number of whisker marks, eye shape, and headband position, with no distorted lines or missing features?",

Therefore, no obvious disproportion or missing features are present outside the obscured feature.",

They are positioned to avoid obstruction of crucial visual elements such as Naruto’s hand or the energy fusion point, ensuring they remain readable and non-intrusive.",
