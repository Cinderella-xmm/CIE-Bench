      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cutout windows on each tier aligned with the chocolate drops and have smooth, uninterrupted edges without jagged or fragmented borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the package design shows a pyramid with cutouts displaying drops containing nuts. The edges of these windows appear smooth and uninterrupted, following a uniform pattern that aligns with the chocolate drops visible behind the openings. In Image A, a tiered chocolate tower also shows alignment of the windows with the chocolate design elements, featuring smooth windows without jagged lines. Comparing these, both images maintain smooth edges for cutout windows, indicating consistent design quality.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gold foiling applied across the surface show uniform reflectivity and smooth transitions without visible seams, pixelation, or overly bright spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pyramid packaging presents gold foiling as accents around the chocolate drops visible in the cutouts. The foiling appears smooth and evenly reflective, without noticeable seams or pixelation. Reflectivity is consistent, without overly bright spots disrupting the surface. In Image A, gold foiling is visibly uniform across the chocolate elements in the tower, maintaining a smooth reflective quality. Comparing these, both images suggest careful application of gold foil without disruptions in uniformity and smoothness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the nut embellishments attached to the chocolate surface with natural positioning, showing correct shadows and depth, and no floating or misplaced instances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features chocolate-shaped drops visible through cutout windows, populated with nuts. Observing the positioning and shadows implies a natural integration with the chocolate drops, displaying depth and correct placement without signs of floating or misalignment. Image A’s chocolate tower also demonstrates nuts accurately placed within chocolate drops, presenting natural shadows and depth. In comparison, both images reflect a cohesive design of nut embellishments with accurate shadowing and placement.",

      "question": "Are the sparkle effects evenly distributed and faint enough to resemble light reflections on chocolate, without forming clusters or sharp, unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the chocolate details inside the pyramid packaging, there are faint sparkle effects suggesting light reflections, evenly dispersed without clustering or forming sharp highlights. This enhances the realistic appearance of shiny surface textures. Image A’s chocolate tower also shows subtle sparkle effects implying soft light reflections, evenly distributed. Comparing both images, sparkle effects are managed to maintain a natural look without disruptive highlights.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the new text “ChocoConifer Delights” clearly readable, properly spaced, and integrated into the base without overlapping or distorting the surrounding chocolate ring or motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'ChocoConifer Delights' appears prominently on the pyramid packaging. It's notable for clarity, correct spacing, and integration into the design without encroaching upon chocolate design or nearby motifs. In Image A, text similarly presents clear readability without distortion. Comparing both images, integration of text maintains proper format, readability, and does not interfere with adjacent design elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the tiers of the tower evenly spaced and aligned vertically, preserving the original conical shape without bulging, shrinking, or skewed angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging pyramid suggests a conical structure preserving smooth lines and symmetry, although only one tier is depicted. Image A illustrates a tiered chocolate tower, with visible tier alignment suggesting uniform spacing and correct vertical alignment without distortion, preserving the conical shape. While Image B shows less direct tier presence for comparison, both maintain an accurate representation of their given structure without flaws in shape alignment.",
