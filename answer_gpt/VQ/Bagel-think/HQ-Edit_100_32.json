      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera is being held securely by both hands with a natural grip angle. The metallic accents on the camera show consistent highlights and reflections, indicating proper lighting and editing. Comparing this with Image A, the camera appears proportional and correctly integrated with the hands in both images.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a gradient background that appears to blend seamlessly with the subject's edges, with no visible haloing, sharp cutoffs, or color bleeding. The transition in colors and the smoothness of the gradient suggest careful editing. Comparing with Image A, the integration appears consistent.",
