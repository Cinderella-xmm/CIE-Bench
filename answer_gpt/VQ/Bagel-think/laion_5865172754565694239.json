    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features on the frame near the handlebars seamlessly integrated with the red surface, showing no visible seams, texture mismatch, or color artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon character is superimposed onto the bike, and the character's face is partially located near the handlebars. The visual cues show a smoothly integrated appearance with no visible seams or color discrepancies, suggesting that the cartoon face is merged effectively with the red frame. This seamless integration maintains the illusion of the cartoon face being naturally part of the bike's structure, with no apparent artifacts or mismatches.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cartoon limbs extend from the hub centers without distorting the wheel rims, spokes, or hub components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon character is placed as if riding the bike, with its limbs extending outward. Upon examination, these limbs appear to originate from positions near the hub centers of the wheels, but they do not interfere with or alter the structure of the wheels' rims, spokes, or hubs. This careful placement ensures that while the character is added to the image, it does not result in any distortion or disruption of the bike's wheel integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the motion lines positioned along the sides of the bike and angled forward, without crossing over the chain, derailleur, or “DUCATI” logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes motion lines that are characteristic of cartoon depictions of speed. These lines are traditionally placed to suggest movement and are usually positioned along the sides of the object in motion. In this image, the motion lines are indeed placed along the sides of the bike, moving forward, and do not intersect with functional elements like the chain, derailleur, or the branding text 'DUCATI'. This precise placement of motion lines ensures clarity and retains the bike's brand information.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the frame retain its original tubular structure and dimensional consistency despite the added hero suit design, with no bulges, collapses, or incorrect curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B features a cartoon character overlay that implies a superhero theme, the underlying bicycle frame maintains its original tubular and dimensional integrity. The structure shows no signs of distortion, such as bulges or incorrect bending, which indicates that the character design was superimposed in a manner that preserves the bike's physical shape and consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sound effect texts positioned outside the main structural components of the bike and oriented in a way that suggests movement, without obscuring the “DUCATI” branding or control levers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, sound effect text like 'ELIP!' is included to enhance the dynamic feel. This text is positioned outside the main sections of the bike, specifically placed near the rear wheel and away from crucial branding, such as 'DUCATI', and functional parts like control levers. This intelligent placement ensures the text contributes to the sense of motion while preserving the visibility of the bike's key components and branding.",
