      "question": "Does the 3D chibi rendition of the dancer maintain natural proportions without introducing any unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi dancer is designed with stylized proportions typical of chibi art, such as a larger head and smaller body. While not reflective of natural human proportions, these proportions are consistent with the artistic style of chibi, and there are no unnatural distortions beyond this intentional design choice. Therefore, within the context of chibi art, the proportions are natural.",

      "question": "Is the glowing elliptical portal visually credible, with no obvious artifacts where it meets the realistic dance studio environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing elliptical portal is presented with smooth, consistent lighting and a well-integrated design that seamlessly meets the dance studio environment. The portal's light gracefully transitions to the surrounding area, and there are no visible seams or artifacts that would disrupt its credibility. This attention to detail creates a visually believable scene.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dancer's hand extending towards the viewer retain natural textures and details, with no more than five fingers visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the dancer's hand is designed with simple, smooth surfaces typical of chibi or cartoon characters, which often lack detailed textures. The hand in Image B appears with a simple structure, and all five fingers are visible, which aligns with human anatomy. Despite the lack of detailed textures, this does not detract from its natural appearance within the stylized context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the spotlight effects in the grayscale 3D chibi world consistent with the dancer's pose, contributing to a natural and visually plausible scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image is actually colorful, not grayscale, and there are no explicit spotlight effects present. The lighting in Image B is even and bright, suitable for the context of a dance studio, and supports the dancer's pose to enhance the visual experience and plausibility without specific spotlight effects.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition adhere to the 2:3 aspect ratio, with the dancer and portal positioned in a balanced manner that enhances visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition appears square rather than in a 2:3 aspect ratio, with the dancer and portal centrally positioned to create a balanced scene. The balance enhances visual appeal and credibility but does not adhere to the 2:3 aspect ratio.",
