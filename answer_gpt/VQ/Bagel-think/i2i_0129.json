      "question": "Does the giant manta ray seamlessly replace the surfboard, maintaining the surferâ€™s pose without unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it is evident that the surfboard is replaced by the manta ray, as the man is positioned atop a creature that unmistakably resembles a manta ray. The surfer maintains his balance in a way that appears natural, with both feet firmly atop the ray, similar to standing on a surfboard. The surfer's pose does not show any noticeable distortion, indicating a smooth transition from surfboard to manta ray.",

      "question": "Have the dreamy atmosphere effects been integrated smoothly, enhancing the image without creating unnatural artifacts or losing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the overall atmosphere appears consistent and natural, as the scene retains its clarity and detail without any obvious dreamy filters or altered lighting. The sky and ocean look realistic, maintaining the original image's appearance without introducing any artifacts or loss of detail.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the interaction between the manta ray and the waves visually credible, avoiding any apparent breaks in texture or geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The manta ray's integration into the wave is quite seamless. The ray appears to be naturally riding on top of the wave, and there are no visible discontinuities or unnatural breaks where the ray meets the water. The geometry and textures flow smoothly, contributing to a credible scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the size and shape of the manta ray align naturally with the scale of the surfboard and surfer, avoiding disproportionate or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, the manta ray matches the scale one would expect from a typical surfboard. Its size appears appropriate in relation to the surfer, avoiding any impression of exaggeration or disproportion that would suggest unrealistic scaling.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures and edges of the manta ray free of visible artifacts, maintaining smooth transitions and natural details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A close look at Image B reveals that the textures on the manta ray are consistent and well-defined, without the presence of digital artifacts. The edges of the ray are smooth and integrate naturally with the surroundings, preserving a cohesive and detailed look.",
