    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the tentacle-like extensions smoothly integrated into the original curves of the facade without sudden angular breaks or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tentacle-like extensions appear to be a direct continuation of the building's curvilinear design. They flow seamlessly along the contours of the facade without any noticeable angular breaks or abrupt terminations that might suggest a lack of integration. The smooth flow indicates that they are integrated into the original curves effectively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the fibrous textures follow the curvature of the facade and appear continuous without repeating patterns or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the fibrous textures are arranged in a way that they mimic the flowing lines of the building's facade. These textures do not show signs of repetition or jagged edges, maintaining a continuous pattern that aligns with the architectural curves. This suggests that attention has been given to ensure that the textures follow the building's lines smoothly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the window areas replaced with translucent membranes that maintain soft light transmission and lack sharp borders or visible seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The window areas in Image B still appear to have the original glass with the interior lighting enhancing a soft appearance, perhaps giving the illusion of a membrane. There are no sharp borders or visible seams which can be perceived in this context, suggesting that, if they were altered, it was done in a way to preserve the original characteristics.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the iridescent scale patterns align with the surface curvature and display smooth color transitions without flat or distorted regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The iridescent scale patterns in Image B follow the building's architecture faithfully, aligning with its curves. The colors transition smoothly along these scales, without any visible flat or distorted areas. This implies the patterns are well-integrated and follow the surface curvature accurately, providing a sense of depth and dimension.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bio-luminescent lines emit a soft, uneven glow that fades naturally at the edges and interacts with nearby surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bio-luminescent lines show a soft, uneven glow. The light emitted appears to fade naturally at the edges, casting a gentle hue that interacts with the surrounding surfaces, enhancing their dimensionality. This suggests a realistic representation of bio-luminescence in interaction with the architectural elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all modified elements—tentacles, membranes, textures, and glow lines—properly anchored to the building structure without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, all modified elements, including the tentacles, membranes, textures, and glow lines, appear to be well-integrated and anchored to the building's structure. There are no indications of elements floating or overlapping incorrectly, indicating precise alignment with the architectural features.",

      "question": "Are balcony railings, interior furniture, and planters still visible and undistorted beneath the added textures and lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the added textures and lighting effects in Image B, the balcony railings, interior furniture, and planters remain visible and retain their original form. They are not distorted by the edits, suggesting careful attention has been paid to preserve these everyday functional elements while enhancing the building's exterior.",
