    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the seat cushion's surfaces composed of clearly defined, uniformly sized LEGO brick layers with smooth gradients between them, maintaining a consistent black color without texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seat cushion appears smooth with a consistent black color and maintains a plain surface without the distinct structure or appearance of LEGO bricks. The surface does not show any LEGO-style designs such as the studs or grooves typical to LEGO pieces. Therefore, the seat cushion is not composed of LEGO brick layers.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the backrest consist of evenly spaced, horizontally aligned LEGO brick layers that follow the original contour without gaps, misalignments, or irregular spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backrest presents a consistent, smooth design, maintaining its original curvature and texture, without the distinct horizontal layers and structure typical of LEGO brick layers. The backrest maintains its alignment and spacing, but does not consist of LEGO brick layers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the armrests rendered as simple hinged LEGO pieces with clean edges and uniform silver finish, preserving their original curvature and connection points without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armrests are composed of clear plastic or similar appearance and maintain smooth curvature with clean edges. However, they appear as simplistic structures without any features or design elements that resemble LEGO, such as hinges or studs. They do not have a uniform silver finish and instead retain a translucent quality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all five wheels made of translucent gray material with visible internal structure resembling LEGO wheel design, and do they maintain consistent size and placement under the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheels in Image B are not depicted as translucent or containing any visible internal structure. They appear as solid black without the specific characteristics of a LEGO wheel design, which usually includes visible components or grooves. The consistency of their size and placement is not in question, but they do not match the described LEGO-like appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the chair positioned on a flat, uninterrupted white tabletop surface that contrasts with the original floor, with no visible shadows or depth inconsistencies suggesting misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair is placed on a white, flat surface which appears to be a tabletop. There are no visible shadows that suggest depth inconsistencies or misalignment with the surface. The white surface contrasts with the more textured appearance of the original image's floor, indicating a consistent tabletop environment.",
