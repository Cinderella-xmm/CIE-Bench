      "question": "Do the stripes on the character's costume maintain their clarity and definition without unnatural blurring or distortion in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes on the character's costume appear bold and well-defined, consistent with the patterns typically seen in striped clothing. The claymation style often involves a certain level of texture manipulation, but the stripes here remain clear and distinct, avoiding any blurring or distortion that would obscure their pattern. Therefore, based on the visual cues and my knowledge about typical claymation representations, the clarity and definition are maintained.",

      "question": "Does the beret retain its original shape and placement on the character's head without appearing unnaturally warped or misplaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beret looks natural in shape and is appropriately placed on the character's head. The claymation style may introduce a slightly smoother texture or slightly exaggerated features for stylistic purposes, but the beret does not show any signs of warping or misplacement that would make it appear unnatural. It's consistent with the typical look of a beret atop a character's head within such themed visual representation.",

      "question": "Are the fingers on the character's hand holding the phone naturally shaped and textured, without any unnatural distortions or missing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the fingers gripping the phone show slight simplification expected in claymation, where details are often reduced for stylistic effect. However, they retain a natural shape and proportion relative to the hand and the phone, following human anatomical standards. There is no apparent distortion or missing detail that stands out as unnatural in this stylized context.",

      "question": "Do the European rooftops and buildings in the background retain their structural integrity and visual plausibility without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the background rooftops and buildings with a stylized, slightly cartoonish texture typical of claymation, yet they maintain their basic structural integrity and visual coherence. The architectural forms are recognizable and align with the expected features of European rooftops, showing no significant warping or unnatural elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character's pose, including the way they hold the phone, appear natural and consistent with human ergonomics in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's pose, hand positioning on the phone, and overall stance are consistent with what one would expect from a natural human posture. The claymation style may introduce a cartoon-like smoothness, but the ergonomic positioning of limbs and how objects such as a phone are held reflects a commonly accepted depiction of such actions. There doesn't appear to be any impractical or ergonomically incorrect positioning.",
