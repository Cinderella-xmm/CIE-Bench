      "question": "Do the chibi-style characters maintain natural proportions and avoid unnatural distortion in their body shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi-style characters are characterized by their playful proportions, typically with oversized heads and petite bodies, creating a cute and stylized appearance. In Image B, the characters conform to this chibi aesthetic with their characteristically large heads and proportionally smaller bodies. This stylization is deliberate and a defining trait of chibi art, and resultant proportions are considered natural within this style. Thus, they do not display any unnatural distortion beyond what is expected for chibi characters.",

      "question": "Are the traditional Chinese wedding outfits (changpao, magua, xiuhe gown) depicted with vivid details and natural textures, fitting well with the chibi characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outfits in Image B include intricate patterns and designs typical of traditional Chinese wedding attire. The use of bright red and gold colors mimics genuine wedding gowns and contributes to the festive and traditional theme, fitting well with the appearance of the chibi figures. The detailing on the clothing, such as the embroidery, is stylized to match chibi aesthetics but retains enough detail to recognize the traditional elements.",

      "question": "Does the ruby-red backdrop with the \"囍\" paper-cut design blend naturally with the rest of the image, enhancing the festive atmosphere without causing visual disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Chinese culture, red is a traditional color for celebrations, especially weddings, where the '囍' symbol represents double happiness. In Image B, the red backdrop complements the wedding theme and the chibi characters in their red outfits. The paper-cut design is a traditional decorative element and is visually coherent with the overall theme, enhancing the image's festivity without causing visual discord.",

      "question": "Are the golden dragon and phoenix designs on the chibi characters' outfits detailed and coherent, without any loss of fine details or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters' attire showcases common elements like the dragon and phoenix, symbols of good fortune and harmony in marriage. These designs are presented in a simplified form that aligns with the chibi style, harmonizing with the overall aesthetic of the outfits. The designs are sufficiently detailed to be recognizable, maintaining coherence without sacrificing detail or introducing textures that seem out of place.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition of the image, including the chibi characters, horse-drawn carriage, and festive backdrop, remain structurally consistent and visually credible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of Image B effectively integrates the chibi characters, the carriage, and the backdrop into a unified scene. While chibi style inherently involves exaggerated features, the proportions within this context are consistent and intentional, supporting the narrative of a festive occasion. The scene feels structured and visually harmonious, with each element contributing to the overall credibility and cohesion of the image.",
