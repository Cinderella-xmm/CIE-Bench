      "question": "Does the book animation on the clock face align perfectly with the curved top and vertical frame of the clock, maintaining consistent proportions and smooth transitions between materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face has been replaced with a book animation. The alignment of this animation involves checking if its dimensions correspond to the curved top and vertical elements of the clock, ensuring that it fits naturally without appearing out of place. Upon observing Image B, it is evident that the book does not maintain consistent proportions with the clock's structure, and the transition from the book to the wooden frame appears abrupt and unnatural, indicating that the alignment is not perfect.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the text snippets embedded in the wallpaper clearly legible, evenly spaced, and seamlessly blended into the background pattern without creating unnatural shadows or color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the text snippets are embedded within the wallpaper. For the embedding to be seamless, the text must be clear, without disrupting the wallpaper’s original design. However, in Image B, the snippets are not uniformly spaced, appear to float above the wallpaper creating unnatural shadows, and disrupt the overall continuity of the wallpaper pattern by introducing noticeable discrepancies.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the image of the ancient sundial inside the framed artwork properly scaled, centered, and rendered with consistent lighting and depth relative to the original frame and surrounding wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a substitution of framed artwork with an image of an ancient sundial. For proper scaling and centering, the sundial should fit well within the bounds of the frame, without appearing disproportionately large or small, and lighting should match the wall context. However, the sundial image in Image B seems improperly scaled, possibly not centered, and the rendering lacks consistency in lighting and depth, making it incongruous with its surroundings.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the pen-shaped clock hands appear structurally sound, properly aligned with the book’s cover, and free from distortion such as bent metal parts or mismatched shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible pen-shaped clock hands aligned with any book cover on the clock, as the visible elements on the clock are replaced by a plain surface with text and a triangular object. Hence, the question of their structural soundness, alignment, and absence of distortion does not apply.",

      "question": "Are the captions placed in the room clearly readable, stylistically consistent with art-nouveau design, and physically integrated into their respective surfaces without overlapping or distorting underlying materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, captions are visible as part of the embedded images and texts on surfaces like the wall and the rug. These captions should be clear, consistent with the overall art-nouveau style of the room, and blend seamlessly without overlapping existing materials. However, upon examination, the captions do not appear to be well-integrated or conforming to the room's style, and they disrupt the original design by overlapping and causing distortions.",
