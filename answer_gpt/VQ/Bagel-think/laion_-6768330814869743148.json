      "question": "Do the pastries in the edited image maintain their original shapes without distorted or stretched forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries are transformed into abstract shapes using bold colors and geometric forms. The original form of the pastries, as seen in Image A, is not preserved. Pastries typically have distinct dimensions and curves. These features are not evident in the edited version, which instead uses simplified and stylized forms that don't reflect the pastries' realistic outlines. The reasoning process here involves recognizing the stylization and abstraction applied in Image B, which inherently alters the original shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bread slices' internal textures clearly visible and consistent with real bread, or do they appear overly stylized with uniform patterns that lack natural variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bread slices are depicted as flat shapes with solid colors, lacking any visible texture or natural variation characteristic of real bread. Bread typically has a crumb structure that would show varying textures. These are absent in the edited image, indicating a move towards abstraction and simplification. The analysis involves recognizing that the stylized approach replaces complex textures with simple colors and forms.",

      "question": "Do the muffin liners show clear geometric patterns that still align with the shape of the muffins and do not float or detach from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the muffins are illustrated with geometric, circular forms, and black liners that are visible but lack realistic alignment with the muffin shape seen in Image A. Muffin liners generally hug the muffins, with folds conforming to the muffins' shape, which is absent in the edited image. This points to a stylized representation where the liner does not follow the natural contour of a muffin. The reasoning involves comparing the spatial alignment and the degree of abstraction used.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the checkerboard pattern applied uniformly across the tray surfaces without breaking the perceived depth or causing unnatural flatness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not utilize a checkerboard pattern directly but rather displays bright and abstract colors that replace the realistic texture of trays seen in Image A. The stylization in Image B results in a loss of depth perception and introduces flatness due to solid colors overriding the original texture and dimensions seen in Image A. The comparison establishes that there is an intentional alteration of depth in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the abstract shapes in the background positioned in a way that matches the depth and alignment of the original cup stack, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is composed of abstract elements using vivid colors that replace the detailed cup setup seen in Image A. The altered background does not preserve the original alignment or depth cues inherent to stacked objects; instead, it leans towards a planar aesthetic where alignment and depth perception are compromised. The analysis is based on recognizing changes in spatial dimensions and alignment.",
