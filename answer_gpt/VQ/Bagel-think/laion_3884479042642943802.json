      "question": "Does the character's crouched pose maintain natural limb proportions and joint alignment without exaggerated or distorted angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's pose seems dynamic and realistic for a crouched position. The arms and legs appear to be in proportion, with the joints notably in natural alignment, which is crucial for this kind of pose where action and readiness are implied. This was determined by observing the angles at knees and elbows, which do not appear exaggerated or unnatural.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the rooftop ledge positioned directly under the character’s feet with consistent shadow direction and material texture that matches the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooftop ledge is correctly placed under the character's feet. The shadows cast by the character are consistent with the likely light source coming from behind, suggested by the spotlight in the background. The texture of the rooftop ledge supports the setting, maintaining a congruous appearance with what would be expected on a city rooftop scene at night.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the distant skyscrapers and spotlights in the background properly scaled and positioned to match the character’s viewpoint and lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skyscrapers and spotlights in Image B are depicted in a way that retains proper perspective and depth relative to the character. The cityscape's scaling maintains a believable proportion compared to the character's size, indicating an accurate positioning of distant structures and accounting for the viewpoint from the rooftop. The light direction aligns with the positioning of the spotlights.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the claws exhibit a metallic glint that follows the direction of the spotlight illumination without excessive or misplaced reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the claws exhibit a subtle metallic sheen that corresponds with the direction of illumination provided by the spotlights from the background. The reflections appear limited and correctly oriented to the surrounding light sources, avoiding excessive or misplaced shine that would be inconsistent with the given lighting conditions.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the speech text clearly visible, properly aligned, and placed in a position that does not interfere with the character’s form or visual balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no speech text visible in Image B. Hence, there are no potential issues with alignment or interference with the character’s form or visual balance. The absence of text ensures that the focus remains on the character and the composition itself.",
