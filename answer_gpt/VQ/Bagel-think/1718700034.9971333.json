      "question": "Are the crystal shards forming the wings symmetrically aligned and structurally coherent, without visible gaps, misaligned facets, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are composed of crystal shards that are visually symmetrical and well-structured on both sides of the figure. The crystals are evenly distributed, and the facets appear to be aligned without any visible gaps or distortions. This coherence indicates an attention to structural integrity in the editing process.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden leafy strands in Image B seem to be carefully placed along the contours of the hair, blending naturally without any visible floating or mismatched sections. The leaves appear to follow the natural flow of the hairstyle, enhancing the overall composition without appearing disjointed or artificially placed.",

      "question": "Does the shirt display a uniform, soft velvet texture with natural shadowing and no repeating patterns or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt has an appearance typical of a velvet fabric, with a consistent soft texture. The garment shows natural shadowing consistent with lighting on velvet material, and there are no noticeable repeating patterns or digital artifacts disrupting its fabric representation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is uniformly a deep gray color, which provides a clean and seamless backdrop free from any visible edges or lighting inconsistencies. There are no traceable remnants of any previous scenes or disruptive anomalies, indicating a well-executed background edit.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all edited elements appear well-aligned with the body, maintaining a cohesive visual flow. The crystal wings, golden leaf embellishments, and velvet shirt integrate seamlessly without any detectable clipping, overlapping mistakes, or positional distortions, demonstrating precise editing work.",
