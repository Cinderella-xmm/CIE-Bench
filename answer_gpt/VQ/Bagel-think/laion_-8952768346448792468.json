      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the gown worn by the central figure have natural fabric folds and realistic embroidery patterns that follow the contours of her body without visible distortion or floating textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gown has a textured appearance consistent with a stylized illustration rather than realistic fabric. The folds and embroidery patterns appear exaggerated and do not follow the natural contours of the body closely; they display distortion and a floating texture. These indicate an artistic rendering, not a realistic portrayal. Therefore, we conclude that the gown does not have natural fabric folds and realistic embroidery patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hair of the central figure styled in a manner consistent with Renaissance fashion, with smooth transitions, no unnatural clumping, and realistic flow under gravity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure's hair is styled in an ornate manner typical of Renaissance fashion, with some semblance of pinned up or adorned style. However, the transitions are not smooth and appear clumped with some parts looking unnatural, possibly due to artistic interpretation through painterly texture. The depiction lacks realistic flow under gravity, reflecting a stylized approach rather than a natural one.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the figures in the background dressed in Elizabethan-style garments with correctly proportioned sleeves, collars, and body shapes, and do they maintain anatomical alignment without limbs appearing distorted or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows figures in the background dressed in attire that resembles Elizabethan-style garments, including features like collars and puffed sleeves. However, upon closer examination, the proportions and body shapes seem altered or exaggerated, resulting in some anatomical misalignment where limbs and garments appear distorted. This artistic style impacts the precision of proportions and alignment.",

      "question": "Does the background feature a cobblestone ground with consistent stone size and spacing, and does it include architectural elements like arches or columns that align properly with perspective and scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a cobblestone ground where the stones show inconsistent size and spacing failing to maintain a realistic pattern. There are some architectural elements present, but they do not align properly with perspective and scale, departing from a realistic portrayal possibly due to the art style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the oil paint texture applied consistently across all surfaces, preserving fine details such as fabric weave, facial features, and architectural lines without visible smudging or over-smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a painting-style texture across surfaces, but the consistency varies, especially in fine details like fabric weave and architectural lines. The painting approach leads to visible smudging or over-smoothing, losing detail necessary for realistic depiction.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the hands of the central figure show five fingers per hand with natural knuckle definition, skin texture, and positioning consistent with human anatomy, without extra digits or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure's hands are depicted with some artistic embellishment. Although they appear to have five fingers per hand, the definition of knuckles and skin texture is not realistic. There is noticeable bending and stylization inconsistent with human anatomy, highlighting an artistic interpretation rather than precision.",
