      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the standing cat’s body exhibit a uniformly soft, plush-like texture with exaggeratedly round and fluffy features throughout, without any visible patches of natural fur or inconsistent material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing cat is designed to look like a plush toy, indicated by its round and fluffy features. The body seems uniformly soft, typical of plush toys, without visible patches of natural fur or inconsistent material transitions. Plush toys usually have a consistent texture due to the fabric used in their construction, and this image follows that pattern with its exaggerated roundness and smooth surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes of both cats replaced with small, shiny, circular button-like objects and the noses with flat, felt-like shapes that are proportionally appropriate and seamlessly integrated into the plush form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of both cats appear as small, shiny, circular objects resembling buttons, which is typical for plush toys aiming to mimic a friendly appearance. The noses look flat and felt-like, appearing seamless and proportionally appropriate for the plush form. These features are commonly used in plush toys to convey simplicity and cuteness.",

      "question": "Is the red shopping cart correctly scaled to fit the toy-sized cats and does it retain proper geometric structure with undistorted bars, wheels, and handle, without any broken or warped components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a red shopping cart scaled appropriately to match the toy-sized cats. The geometric structure of the cart is intact with properly designed bars, wheels, and handle, which suggest it is a miniature but accurate representation of a real shopping cart, fitting well within the context of toy usage without distortion or broken components.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of vivid, lush green foliage with natural textures and lighting that provide a clear contrast to the toy cats without any unnatural color shifts or blurred edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a background with vivid, lush green foliage. The colors appear natural, with good lighting that enhances the contrast between the background and the toy cats. There are no apparent unnatural color shifts or blurred edges in the foliage, contributing to a realistic outdoor setting despite the presence of the plush toys.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the standing cat’s front paws properly grip the handle of the trolley in a stable and anatomically plausible manner for a plush toy figure, without unnatural bending or stretching of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing cat's front paws are positioned to grip the handle of the trolley in a manner consistent with the design of a plush toy, suggesting a stable and intentional positioning. Plush toys tend not to have joints for realistic movement, but the positioning appears anatomically plausible within this context, without visible unnatural bending or stretching of limbs.",
