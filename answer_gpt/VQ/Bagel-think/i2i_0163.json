      "question": "Does the outdoor camping scene seamlessly integrate with the toasters, maintaining consistent lighting and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters are placed in an outdoor camping scene with a backdrop of natural elements and sunlight. The sunlight is evident with the bright sky and casting shadows, which match the light reflections on the metal surface of the toasters. The consistency of lighting and shadows between the sunlight and the reflections on the toasters supports a seamless integration of the toasters into the outdoor scene. Generally, the shadows and lighting of the toasters correspond with the outdoor lighting conditions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the toasters placed naturally on the folding table without any visible distortion in the table's texture or structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters are positioned on a folding table as part of the camping setup. The image does not show any warping or distortion of the table where the toasters are placed, indicating that the placement is natural without causing any visible alteration in the texture or structure of the table. The table's structure, including its surface and legs, appears consistent and undistorted, suggesting a natural placement of the toasters.",

      "question": "Do the sunlight effects on the toast create realistic highlights and shadows on both the toast and surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunlight in the camping scene should cast realistic highlights and shadows on the toast and other objects like the toasters. The visual cues show consistent and natural lighting effects, such as highlights that suggest the direction and strength of the sunlight. Shadows are cast appropriately, aligning with the overall lighting setup seen in the outdoor environment. This indicates that the sunlight effects create realistic highlights and shadows consistent with the outdoor setting.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the outdoor camping background and the foreground elements smooth, without any noticeable artifacts or missing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the transition between the toasters in the foreground and the natural outdoor background includes checking for visual continuity and any artifacts at the boundaries. The transition appears smooth with no obvious lines, edges, or artifacts that would suggest manipulation or layering errors. The elements blend together without noticeable discrepancies in lighting, color, or detail level, creating a seamless connection between foreground and background.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the proportions and shapes of the toasters remained intact and physically plausible in the new outdoor camping scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to natural settings and expectations based on world knowledge of typical toaster shapes and sizes, the toasters maintain their original proportions and shapes in the outdoor context. There is no visible distortion or alteration in their physical appearance that would be considered implausible. They look consistent with standard toaster dimensions relative to other elements in the outdoor scene, such as the table and surrounding environment.",
