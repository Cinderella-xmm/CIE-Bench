      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the body of the seahorse exhibit a consistent translucent pink glass appearance with visible subtle bubble textures, and are there no areas where the texture appears jagged, inconsistent, or artificially applied?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the seahorse's body visually resembles a glass-like finish with a semi-reflective surface, and the material seems opaque rather than translucent. However, there are regions that exhibit inconsistent shading and texture, suggesting the application might not be purely glass-like and appears somewhat artificial in areas. Image A shows a plush texture, indicating the glass-like finish in Image B is an edit. Considering visual consistency and natural material behavior, the seahorse exhibits inconsistencies in texture across the body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the yellow belly rendered as a smooth, opaque glass surface with a precisely etched music note inside a heart, and are the edges of the symbol clean without blurring or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse's yellow belly appears smooth and consistent, resembling an opaque glass surface with a vibrant color. The symbol inside a heart is notably clean, with sharp edges, free from visible blurring or deformation effects seen in some digital renderings. In Image A, the belly is consistent plastic, supporting that the edited appearance in Image B is smooth and approximating a glass-like finish with precise detailing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ribbons on the head and fins rendered as solid lavender glass with smooth surfaces and light reflections, and do they maintain their original shape without warping or appearing stretched or flattened?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the ribbons retain their expected shape, color, and texture, resembling solid lavender glass. They exhibit smooth surfaces with light reflections, maintaining the appearance typical of glass objects. Image A shows that these ribbons were fabric elements; thus, the edited version mimics glass effectively without warping, aligning with the description of a glass material transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the seahorse positioned on a flat, reflective black surface that shows clear mirror-like reflections of its base and lower body, and is the stand seamlessly integrated without gaps or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the seahorse positioned on a black stand with a glossy, reflective surface. While the stand itself appears flat and reflective, delivering some mirror-like reflection, the integration between the seahorse base and the stand shows signs of editing. The stand does not entirely present seamless integration, as there seems to be a minor floating effect and lack of natural contact, which contrasts from a real-world setup. Image A does not feature a stand, implying it's an edit, revealing the integration isn't wholly seamless.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all elements—body, belly, fins, ribbons, and base—visually consistent in lighting, shadow, and material properties, with no mismatched highlights, color shifts, or artificial edges suggesting poor blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, mismatched attributes concerning lighting, shadows, and material properties are noticeable. The body, belly, fins, ribbons, and stand exhibit uneven lighting and inconsistencies in material realism. Edge blending in some regions appears coarse, hinting at editing discrepancies. Image A has consistent lighting and materials typical of the original plush. Consequently, inconsistencies in highlights, colors, and blending are evident in B, suggesting editing anomalies.",
