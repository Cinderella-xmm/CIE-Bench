      "question": "Are the transitions between the man's clothing and the cow's fur smooth and free of unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the man's clothing and the cow's fur is visually consistent and smooth, indicating a careful editing process. The man's white coat and the cow's fur maintain distinct boundaries without revealing significant signs of digital manipulation. The blending of textures between these elements is done in a way that appears natural and seamless, with no visible artifacts that would otherwise suggest an abrupt transition.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the combined figure, including the size of the horns relative to the body, appear physically plausible and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow's physical proportions, including the horns relative to the body, remain consistent with what is expected of a real cow. The editing does not introduce any distortion that alters the horn sizes unnaturally. The size and placement of the horns are visually proportional to the rest of the cow's body, maintaining a realistic appearance consistent with the natural anatomy of the breed.",

      "question": "Are the details of the man's white coat and the cow's fur well-preserved and free from unnatural blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details of both the man's white coat and the cow's fur remain sharp and clearly defined. The fur of the cow retains its texture and appearance, characterized by identifiable individual strands and a natural look. There is no evidence of blurring or pixelation that commonly results from inadequate image processing or poor resolution, which indicates the edited image maintains the clarity of these details effectively.",

      "question": "Does the posture of the combined figure, including the positioning of the legs and head, appear natural and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the posture of the cow and the positioning of its legs and head are natural and consistent with what is seen in the original image. The positioning of the legs and head are coherent with the motion depicted as they move forward. The cowâ€™s stride and the relative positioning of the man are consistent with the behavior of leading an animal, preserving a dynamic sense of movement that appears realistic.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement of the combined figure within the scene, including its interaction with the grass and background, appear visually credible and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow and the man are placed within the scene in a manner that integrates naturally with the surrounding grass and background. The figure interacts logically with the grass beneath, showing appropriate shadowing and grounding. The relationship to the background, including other spectators and elements in the environment, suggests a natural placement without distortions or discrepancies, lending credibility to the edited image.",
