    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the robot's body exhibit smooth, continuous chrome-like surfaces without visible texture breaks or inconsistent material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot features stylized, angular surfaces typical of an abstract or geometric art style. This style focuses on distinct shapes and facets rather than smooth transitions, suggesting an artistic interpretation rather than realistic portrayal. The surfaces are designed with consistent angular forms rather than smooth, continuous chrome-like appearances.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the flamingos rendered as cohesive geometric shapes with consistent edges and proportions, without fragmented or disconnected components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flamingos are illustrated using cohesive geometric shapes, with consistent angular and stylized proportions. The edges are neat, and the overall style adheres to an artistic geometric style, ensuring the flamingos appear as unified figures without fragmented parts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the palm trees and rocks in the background have angular, stylized forms that maintain consistent perspective and spatial relationships without appearing disjointed or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background elements in Image B, like palm trees and rocks, are illustrated using geometric and angular forms, maintaining a consistent perspective typical of stylized art. The spatial relationships are artistically coherent, and elements do not appear disjointed or misplaced; rather, they fit the stylization smoothly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the color palette across the entire scene consistently muted and pastel-toned, with no areas exhibiting sudden or jarring color deviations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B is uniform and pastel-toned, typical of an abstract art style. Colors are used consistently throughout the image, maintaining harmony and avoiding any sudden or disruptive color changes, ensuring a smooth visual flow.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the robot's hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural curvature and spacing, and no extra or malformed digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, following the geometric abstract style, the robot's hands do not exhibit naturally curved or spaced fingers, as they are likely represented in simplified forms. Therefore, they do not have five distinct, naturally curved fingers each.",

      "model_answer": "No",
