    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior maintain accurate limb proportions and body structure without distorted joints or exaggerated features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D model's limbs and body structure appear to be in proper proportions typical of a well-executed digital sculpture. The limbs are of consistent thickness, and there are no noticeable distortions or exaggerated features common in stylistically exaggerated models. The anatomy appears normal for a humanoid figure, based on my visual assessment and general knowledge of 3D modeling.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the metallic blue surfaces of the armor rendered with natural light reflections and depth, avoiding flat or uniform coloring?",
    "explanation": "The metallic blue armor in Image B shows reflections and highlights that indicate some degree of depth and texture. Instead of appearing flat, the surfaces have varied shading, suggesting light interaction, which is typical in rendering metallic surfaces. This gives the armor a realistic metallic feel.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the trident positioned correctly in the hand and scaled appropriately relative to the figure, without bending or truncation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trident is positioned naturally within the characterâ€™s hand, looking as though it's being securely gripped. The scale of the trident seems proportionate to the figure, where it neither overwhelms the model nor appears too small. This gives the impression of a correctly modeled accessory.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the dome enclosing the model have smooth curvature and consistent transparency without visible stitching, warping, or reflection anomalies?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict a dome enclosing the model; rather, it features an open display. Thus, there are no issues with stitching, warping, or reflection anomalies as could be evaluated if a dome were present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the coral reef base textured with natural-looking organic patterns and scaled appropriately to support the model without appearing undersized or oversized?",
    "explanation": "The coral reef base in Image B appears to have a naturalistic texture, consisting of rounded, organically shaped forms representative of real coral reefs. The base's scale aligns well with the model, providing a suitable platform that neither undermines nor overpowers the figure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the swirling ocean currents around the model follow continuous, directional flow paths without abrupt breaks or floating fragments?",
    "explanation": "Image B emphasizes the stationary elements of the ocean floor rather than depicting swirling ocean currents. Therefore, it does not present any issues of discontinuity or fragmentation regarding ocean currents.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the hand holding the trident have exactly five fingers with natural joint angles and grip pressure, without extra digits or unnatural bends?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hand grasping the trident shows a realistic number of five fingers. The fingers are flexed in a typical manner for holding an object, with no extra digits or awkward, unnatural bends visible, suggesting careful attention to anatomical accuracy in the model.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are all elements (model, dome, base, currents) spatially aligned and layered correctly, with no floating or disconnected parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elements that are present, such as the model and the coral reef base, appear to be aligned and integrated effectively. There are no visible gaps, misalignments, or floating elements which indicate a cohesive composition within these aspects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
