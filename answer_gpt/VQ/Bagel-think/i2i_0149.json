      "question": "Does the cat's head extend naturally out of the frame without any visible artifacts or unrealistic stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's head looks proportionate and naturally positioned without any visible signs of digital manipulation such as stretching or artifacts. The head blends well with the rest of the body and the frame. The consistency of proportions and edges aligns with my understanding of a realistic and natural imagery of a cat, suggesting that the head does extend naturally out of the frame.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the curled tongue depicted with natural texture and spatial depth, enhancing the illusion of it peeking out from the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's tongue appears curled and has visible texture and depth, which contributes to a realistic appearance. The lighting on the tongue gives it a three-dimensional look and fits well with the rest of the image, enhancing the illusion of a natural, protruding tongue.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadow on the cat's extended head and curled tongue consistent with the rest of the image, contributing to a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows on the cat's head and tongue are consistent with those observed on other parts of the cat's body. The direction and intensity of shadowing seem coherent with the primary light source in the image, maintaining a visually harmonious composition which supports the natural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cat's eyes, ears, and whiskers appear proportionate and undistorted, contributing to the visual plausibility of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes, ears, and whiskers of the cat are proportionate and show no signs of distortion. The eyes are symmetrically placed, the ears retain their shape, and the whiskers extend naturally, all contributing to the image's credibility and visual plausibility.",

      "question": "Does the cat's fur texture and color remain natural and unaltered, ensuring the visual authenticity of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur texture and color appear consistent and natural throughout, without any signs of digital editing that would alter its authenticity. The light and shadow on the fur maintain a realistic texture, supporting the visual integrity of the image.",
