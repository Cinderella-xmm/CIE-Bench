    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the snow-capped peak exhibit a consistent, non-uniform glittering texture that mimics natural snow while avoiding blocky or artificial sparkles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow-capped peak is observed to have an overly stylized texture, with bold, patterned lines evident on the snow, giving a rather artificial appearance as opposed to a natural glittering texture. Natural snow should reflect light in a non-uniform way, creating subtle changes rather than distinct, blocky patterns. Thus, the peak does not display a true-to-life natural texture as expected in a mountain's snowy area.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree lines and grasslands along the base of the mountain rendered with natural variation in color and density, without repeating brush-like strokes or artificial line artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree lines and grasslands appear as stylized forms, with a repetitive and uniform texture suggesting brush-like strokes or patterns rather than a natural variation in a forest or grassland. In a natural setting, such elements would have irregularities and subtle differences in color and density, which are missing in this edited version. This stylistic rendering does not convincingly mimic the complexities seen in actual diverse vegetation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lake surface uniformly reflective with no visible distortion, warping, or artificial shine that breaks the continuity of the mountain's reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows the lake with a somewhat distorted reflection. The surface appears more abstract and lacks the continuous quality of reflection typically seen in water surfaces. The reflection lacks the smooth gradation and has clear demarcation lines and blurred sections, which break the expected continuity of a direct natural reflection.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the chalet figurines positioned at ground level along the shoreline with proper scale and shadow alignment, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chalet figurines are depicted in a dollhouse-like style that gives them a toy-like appearance, suggesting they may not be at true ground level relative to other elements in the image. Scale and shadow do not seem naturally aligned; the lighting direction is not realistically influencing the shadows and the scale when compared to the rest of the image elements. Thus, they do not appear naturally integrated into the scene.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, distortions, or artificial reflections around the perimeter of the scene that suggest an unnatural glass boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, there are certain irregularities and distortions, especially noticeable around the perimeter of the reflection, which hint at an unnatural boundary. The reflection and the boundaries have a more digital, manipulated texture, typical in edited images, as opposed to seamless natural vistas.",
