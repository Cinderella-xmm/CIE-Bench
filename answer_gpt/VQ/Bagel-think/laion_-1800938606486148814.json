    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transparent upper material appear smooth and uniform without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent opacity across the shoe's surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe design features a neon, glowing digital circuit pattern overlaid on what appears to be a non-transparent material. The focus is on the intricate glow patterns and neon aesthetics rather than transparency. There are no visible inconsistencies or pixelation in the presentation of this digital effect. Based on the clear and sharp visual design, the material indeed appears smooth and uniform, especially at this resolution.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the neon blue glow around the Swoosh evenly distributed with smooth transitions and no abrupt color shifts or light leaks into neighboring surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the Nike Swoosh is illuminated with a consistent neon blue glow. The transitions from the glow into the surrounding material are smooth, with no visible leaks or abrupt changes in color intensity, maintaining a clean and visually appealing effect. This uniformity suggests careful attention to design detail in controlling light effects.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the digital screen on the strap properly aligned with the strapâ€™s curvature, showing clear and stable animation content without pixelation or visual noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a section on the shoe that appears to represent a digital display on the strap. The design seems to be consistent with the curvature of the strap and presents digital-like elements with clarity, without noticeable pixelation or noise. This suggests that the digital screen effect is well-implemented and aligned with the shoe's physical structure.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the digital shoe box exhibit consistent geometry and metallic reflection patterns without warped edges or misaligned holographic layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a digital-like shoe box displayed next to the shoe. The box showcases consistent geometry, and the reflections appear uniform and appropriately angular, aligning with the typical presentation of a digital or holographic display. There are no apparent warps or misalignments in the edges or holographic visuals, indicating precise rendering.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the shoe box evenly spaced and aligned with the surface contours, without repeating anomalies or misregistration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe box exhibits geometric patterns that are evenly spaced and aligned with the contours of its surface. The patterns follow the presumed three-dimensional form of the box with no evident misalignments or patterning errors that would indicate repetition anomalies. This suggests careful attention to alignment and spacing.",
