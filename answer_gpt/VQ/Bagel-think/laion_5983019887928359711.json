    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the hair exhibit consistent curl patterns and volumetric continuity without visible distortions such as broken strands, unnatural bulges, or abrupt changes in thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair shows consistent curl patterns typical of a chibi art style, characterized by exaggerated and rounded features. The curls are smooth and voluminous, maintaining a continuous flow without noticeable breaks or irregular bulges. This suggests a stylistic choice rather than an error, consistent with representations in toys or figurines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the golden embroidery patterns evenly spaced and continuous along the red coat, with no jagged edges or missing segments that suggest artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden embroidery on the red coat presents a stylized and simplified pattern reflective of a chibi figure, where detailing is often reduced for aesthetic simplicity. The patterns appear continuous, evenly spaced, and free of jagged edges or breaks, aligning with a polished and consistent design expected in such representations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the blue sash follow a smooth, gravity-consistent drape from the shoulder to the waist without unnatural creases or overlapping inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue sash is drawn to appear smoothly flowing over the shoulder and across the body without showing sharp creases or sections overlapping in an unnatural way. This aligns with the simplified and flowing representation typical of chibi figures, suggesting a coherent style rather than a physical drape, as seen in realistic fabrics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the coat, sash, and skin show coherent shading and specular reflections that align with a single light source, avoiding inconsistent gloss or floating highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses consistent shading on the coat, sash, and skin surfaces, typical of a digital render or illustration of a chibi-style figure. The gloss and highlights follow a uniform directionality, suggesting a coherent light source, which avoids the floating or misplaced highlights that are indicative of artifacting or inconsistent detailing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the white lace cravat properly aligned with the neck and collar, with no distortion, clipping, or unnatural stretching of the lace pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white lace cravat is represented in a manner where it aligns neatly with the neck and collar area without any visible distortion or unnatural stretching. This suggests a stylistically deliberate portrayal rather than a physical representation, fitting with the characteristic simplicity and neatness of chibi designs.",
