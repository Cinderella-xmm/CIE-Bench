    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the limbs of the chibi character straight and properly connected at joints, with no visible kinks or disproportionate lengths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the chibi character appear cartoonish and exaggerated in style, typical of chibi designs. The arms and legs are short and rounded, meant to create a cute effect rather than realistic anatomy. However, they are consistent with the intended style, as there are no visible kinks or disproportionate lengths within this context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the face of the chibi character have symmetrical eyes and a clearly defined mouth, with no distorted lines or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face of the chibi character is stylized to have features characteristic of chibi art. While specific symmetrical details like eyes and mouth aren't visible due to the blur, the absence of distorted lines or unnatural shading outside the blur indicate a likely symmetrical and clear design in line with chibi conventions.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the kimono clearly visible with sharp edges and no color smudging or pixelation, even after color enhancement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns on the chibi character's kimono in Image B are clearly depicted with well-defined shapes and vibrant colors. The edges appear sharp, and there is no noticeable smudging or pixelation. This suggests that any color enhancement has preserved the clarity and quality of the floral patterns.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hand holding the cherry blossom branch composed of five fingers with natural curvature and no extra digits or deformed shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand of the chibi character holding the cherry blossom branch is simplified and not anatomically detailed, fitting within the chibi style. However, from the visual cues, the hand holds the branch correctly as per its style with no extra digits or deformation visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the falling petals in the dancing pose follow a downward arc consistent with gravity, and are they evenly distributed without clustering or floating above the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The falling petals in Image B are shown distributing around the chibi character in a way that suggests dynamic motion. They appear in a distributed pattern, consistent with a natural fall, and do not show unnatural clustering or floating that would defy gravity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pastel-colored background of the magnetic sheet in Image B appears smooth and consistent, with no visible artifacts, stripes, or noticeable color shifts. The pastel hues are well-blended, providing a uniform background for the chibi figures.",
      "weight": 1,

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All four chibi figures in Image B are fully visible within the magnetic sheet's dimensions. They are evenly spaced without any overlap or cut-off edges, ensuring that each figure is distinct and comprehensible.",
