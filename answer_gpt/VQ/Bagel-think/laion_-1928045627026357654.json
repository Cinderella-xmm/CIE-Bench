    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the male's shirt display a consistent 3D plush texture with no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural shading that breaks the illusion of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the male character is represented by a stylized 3D figure, which inherently suggests the absence of realistic textures. The shirt appears smooth and cartoonish, mirroring the textual pattern but lacks a realistic plush texture. Such stylized figures do not include detailed textures, and instead focus on uniform surfaces. Therefore, there is no plush texture, as the image uses a consistent stylized approach.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the collar of the male's shirt proportionally enlarged without distorting the neck or shoulder line, and does it maintain smooth contours without sharp or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized 3D representation where the shirt's collar is smoothly integrated into the cartoon figure. The collar doesn't cause any visible distortion of the neck or shoulder line and appears proportionately larger due to its design style, with contours remaining smooth and clean as per the stylized aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the pleats on the female's pants symmetrically arranged and physically plausible, without floating or overlapping layers that defy gravity or fabric tension?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the female figure's skirt features exaggerated pleats characteristic of a stylized, cartoon-like design. These pleats are symmetrically arranged and appear neatly in line with the figure’s design, maintaining a physically plausible appearance as per the stylistic constraints. Given the artistic representation, they comply fully with cartoon physics and style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the enlarged sleeve on the female’s top extend naturally from the shoulder without distorting her arm or causing unnatural gaps or overlaps near the elbow and hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the female figure's sleeve is simplified and naturally extends from the shoulder as per the cartoonish design. The sleeve is proportionally larger, which is normal in stylized models, and it doesn't create any noticeable distortion or unnatural overlaps in the arms, maintaining a consistent cartoon appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the pastel-colored stage beneath the characters evenly lit and proportionally scaled, with no abrupt color shifts or shadow inconsistencies that suggest poor integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pastel-colored stage beneath the characters in Image B reflects a uniform lighting and color scheme that matches the stylized setting. There is no evidence of discoloration or harsh shadow transitions. The scaling appears proportionate within the context of a stylized 3D figure display, ensuring consistent integration with the characters.",
