      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the quilt display uniform square blocks with visible grid lines and a matte finish consistent with LEGO bricks, without any fabric-like folds or stitching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt appears to be made of LEGO bricks arranged with visible patterns resembling the layout of LEGO. There are no visible fabric-like folds or stitching, and the bricks have a typical matte finish associated with LEGO. This conclusion is drawn from the distinct rectangular brick shapes and textures visualized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the round sports elements (e.g., football, soccer ball) represented as circular LEGO tiles with consistent size and alignment within the square grid, without stretching or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the elements that once appeared as sports balls in Image A are not clearly identifiable as round LEGO tiles but rather part of a grid of colorful LEGO bricks. There is no clear representation of round sports elements, which suggests that these features are conveyed differently, unlike typical circular LEGO tiles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the pillow replaced by a cube composed of stacked LEGO bricks with equal dimensions on all sides, right angles, and no visible gaps or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pillow is replaced by a formation of LEGO bricks that form a rectangular shape but not an exact cube. While it seems to be made up of LEGO bricks stacked with visible right angles and a typical LEGO consistency, it does not appear to be perfectly cubical. Thus, its edges do not show equal dimensions on all sides.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bed base a flat, white, seamless surface with no visible wood grain, shadows, or depth cues, resembling a standard LEGO baseplate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a bed with a base that is consistent with LEGO elements. It appears flat and the surface conveys a LEGO baseplate texture, showing typical block connections but does not possess any visible wood grains or natural shadows. This analysis arises from the recognizable features of a LEGO texture rather than any standard bedding structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire background a smooth, uniform white surface with no visible walls, furniture, or windows, and are there no shadows or lighting gradients indicating a physical space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the background elements of walls, furniture, and windows from Image A. The room is still visible, with the surroundings unchanged in terms of walls, window details, and furniture, demonstrating shadows and lighting consistent with a physical space. Therefore, the background is not a smooth, uniform white surface.",
