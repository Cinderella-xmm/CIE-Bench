      "question": "Does the boundary where the character appears to break out of the television screen show no obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a neon-lit frame, creating an impression that the character is emerging from a screen or boundary defined by light. Upon inspecting the boundary, the transition between the character's figure and the lighted background appears seamless, with no evident signs of pixelation, artifacts, or unnatural textures interrupting the scene. This seamless transition contributes to a visually cohesive appearance.",

      "question": "Is the shield held in a manner that complements the character's posture without introducing distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character holding the shield upright and angled slightly forwards, consistent with a defensive posture. When examining the shield's geometry, the circular shape is preserved with well-defined concentric circles and a central star, showing no distortion or irregularities. The shield's positioning complements the character's balanced stance, reinforcing the dynamic pose.",

      "question": "Are the lighting and reflections on the character's suit consistent with the environment, avoiding any loss of details or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the bright, neon-lit frame sets the lighting context. The character's suit reflects light appropriately, with distinct shadows and highlights that enhance the suit's detailed design—such as the star emblem and shield surface. The lighting and reflections on the suit contribute to a realistic interaction with the environment, without any loss of detail or digital artifacts.",

      "question": "Do the visible parts of the character’s body maintain proper proportions, avoiding distortion or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is depicted with a robust, muscular physique typical of superhero portrayals. Its proportions, from the broad shoulders to the tapering waist, are consistent with an athletic build. The substantial presence of the suit contributes to a realistic portrayal of the character, without any evident distortion or scaling issues affecting body proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the addition of the character breaking out of the screen maintain the visual continuity of the background and avoid disrupting other elements in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is stylized with a neon-lit frame. The character's presence aligns visually with this frame without causing disruptions to the scene's integral elements. The harmonious interaction of the neon lights with the character's position, particularly lighting effects, indicates maintained visual continuity. The character's emergence does not interrupt the cohesive visual aesthetic of the image.",
