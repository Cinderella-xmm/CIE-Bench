      "question": "Does the unfurled scroll form of the map maintain smooth, continuous curvature without jagged edges or distorted grid lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scroll is depicted as unfurling from the bottom of the map. Observing its curvature, it appears smooth and continuous, consistent with how scrolls typically unfurl. There are no noticeable jagged edges or distortions in the grid lines, indicating that the design maintains a clean and professional look. When comparing with Image A, it is clear that the smooth nature of unfurling has been intentionally designed without any distortion that could detract from the mapâ€™s aesthetics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the spokes of the ship's wheel evenly spaced, structurally intact, and consistent in thickness and metallic texture with the original compass material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship's wheel is added with spokes that are evenly spaced, providing a symmetrical look that adheres to the principles of design for such objects. The spokes are structurally intact, and their texture matches the metallic and ornate style evident in the original compass in Image A. The wheel appears solid and consistent with the existing style, showing that the addition was done with careful attention to compatibility with the compass's details.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the silhouettes of the explorers clearly distinguishable, proportionally small relative to the map scale, and placed along plausible travel paths without overlapping key geographical labels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouettes of the explorers in Image B are clearly distinguishable as various figures, likely representing different characters or roles within an exploration team. They are proportionally small, aligning with the map's scale rather than overpowering it. Their placement along plausible paths further supports the idea of an exploration narrative, and they do not overlap important geographical labels. This strategic positioning complements the map's storytelling element without detracting from its readability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the typography aligned with the vintage aesthetic, free from pixelation or blurring, and positioned so that it does not obscure major elements such as the compass or continental outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typography at the top of the map appears to be consistent with the vintage aesthetic resembling old-world cartography titles. The text is sharp, free from pixelation or blurring, maintaining the integrity and readability of the map. Its positioning at the top has been done thoughtfully, ensuring it does not obscure major elements like the compass or the map outlines, supporting the overall design while enhancing the thematic elements rather than detracting from them.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the red dotted lines form continuous, non-overlapping paths across the map that align with known historical exploration routes and avoid cutting through landmasses or key symbols?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red dotted lines are used to illustrate exploration paths, but they appear to overlap with areas of water and land without clear adherence to historical exploration routes. These paths intersect some geographical symbols and parts of the map without clearly avoiding key landmasses, displaying more artistic creativity than historical accuracy. The lines show intention in connecting exploration points, but the design prioritizes aesthetic impact over strict adherence to historical exploration routes.",
