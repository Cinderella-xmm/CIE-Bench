      "question": "Has the removal of the second zebra and grassland resulted in a clean transition without visible artifacts or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the analysis of Image B, the snow-covered ground in the outdoor setting of the ski race is replaced with a bright green color. The transition appears to lack visible artifacts or unnatural edges, as the shape of the participant and the surrounding elements like the 'START' banner are consistent, suggesting careful editing. This cleanly altered environment does not exhibit visible seams or awkward transitions where the green color ends and the remainder of the image begins.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the green gradient plane replacing the grass blend seamlessly with the zebra and ground, maintaining natural gradients and avoiding sharp contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowy ground is replaced with a bright green gradient. The shift in color doesn't truly represent a natural gradient because it starkly contrasts with the rest of the image. The different portions of the scene (sky, trees, and participant) have maintained their original appearances while the green is uniformly applied, lacking seamless blending or transitional gradients.",

      "question": "Is the zebra on the left intact and proportionally correct, with no signs of distortion or unnatural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of a zebra is not applicable in Image B, which depicts a skiing participant. The addition of the green background does not suggest that the participant or other elements have undergone distortion. The person crossing the start line appears proportionate with regard to the scene, while textures like their clothes and skis are preserved.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the details of the zebra's stripes and the ground's texture well-preserved, ensuring high-quality representation without loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Details about zebra stripes are irrelevant in Image B. However, the scene retains details of the participant, such as the clothing texture and elements like a numbered vest, the 'START' banner, and the poles. The green background doesn't commit to realistic texture replication, but other elements remain detailed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the final composition effectively convey a calm and solitary atmosphere without any elements disrupting the visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a consistent composition with the participant engaged in a solitary sporting activity under a clear sky. Despite the stark replacement of the snowy landscape with green, the image retains visual harmony in terms of the participant's interaction with the sport environment under relaxed conditions, though the green changes the original setting's tone.",
