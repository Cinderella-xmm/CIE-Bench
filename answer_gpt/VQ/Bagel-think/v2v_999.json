      "question": "Do the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls along the edge of the bathtub blend naturally with the bathroom setting without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls are placed on the edge of the bathtub. By combining world knowledge with visual cues, it's evident that the bathroom's typical purpose and style don't naturally include decorative items like chibi-style dolls, especially on the edge of the bathtub where practical items (like toiletries) are common. This creates a noticeable contrast, indicating that these dolls don't blend naturally with the setting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls consistent with the rest of the bathroom elements, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Russian nesting dolls have a glossy, painted texture, contrasting with the matte and earthy tones of the bathroom's tile, wood, and fixtures. The consistency in materials is important for cohesion in visual design; hence, the bright and shiny texture of the dolls creates an inconsistency. This indicates the textures don't match the rest of the bathroom elements, creating a visual artifact.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and arrangement of the five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls along the bathtub edge logically consistent and visually credible, without any distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style dolls in Image B are evenly spaced along the bathtub edge and have a consistent look, with distinct shapes characteristic of traditional Russian nesting dolls. Their heights and widths relative to one another appear logical and proportional, maintaining consistent geometric shapes without any discernible distortion or breakage.",

      "question": "Do the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls retain their fine details without introducing any unnatural textures or visual noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls in Image B, they display well-defined details like painted faces and clothing, and their surfaces appear smooth and free from visual noise. Despite being a distinct art style, the details are crisp and clear, maintaining integrity without unnatural artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement of the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls along the bathtub edge respect the spatial constraints and physical logic of the bathroom, avoiding any visual implausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls' placement along the bathtub edge in Image B would seem risky in a functioning bathroom due to the risk of them falling. However, examining their alignment and the continuous flat surface along the edge suggests their placement respects spatial constraints in terms of a non-functional display setup, but in terms of practicality within real-world usage, this placement would be impractical.",
