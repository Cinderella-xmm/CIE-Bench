      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the outline of the guitar body remain intact and undistorted after being converted into an armored torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the guitar body retains its general outline, maintaining its shape without distortion despite the added illustrations. The body appears modified into a more stylized form with the illustrated elements but maintains its core shape, resembling an armored torso transformation while not compromising the original guitar shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the metallic finish applied to the guitar body consistent with the original wood grain pattern, showing no signs of artificial texture tiling or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar retains its wooden appearance. The surface visual resembles the wood grain pattern from Image A, with no metallic finish applied. The grain pattern appears consistent throughout, with no signs of texture tiling or artificial reflections, indicating a seamless integration rather than a metallic finish.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the illustrative lines evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the guitar's curvature without overlapping or cutting through structural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrative lines around the guitar body and headstock are consistent and follow the curvature of the guitar. These lines are continuous and do not cut through key structural elements, effectively enhancing the visual style rather than disrupting or overlapping the guitar's elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the strings appear as continuous, taut muscle strands that follow the bodyâ€™s contour without kinks, gaps, or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the strings continue to appear as traditional guitar strings rather than muscle strands. They are appropriately aligned following the guitar's contour, without visual disruptions such as kinks, gaps, or floating segments. This aligns with their original structure seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cape extend naturally from the neck, showing smooth folds and consistent sound wave patterns along its length without abrupt changes or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cape effect is featured at the neck and body and consists of illustrative lines with wave patterns. These extensions appear stylized, with a consistent design flow, showing smooth visual continuity with no abrupt changes or breaks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the emblem on the headstock fully visible, correctly aligned, and not overlapping with the tuning pegs or brand name?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the emblem appears replaced by illustrative lines; therefore, no conventional emblem like seen in Image A is visible. It doesn't overlap with other elements such as tuning pegs or brand name since an emblem isn't depicted, rather the illustrative stylization takes precedence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as pixelation, color bleeding, or sharp discontinuities at the junctions between original guitar parts and added elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is illustrated in a stylized manner, and upon visual inspection, there are no clear artifacts like pixelation or color bleeding. The junctions between the original guitar parts and the added illustrative elements appear visually seamless without sharp discontinuities.",
