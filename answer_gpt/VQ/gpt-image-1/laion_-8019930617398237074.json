      "question": "Does the hand show five fingers with natural positioning and no deformation, and is the bouquet held in a physically plausible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand is positioned naturally and holds a bouquet that conforms to common depictions in art. The illustration accurately represents all five fingers, maintaining natural positioning typical of holding an object securely.

      "question": "Are the watercolor effects evenly distributed without obscuring facial features, dress details, or creating harsh color boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The use of watercolor effects in Image B is indeed spread uniformly throughout the illustration. This style avoids harsh lines, maintaining a gentle transition between colors and details. While facial features are blurred, the overall impression suggests that watercolor techniques generally don't obscure significant features or create stark color demarcations. By understanding the delicate nature of watercolor application, it's clear that the illustration aims to harmonize colors and details without overshadowing them.",

      "question": "Are the embossed edges consistently applied around the image, and is the paper sleeve positioned without overlapping or distorting the main subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the embossed edges surrounding the illustration provide uniformity, which is typical of carefully crafted paper art. The paper sleeve is placed correctly, aligning without interference with the depiction, suggesting that it doesnâ€™t overlap or distort the central illustration of the bride. Understanding typical print and embossing techniques reveals that consistency is key for achieving a clean border and a well-positioned paper sleeve in stationary design.",
