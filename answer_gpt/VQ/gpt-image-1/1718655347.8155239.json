      "question": "Are the golden threads on the moon evenly distributed and seamlessly integrated into the circular shape without visible breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden threads on the moon appear to be evenly distributed around the circular shape of the moon. This can be inferred from the consistent thickness and placement of the threads, which follow the curvature without interruptions or breaks. The integration of the golden threads into the moon suggests a seamless design, indicative of high craftsmanship and attention to detail, ensuring that the overall circularity is maintained.",

      "question": "Do the interlocking geometric shapes on the mountain peaks align properly with the original ridge lines and maintain consistent scale and depth without floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows geometric shapes on the mountain peaks that are interlocking and maintain the original structure's alignment. The scale and depth are consistent, as demonstrated by the even distribution and continuity that reflect a coherent symmetric pattern. The geometric shapes appear intricately sewn, maintaining the image’s intended structural integrity, with no floating or detached elements.",

      "question": "Are the embroidery patterns on the red trees aligned with their original positions and shapes, and do they display consistent thread density and direction without visible flaws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red trees in Image B have embroidery patterns aligned closely with their original positions, as seen by the uniform placement and shape integrity throughout the design. The threads display a consistent density and direction, contributing to a visually pleasing texture without visible errors. This indicates meticulous attention to detail in retaining the adherence to the trees’ original artistic expression.",

      "question": "Do the silvery-blue silk strands follow the natural curvature of the water body and show smooth transitions between sections without abrupt changes in thickness or direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silvery-blue silk strands representing the water body are carefully designed to follow the natural curves and contours. The smooth transitions between sections indicate no abrupt alterations in thickness or direction, signifying skilled craftsmanship that respects the fluid nature of water, consistent with traditional embroidery techniques.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the golden-threaded moon, geometric mountains, embroidered trees, and silk-water all share a consistent artistic style and lighting response without creating visual dissonance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each element in Image B, including the golden-threaded moon, geometric mountains, embroidered trees, and silk-water, harmonizes within a unified artistic style. The embroidery techniques, choice of colors, and lighting responses of these elements preserve a consistent visual theme, avoiding any dissonance or disharmony within the image. The cohesive style reflects the same cultural embroidery art, maintaining aesthetic continuity.",
