      "question": "Do the shoes appear naturally larger without any visible distortion or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoes are designed in a cartoon-like style with exaggerated and smooth features typical of such stylization. The soles are quite large, providing a playful and stylized look. This enlargement is intentional and crafted to fit the cartoon aesthetic rather than trying to reflect real-world proportions. There is no visible distortion or stretching; instead, the larger size is a stylistic choice that appears intentional rather than accidental.",

      "question": "Are the legs depicted in a cartoon-like style while retaining natural textures and avoiding unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs are also styled in a cartoon-like manner, with simple shapes and smooth textures. The fabric and socks exhibit clear, smooth textures typical of this style. The image avoids any jagged lines or pixelation that might indicate artifacts, maintaining a clean and cohesive look characteristic of intentional illustration.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the feet on the cloud-shaped shelf look natural and structurally sound, without any floating or disconnected appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet are placed on a cloud-shaped platform that is part of the overall cartoonish theme. The shoes rest firmly on the cloud-shaped shelf, and there are no gaps or overlapping errors that would suggest floating or a lack of connection. The design is consistent with the intended aesthetic and does not visually appear awkward or disconnected.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the overall composition, including the interaction between the shoes, legs, and clouds, visually credible and free from distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a coherent cartoon style across the entire composition, with each element interacting in a visually cohesive way. The shoes, legs, and clouds are blended seamlessly within the scene's playful context; there is no disruption or inconsistency in their visual relationship. The clouds appear as a stylistic element that supports the design choice, rather than a realistic depiction, fitting well in the overall aesthetic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the textures and fine details of the shoes and legs been preserved, avoiding any unnatural textures or loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B relies heavily on a simplified, stylized representation typical of cartoon themes. As such, the shoes and legs are not detailed in the same way as a realistic image might be; rather, they are smoothed out with fewer textures to match an illustrative style. This doesn't indicate a loss of detail but a design choice, supporting the consistency and aesthetic completeness of the scene.",
