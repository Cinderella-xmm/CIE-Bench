      "question": "Does the angel's facial skin retain smooth, consistent texture and natural coloration without artificial halos, pixelation, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the analysis of Image B, the entire face is blurred, which makes it impossible to evaluate the texture, consistency, or any unnatural elements within the facial area. Without visible features, one cannot confirm if the skin texture and coloration present any artifacts like pixelation or highlights. Therefore, based on the visible parts of the image other than the face, a conclusion about facial skin cannot be made.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added ornate garments visually integrated with the figure’s body, showing realistic draping, fold depth, and material consistency without floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornate garments, including a luxurious red and gold robe, appear to hang naturally on the angel's body. The fabric seems heavy and fits the historical, intricate style of the entire image, suggesting visual integration with the figure's body. The folds and depth of the garment are realistic, and there are no apparent signs of garments floating or disconnecting from the figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the wings appear as subtle, layered highlights that follow the natural curvature of the feathers without creating sharp, unnatural glares or breaking feather edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B are adorned with gold accents that follow the natural curvature of the feathers. The highlights are subtle and layered, enhancing the angelic and ethereal quality of the image without harsh glares or breaking the natural forms of the feather edges. This careful application suggests a sensitivity to the original feather texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the angel’s figure and the new celestial background smooth, with consistent lighting direction and no abrupt edges or mismatched depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a seamless transition between the angel and the celestial background. The lighting direction is consistent throughout the image, with the ambient light enhancing the celestial theme and matching between the figure and environment. There are no abrupt edges or mismatches in depth, which helps maintain the image's harmonious and integrated appearance.",

      "question": "Do the hands show five fingers each with natural joint alignment, proper shadowing, and skin texture without swelling, extra digits, or unnatural contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are positioned naturally with visible fingers that appear proportionate with natural joint alignment. The shadowing is applied consistently, and the skin texture aligns with the overall smooth texture of the other exposed areas. There are no signs of swelling, extra digits, or unnatural contours. The depiction is realistic and integrated with the rest of the image.",
