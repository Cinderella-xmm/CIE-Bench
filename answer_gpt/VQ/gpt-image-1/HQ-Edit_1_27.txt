    "Question": "Q1: Is the Eiffel Tower’s structure preserved with accurate proportions and no geometric distortions despite being scaled down?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is presented as a miniature model within a glass dome. Despite the scale reduction, it maintains the architectural features recognizable from the real Eiffel Tower, such as the truss-like ironwork and the tapering shape. Scaling down the structure within a glass dome inherently alters its size but should not distort its basic proportions or geometric integrity. From the image, the tower looks proportionally accurate with no visible signs of geometric distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a clear, seamless glass dome structure above the scene that fully encloses it without intersecting or distorting any elements?",
    "explanation": "A glass dome structure is depicted in Image B, enclosing the scene that includes the Eiffel Tower, people, and lampposts. The dome appears seamless and clear, typical of what would be expected from a professionally made glass cover. There is no evidence of the dome intersecting or distorting the internal elements, suggesting a well-crafted three-dimensional space that effectively contains the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the snow cover on the ground, trees, and lampposts appear uniformly powdery and free of clumping or artificial texture patterns?",
    "explanation": "The snow cover in Image B appears as a smooth, evenly dispersed layer over the ground, trees, and lampposts. The texture is consistent with freshly fallen snow, without visible clumps or unnatural patterns that could suggest editing artifacts or artificiality. This uniform appearance complements the miniature, serene quality of the snow globe scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are all human figures proportionally small, anatomically correct (including hands with no more than five fingers), and posed in natural stances without deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures are miniaturized consistent with the snow globe theme. They have small, proportional bodies relative to the scaled-down Eiffel Tower and exhibit typical human anatomy without visible deformities. The figures are in naturalistic poses, such as standing, walking, and sitting, with no indications of distortions—such as extra fingers—which ensures adherence to anatomical norms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the streetlamps emit a faint, diffused glow without bright halos or overexposed areas, and are they aligned along the pathway as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "The streetlamps in Image B emit a subtle, diffused glow characteristic of gentle evening light, maintaining a warm, inviting ambiance. There are no bright halos or overexposed spots around them. The lamps are strategically aligned along the pathway, mimicking the placement seen in Image A, suggesting consistency in layout despite the overall miniature scale conversion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are cobblestone textures visibly embedded beneath the snow along the pathways, showing consistent patterns and fine detail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene does not prominently feature cobblestone textures, possibly due to the snow coverage typical in snow globe designs. Thus, any cobblestones beneath such snow would not be visible, leading to an absence of discernible patterns or textures. Consequently, this aspect of the question cannot be observed, resulting in the answer being negative for visible cobblestones.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the tree branches thin, naturally branched, and lightly dusted with snow without sagging or unnatural accumulation?",
    "explanation": "The trees in Image B are portrayed with thin branches that show realistic branching patterns, suitable for a scaled-down environment. The branches have a delicate covering of snow, conveying an authentic winter setting without any perceived weight issues or unnatural buildup. This delicate snow coverage aligns with the artistic miniature style and creates an elegant, realistic scene under the snow globe dome.",
    "answer": "Yes"
