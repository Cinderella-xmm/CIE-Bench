      "question": "Is the outer surface of the globe smooth and uniformly curved without visible distortion or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the globe displays a smooth and uniformly curved surface that is typical of a decorative snow globe. There are no visible distortions or sharp edges, which are inconsistent with globes designed to appear smooth and spherical. This observation leads to the conclusion that the outer surface of the globe is indeed smooth and uniformly curved.",

      "question": "Does the miniature lighthouse inside the globe have accurate window placements and structural symmetry matching the original lighthouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature lighthouse inside the globe in Image B is designed with attention to detail regarding window placements and structural symmetry. It mirrors the general architectural features seen in traditional lighthouses, including proper window alignment and symmetrical build. In a comparison with Image A, the images indicate similar structural designs such as window shapes and positions, confirming that the miniature model accurately reflects these features.",

      "question": "Are the waves made of translucent blue resin visually continuous with smooth surfaces and subtle internal reflections, showing no blocky or fragmented textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waves depicted within the globe in Image B appear smooth and continuous, characteristic of resin-based models used in decorative items like snow globes. These waves have subtle internal reflections, indicative of the translucent material, and there are no visible blocky or fragmented textures. These observations combined with common knowledge about resin models confirm that the waves display smooth surfaces and fluid visual continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden base flat and grounded beneath the globe, with visible wood grain and engraved lines that follow a consistent radial pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base of the globe is flat and grounded, supporting the globe on a stable surface. It features visible wood grain, which is typical of hand-crafted bases, and engraved lines in a radial pattern consistent with the design elements of compass motifs and intricate wooden decorations. These observations, coupled with the understanding of precision craftsmanship, lead to the conclusion that the base displays a consistent radial pattern with distinct wood grain.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the painted clouds and distant mountains located behind the globe, creating a sense of depth without overlapping or intersecting with the globe's surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the clouds and distant mountains in Image B suggests they are painted as part of a background scene intended to create depth, located behind the primary subject, the lighthouse within the globe. They are visually distinct from the globe itself, with no overlapping or intersection that disrupts the foreground/background separation. This arrangement reflects common scene composition techniques, confirming the sense of depth without visual interference.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the rocks display earthy brown and green tones while the water shows vibrant blue with gradient shading, maintaining color harmony across the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rocks in Image B are depicted with earthy tones of brown and green, which is consistent with natural rock formations. The water exhibits vibrant blue hues with gradient shading, typical of artistic representations aiming to portray dynamic navy seas. The choice of colors across these elements maintains harmony and balance throughout the scene, fitting artistic conventions for color theory in landscape modeling. This analysis confirms that the color harmony is maintained across the scene.",
