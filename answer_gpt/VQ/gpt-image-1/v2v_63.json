      "question": "Do the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls accurately reflect the individual's attire and stance without introducing unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls are dressed in attire identical to the individual's, wearing a pink top and jeans, with a similar stance. The design of these dolls does not show any unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes, maintaining the integrity of a typical Russian nesting doll form. Based on this analysis, the nesting dolls accurately represent the individual's attire and stance without introducing any inaccuracies.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls consistent with the original image's style, avoiding unnatural artifacts and loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Russian nesting dolls are depicted with smooth, cartoon-like textures typical of chibi-style representations. While this differs from the realistic texture in Image A, the dolls effectively maintain an evenness in texture and detail with no unnatural artifacts. Therefore, the style transition from realistic to cartoonish has been applied consistently without any noticeable loss of detail or introduction of artifacts.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are placed on the wooden table with no visible artifacts or unnatural textures where they meet the table. Their bases sit flat against the table surface, suggesting attention to detail in placement and avoiding any unrealistic visual cues. The shadows and edges appear natural, indicating careful integration of the dolls into the scene.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are arranged in a neat horizontal line.
