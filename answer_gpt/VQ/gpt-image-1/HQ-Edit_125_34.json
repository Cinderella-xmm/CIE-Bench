      "question": "Are the brass gears and levers on the desk properly aligned with the desk’s structure, showing no signs of floating, misshapen geometry, or unnatural material seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desk features decorative elements such as brass gears and levers. Upon examining these components, they appear to be well integrated with the desk, showing no floating parts or distorted geometrical shapes. There are also no visible material seams that look out of place, indicating that they are purposely built as part of the desk. The reasoning is based on recognizing the alignment and attachment of objects to surfaces, looking for consistent placement that suggests attachment and craftsmanship.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the modified books display consistent glowing effects without distorting their page edges or causing unnatural light bleeding into surrounding surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, certain books exhibit glowing effects, possibly indicating technology embedded within an antiquated setting. The glowing effects are consistent across the surface of the books without causing distortion to the page edges nor creating any unnatural light bleeding onto adjacent surfaces. Evaluating these characteristics requires spatial awareness and understanding of light behavior—specifically how illumination should behave when confined to the surfaces of intended objects.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the holographic globe above the monitor clearly visible with proper depth and transparency, and does it cast natural shadows or reflections on the desk surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image does not include a holographic globe above a monitor. Instead, Image B showcases a projected image of the world as part of a retro-futuristic setup, likely replacing the monitor shown in Image A. This projection appears to have a suitable level of transparency and depth effect, in alignment with its thematic style. However, due to the stylized and digital nature of the elements, assessing natural shadows or reflections is challenging, yet they contribute visually consistent depth cues.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the newly added ornate frames around the windows seamlessly integrated with the existing window structure, without overlapping glass panes or creating distorted perspective lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show windows with ordinary glass panes as featured in Image A; it depicts an entirely stylistic wall with ornate motifs indicative of an abstract steampunk aesthetic. There aren't physical window structures with panes to assess as one might expect in a conventional setting. Thus, the question of seamless integration of frames relates more to design continuation, not alignment with glass panes.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all edited elements (gears, glowing books, hologram, window frames) share consistent lighting and shadow behavior, avoiding abrupt changes in brightness or material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited elements, including gears, glowing books, and digital projections, seem to maintain a harmonious visual environment with consistent lighting and shadow across these elements. They align well with the warm, soft light palette typical in a steampunk setting. The absence of harsh brightness transitions or erratic material property changes supports the idea that these elements are intended to exist within the same universe, which shows an understanding of how light interacts with various surfaces.",
