      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the crystal shards forming the wings symmetrically aligned and structurally coherent, without visible gaps, misaligned facets, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are composed of crystal-like shards exhibiting symmetry and structured alignment. The visual appeal of such wings relies on precise geometric arrangement and consistent spacing. Observing the shards, they seem evenly spaced and harmonious in their configuration, with no distortions or misalignments, indicating a coherent structure and balance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the golden leafy strands follow the natural flow of the original hair and appear integrated without floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden leaf strands in Image B visually integrate with the hair's natural flow, mimicking the way a crown or hair accessory would sit against the scalp. They appear to be smoothly embedded within the hairstyle, aligning closely with the curves of the hair and avoiding any appearance of levitation or detachment, which enhances their realistic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shirt display a uniform, soft velvet texture with natural shadowing and no repeating patterns or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shirt in Image B has a texture that suggests a soft, velvety material. The texture appears consistent across the surface, with gentle shadowing that enhances the perception of a plush fabric. There are no visible patterns or artifacts that would indicate digital manipulation, suggesting a deliberate effort to maintain textile realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a consistent deep gray wall with no visible edges, lighting anomalies, or remnants of the original scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a deep gray wall, designed to be plain and uniform, providing a neutral backdrop that highlights the subject. This homogenous backdrop shows no visible seams, edges, or variations that distract the eye, maintaining uniformity and avoiding inconsistencies or leftover elements from the editing process.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all edited elements—crystal wings, leafy hair, and velvet shirt—properly aligned with the body and each other, without clipping, overlapping errors, or positional distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the alignment of edited elements with the body is examined for consistency and harmony. The wings are proportionately attached to the back, the golden leaves integrate with the hair without awkward overlaps, and the shirt fits naturally on the shoulders. These elements are visually cohesive, without any observable errors in positioning or clipping that would compromise the overall composition.",
