      "question": "Do the croissants, macarons, and cupcakes retain their natural texture and appearance after being incorporated into the treasure map design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the croissants, macarons, and cupcakes maintain their shape and general appearance but are given an illustrative look to fit the treasure map theme. The edited image adopts a sepia-like tone and smooth textures more akin to a drawing, rather than retaining the realistic texture seen in Image A. Image A shows the desserts in their natural, realistic form with visible textures and color variations. Thus, upon comparison, it is evident the natural textures and appearance are not fully retained in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dotted trail leading to the frosting-shaped 'X' integrated smoothly without causing any unnatural textures or loss of detail on the surrounding desserts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a dotted trail incorporated into the treasure map design. The trail is drawn in a style consistent with the rest of the map, and it winds around the desserts without disrupting their illustrative representation. When comparing it to Image A, where the desserts appear realistic, Image B maintains a coherent design, with no unusual textures caused by the dotted trail. The trail is smoothly integrated into the background.",

      "question": "Do the sugar-coated compass rose and berries appear naturally placed and enhance the dessert-themed journey without looking out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the compass rose and berries are integrated into the design with a consistent illustrative style matching the treasure map theme. The compass rose fits with the adventure theme, and the berries complement the dessert motif without appearing out of place due to their stylized depiction matching the rest of the design. Compared to Image A, where the focus is solely on realistic desserts, Image B successfully incorporates these elements smoothly into the thematic context.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the desserts consistent and realistic within the context of the treasure map, avoiding any distortion or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions and shapes of the desserts are preserved in the illustrative style. Although stylized to fit the treasure map theme, they remain consistent in size and proportion relative to one another. In Image A, the realistic depiction also maintains consistent proportions among the desserts. Thus, the proportions and shapes are consistent between both images, with Image B effectively maintaining realistic scaling within the map context.",

      "question": "Does the weathered parchment background integrate seamlessly with the desserts, preserving their fine details and avoiding any visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a weathered parchment backdrop that fits the treasure map theme. This background complements the illustrative style of the desserts without creating visual artifacts. The fine details of the desserts are stylized to fit within this theme. Image A showcases desserts on a wooden surface, displaying fine textures without a parchment-style background. Both images keep the dessert details intact respective to their themes, and Image B integrates the parchment background without issues.",
