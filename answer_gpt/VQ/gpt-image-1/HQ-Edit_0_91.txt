    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features proportionally consistent with human anatomy, and do they maintain natural contours without exaggerated or distorted lines?",
    "explanation": "The facial features in Image B are intentionally blurred and not directly discernible. Therefore, it is not possible to assess whether they are proportionally consistent with human anatomy or if they maintain natural contours. The blurring prevents any evaluation of distortion or exaggeration of lines.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the gold leaf accents follow the existing pattern flow and appear integrated into the textile without unnatural highlights or floating textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold leaf accents appear to be part of the illustrated design and follow the flow of the floral and geometrical patterns on the robe. The integration seems smooth without unnatural highlights or textures that appear to float above the fabric. The choice of colors and how they are applied makes these accents look naturally incorporated into the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the enlarged hands anatomically accurate with five fingers each, proper joint structure, and natural skin texture without stretching or blurring?",
    "explanation": "The hands in Image B are stylized in keeping with the overall illustrated and artistic design approach of the image. While they are not photorealistic, each hand has five fingers with a reasonable depiction of joint structure. The artistic style does not attempt to blur or stretch the skin texture unnaturally, maintaining visual harmony with the rest of the illustrative approach.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the floral outlines extend naturally from the robe into the indigo border without sudden breaks, inconsistent linework, or misaligned patterns?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the floral patterns extending into the indigo border with clean and continuous linework. The patterns and outlines do not show sudden breaks or alignment issues, indicating careful attention to maintaining visual consistency across the image. This seamless extension suggests a coherent integration of the design elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the textile materials retain visible texture variation and depth, avoiding flatness or pixelation that would suggest degraded quality?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the textile materials are represented through illustration, which means the texture and depth are conveyed through linework and color variations rather than photographic realism. Despite the illustration style, the detail given to the patterns and shades creates a sense of depth without pixelation or flatness, maintaining the quality expected in such an artistic interpretation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
