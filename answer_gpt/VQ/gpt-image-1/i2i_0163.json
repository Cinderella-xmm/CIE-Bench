      "question": "Does the outdoor camping scene seamlessly integrate with the toasters, maintaining consistent lighting and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting on the toasters in Image B is consistent with the outdoor setting. The sunlight casts realistic shadows and highlights, indicating a coherent integration of the toasters in the outdoor environment. The direction and intensity of light on the toasters align with the outdoor scene's lighting, suggesting a seamless blend.",

      "question": "Are the toasters placed naturally on the folding table without any visible distortion in the table's texture or structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters are placed on a folding table without visible distortion. The table's texture and surface look intact, supporting a natural placement. The lines and edges of the table align well with the toasters, indicating a coherent positioning without disturbances.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the sunlight effects on the toast create realistic highlights and shadows on both the toast and surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunlight in Image B casts realistic highlights and shadows on the toast and the toasters, creating believable lighting effects. The toast exhibits consistent lighting relative to the outdoor environment, enhancing the realism of the shadows on the toasters and surrounding objects. These effects align well with the expected behavior of direct sunlight in an outdoor setting.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the outdoor camping background and the foreground elements smooth, without any noticeable artifacts or missing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the outdoor camping background and the foreground elements is smooth. There are no visible artifacts or inconsistencies, and the background complements the foreground elements adequately. The blending appears natural, with coherent depth and perspective, enhancing the realism of the scene.",

      "question": "Have the proportions and shapes of the toasters remained intact and physically plausible in the new outdoor camping scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions and shapes of the toasters have remained intact and are consistent with their physical appearance in an outdoor setting. The toasters appear normal in size and shape, fitting naturally with the surrounding elements on the table, which supports their integration into the scene without any distortion.",
