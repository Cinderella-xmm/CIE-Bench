      "question": "Does the child's coat maintain a coherent shape with natural folds and no distorted or broken seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child's coat is illustrated with clean lines and a uniform yellow coloration, typical of a simple cartoon style often seen in children's books. The design is simplistic, with basic fold indications that are consistent with animated renditions, thus maintaining coherence. There's no noticeable distortion or breakage in the seams.",

      "question": "Are the balloon surfaces evenly colored in pastel tones without visible color bleeding or loss of specular highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balloons are rendered in pastel colors consistent with a watercolor aesthetic, showing soft, evenly applied tones that avoid pronounced highlights typical of glossy finishes. The absence of color bleeding aligns with a clean watercolor style where individual balloon colors stay distinct.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child's right hand is stylized in line with cartoon simplification, featuring a hand that, while not explicitly detailed, suggests five fingers through indicative lines without any obviously missing or extra digits.",

      "question": "Is the watercolor texture applied uniformly across the wheat field without disrupting the visibility of individual stalks or creating unnatural stroke lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a wheat field with a soft watercolor texture that respects the uniformity and visibility typical of a simplified landscape illustration. The texture subtly represents individual stalks without harsh or unnatural stroke transitions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the style and placement of the calendar grid at the bottom follow basic illustrative convention; it appears laid over the ground, but as a calendar page design, rather than casting shadows or appearing three-dimensional, aligning with typical printed material design aesthetics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
