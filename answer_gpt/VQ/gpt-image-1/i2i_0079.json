        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the collectible figure is stylistically designed to match the minimalist, angular shapes of the dresser and the round shapes of the mirror.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportion and physical rationality of the collectible figure design consistent with the surrounding elements on the dresser, ensuring it does not appear distorted or out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a design where the figure is proportionate to the dresser's scale. While the figure itself is stylized, it is intentionally abstract, and does not overshadow nor appear unusual compared to the other items. This indicates the proportions are sensible within the intended design language. Its minimalist form ensures it is consistent with the nearby geometric shapes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collectible figure adopts a matte black color that harmonizes with the dresser's black finish. This ensures there are no discordant colors detracting from the cohesive look. The muted colors of the figure and surrounding objects collectively maintain visual continuity, avoiding glaring contrasts.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a collectible figure with smooth and precise texture work similar to the clean lines of the dresser and mirror, showcasing a refined attention to detail.

      "question": "Does the composition and layout of the collectible figure design on the dresser appear logically placed, enhancing the scene's overall visual credibility without disrupting the existing arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the collectible figure centrally placed, mirroring the placement of the vase next to it on the dresser. This balanced arrangement preserves the overall aesthetic and does not skew the symmetry or flow of the scene. Its planned positioning enhances rather than disrupts the setup, maintaining spatial relevance.",
