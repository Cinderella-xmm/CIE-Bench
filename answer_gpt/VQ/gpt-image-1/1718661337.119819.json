      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the brown leather trench coat have consistent texture and natural folds that align with human body contours, and are the brass gears and mechanical details integrated without disrupting the coat's structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brown leather trench coat displays a rich texture typical of leather, with natural folds and creases that follow the contours of the wearer's body. Brass gears and mechanical details are seamlessly integrated into the coat, enhancing the steampunk aesthetic without compromising the coat's design and structure. This integration is visually balanced and maintains the coat's functionality, suggesting a coherent design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the chronometer held in the right hand proportionally sized relative to the hand, with realistic shadows and reflections, and does it maintain a natural grip without distorted fingers or misplaced joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chronometer held in the right hand appears proportionally sized compared to the hand, with no evident distortions or disproportionate scaling. Shadows and reflections on the chronometer are consistent with a light source and blend naturally with the hand's contours. The grip seems natural, with fingers positioned correctly and no anomalies in joints, ensuring realism in posture and function.",

      "question": "Are the goggles positioned on the tricorne hat in a way that respects the hatâ€™s structure, with no floating parts, unnatural shadows, or clipping errors between the goggles and the hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The goggles perched on the tricorne hat in Image B are integrated seamlessly, respecting the structural integrity of the hat. There are no floating elements or signs of the goggles being unrealistically placed. The shadows cast are natural and align with the light direction, and there are no visible clipping errors, maintaining coherence between the goggles and the hat.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the airships and floating cities in the background appear at appropriate distances, with consistent lighting and atmospheric perspective, and do they not overlap or obscure the subject unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airships and floating cities are rendered at various distances, creating a believable depth with atmospheric perspective. The lighting is consistent across these elements, contributing to the scene's coherence and layering. There is no unnatural overlap or obstruction of the main subject, ensuring a clear and effective composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the leather coat, brass gears, and other materials free from unnatural repetition, blurring, or artificial edges, and do fine details such as stitching and rivets remain sharp and consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a detailed leather coat with a texture that avoids unnatural repetition and maintains sharpness without blurring. Brass gears and other mechanical components are rendered with clean and sharp detailing, like stitching and rivets, remaining consistent throughout. The materials are depicted without artificial edges, supporting the image's overall realism and craftsmanship.",
