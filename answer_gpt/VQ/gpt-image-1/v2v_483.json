      "question": "Does the man's face maintain natural proportions and avoid distortion after being converted into a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's face is transformed into a 3D cartoon style. In such transformations, maintaining natural proportions involves keeping facial features in a balanced manner without exaggeration. Based on visual cues, the face in Image B does not appear to have any anatomical distortion relative to cartoon styles. Using artistic knowledge about 3D character design, the face seems consistent with stylistic attributes typical in caricature art.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and details of the hand holding the fan natural and free from artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the fan has been converted into a cartoon style. Essential qualities such as finger proportions and palm contours that naturally depict a hand are retained without pixelation or unintended distortions, making it appear coherent and effectively stylized. Based on the principles of character styling, the hand looks clear and smooth, fitting well within the cartoon transformation.",

      "question": "Does the fan appear to interact naturally with the environment, without introducing any unnatural artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fan is depicted as part of the 3D cartoon rendition. Despite the stylistic conversion, the fan's structure and its interaction with surrounding elements like smoke from the candle are consistent with typical cartoon renditions. The fan's presence does not cause visual disharmony or exhibit strange distortions within the scene.",

      "question": "Do the birthday cake and its candles retain a natural appearance and avoid obvious artifacts after the style conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluating Image B, the cake and candles are presented in a cartoon style, yet preserve their integral shapes and colors typical for such objects. The candles still appear upright and visually maintain the effect of lit flames, fitting within the cartoon aesthetic without visible anomalies.",

      "question": "Do the balloons and candles in the festive-themed backdrop blend seamlessly into the scene without disrupting the overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balloons and candles are incorporated into a festive cartoon backdrop. The balloons are depicted with rounded contours and vivid colors customary in celebration illustrations. Their inclusion completes the festive theme while the candles follow the same aesthetic integrity, and both elements harmonize with the overall design without apparent breaks in realism or natural appearance for the readerâ€™s artistic perspective.",
