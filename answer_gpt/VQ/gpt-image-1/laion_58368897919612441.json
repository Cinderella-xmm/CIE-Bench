      "question": "Are the two towers and the central wall of the fortress proportionally reduced without distortion or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image features a miniature fortress within a terrarium. The towers and central wall appear to be reduced proportionally and maintain their structural integrity without distortion, suggesting the model's geometry is consistent with the real-world architecture depicted in Image A. There are no visible signs of broken geometry or awkward proportions in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss covering the ground exhibit natural texture and color gradients, resembling real moss rather than a uniform or painted surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moss in Image B exhibits a texture and color gradient that mimic real moss. It is varied in color and texture, indicating an attempt to replicate the natural appearance of moss rather than a flat or uniform paint job. The variation in shades and the dense appearance contribute to its realistic representation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the model knights positioned on the moss at a scale consistent with the miniature fortress, and do they rest fully on the ground without floating or intersecting with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model knights are positioned on the ground, maintaining scale consistency with the miniature castle. They are placed firmly on the moss without appearing to float or intersecting with other elements like pathways or the base. Their positioning and scale are harmonious relative to the fortress model.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the faux stone pathways extend from the fortress base onto the moss with consistent texture and alignment, matching the original stonework without gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pathways in Image B blend consistently from the fortress base onto the moss, maintaining alignment and matching the texture of the original stonework. The pathways are aligned properly, with no visible gaps or misalignment, ensuring a continuity that reflects the original castle design.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the glass star transparent and reflective, positioned precisely at the top of the central tower's spire without overlapping or deforming the underlying structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass star is transparent and has a reflective quality. It is positioned accurately at the top of the central tower's spire without overlapping or causing deformation to the structure beneath. The star's placement is precise, allowing the underlying details to remain intact and undisturbed.",

      "question": "Is the terrarium dome smoothly curved and transparent, enclosing the fortress without visible seams, warping, or optical distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The terrarium dome in Image B is smoothly curved and transparent, ensuring visibility of the fortress without optical distortions, seams, or warping. The enclosure appears intact and clear, preserving the aesthetic presentation of the miniature within.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the wooden stand beneath the terrarium have visible wood grain, weathering, and design details consistent with vintage craftsmanship, and does it securely support the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden stand beneath the terrarium exhibits visible wood grain and design details characteristic of vintage craftsmanship. These details contribute to the authenticity of the model's presentation, and the stand appears to securely support the dome with no indication of instability.",
