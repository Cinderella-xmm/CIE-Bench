        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a chibi style which traditionally includes a larger head proportion relative to the body, smaller limbs, and a simplified details. The keychain design maintains these proportions consistently, with no parts appearing disproportionately large or exaggerated beyond typical chibi standards. This suggests adherence to conventional chibi structure.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character stands firmly on the shell-shaped base with a traditional and stable stance. The feet are positioned logically on the base, suggesting balance and stability consistent with the portrayal of characters in keychain designs. There are no awkward angles or positions at odds with the laws of physics.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is stylized in a manner suitable for a keychain, prioritizing a smooth, coherent design over detailed textures.
