      "question": "Is the entire cityscape and car enclosed within a transparent, geometrically perfect cube with consistent refractive qualities that distort surrounding elements naturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cityscape and car are contained within a transparent cube. The sides of the cube show accurate geometric alignment and consistent refractive properties which cause some distortion, typical of transparent materials. Common understanding of geometric shapes and refraction principles confirms that the cube is geometrically perfect, maintaining the surrounding sceneâ€™s integrity minus the natural distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car's surface exhibit a uniform, high-quality metallic texture with natural reflections and no artifacts like blotches, smudges, or missing specular highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The car in Image B displays a sleek, metallic finish. The reflections on its surface show uniformity, implying high-quality material without noticeable artifacts such as blotches or smudges. The shine and specular highlights appear natural, consistent with a smooth, polished metallic surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers scaled down uniformly and proportionally without geometric distortions such as stretched windows, skewed angles, or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers of the cityscape are depicted as miniaturized scale models. They maintain correct proportions; the windows and building edges are properly aligned without any visible distortions, suggesting that the scaling was done uniformly and meticulously.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the windows of the skyscrapers display small, consistent, and physically plausible light points resembling micro LEDs without haloing, bleeding, or unnatural brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The windows of the skyscrapers in Image B feature small, consistent light points suggesting illumination, akin to micro LEDs. These lights maintain their brightness without bleeding or unnatural halo effects, appearing physically plausible for scaled miniature models.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the trees feature finely detailed, dense green foliage with natural color variation and no pixelation or blocky rendering, indicating proper micro-scale modeling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are shown within the cube, featuring dense, green foliage with subtle color variations, replicating natural appearances accurately. There is no pixelation or blockiness, indicating that the miniature model includes finely detailed foliage.",
