      "question": "Do the ceramic sculptures exhibit a uniform glossy finish with realistic reflections that align with the direction and intensity of the sunset light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceramic sculptures have a glossy finish that reflects light, but the background is not an outdoor setting; rather, it is a studio-like environment with a uniform tan-colored background. Therefore, there are no reflections interacting with an outdoor sunset light, as the setting does not depict such lighting conditions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textured scales evenly distributed across the sculpture surfaces without visible repetition, distortion, or sharp edges suggesting digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ceramic sculptures in Image B have textured scales that appear evenly distributed. The texture looks smooth, with no signs of digital artifacting, distortion, or sharp edges, suggesting a high-quality finish typical of crafted ceramic works.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the deep oceanic blue coloration of the sculptures consistent across all parts and harmonious with the surrounding ocean and sky colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the deep oceanic blue is consistent across all sculptures. However, the background is a plain tan color and not an ocean or sky, making the assumption of harmony with ocean and sky colors inapplicable in this environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly sandy-colored with no visible traces of the original ocean, waves, or shoreline elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is uniformly sandy-colored with no visible ocean, waves, or shoreline elements. It appears to be a plain backdrop typically used in product photography, entirely different from an outdoor setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sculptures arranged in a continuous, flowing wave pattern that matches the curvature and rhythm of the original ocean waves in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculptures are arranged in an artistic, curling pattern reminiscent of waves, but the indoor setting and lack of actual water or waves reduce the direct comparison with ocean scenery. The arrangement is artistic rather than mimicking any specific ocean wave pattern from Image A.",
