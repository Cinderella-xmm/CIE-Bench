    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges of the jigsaw pieces smooth and interlocking without gaps or overlapping deformities?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the jigsaw pieces appear to have well-defined and smooth edges, designed to interlock perfectly with one another. There are no visible gaps or deformities that would suggest overlapping or improper alignment when assembled. This observation is based on the puzzle piecesâ€™ clear-cut boundaries and typical design for jigsaw puzzles, which necessitates uniformity and precision to fit seamlessly.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the dragon patterns appear in darker wood stain and the compass area in lighter wood stain, with no abrupt or unnatural color transitions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon patterns are indeed depicted with a darker wood stain, adding depth and contrast to their curved and intricate designs. The compass area is stained lighter, distinguishing the central design from the surrounding dragons. The transition between these stains is smooth, preserving a natural look without abrupt changes, which aligns with common woodworking and staining techniques to highlight different elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the wood grain texture visible and naturally varied across all puzzle pieces, without repeating patterns or artificial smoothing?",
    "explanation": "The wood grain texture in Image B is visible throughout the puzzle pieces, showing a natural variance typical of real wood. There are no obvious repeating patterns or signs of digital smoothing that would indicate artificial enhancement. This natural variance in texture is consistent with genuine wooden materials, wherein the grain pattern is inherently unique and non-repetitive.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the puzzle pieces arranged in a physically plausible scattered layout on the wooden surface, with no floating or overlapping pieces that defy gravity or perspective?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the puzzle pieces are scattered on the wooden surface in a manner that appears physically possible. They lay flat, adhering to the rules of gravity, and there is no indication of pieces overlapping improperly or floating, which would defy realistic physical behavior and perspective. This type of arrangement reflects an authentic scattered layout one might encounter when working with a puzzle.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the central compass retain its circular shape and fine internal details, with no distortion or loss of precision in the engraved lines and divisions?",
    "explanation": "The central compass in Image B preserves its circular integrity and displays fine details with precision. The engraved lines and divisions are sharp and undistorted, indicating well-maintained craftsmanship in both design and execution. The clarity and accuracy of these features are crucial for the functionality and aesthetic of a compass, which must be meticulously detailed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
