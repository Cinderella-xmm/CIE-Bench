      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features added over the star motif proportionally aligned and integrated without distorting the star’s shape or creating unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of the edited image features a star motif on what is assumed to be the upper chest area of the jersey. Over this motif, facial features like eyes and a mouth have been added. These facial features are stylistically cartoonish and spread across the star emblem. Observing the placement and integration of these features, they seem to fit seamlessly into the star motif without altering its fundamental shape or creating any awkward edges or distortions. The eyes and mouth are proportionally spaced, maintaining the continuity of the motif as part of a larger cohesive design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the motion lines surrounding the character have smooth, consistent strokes that align with the jersey's design language and do not exhibit pixelation or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, motion lines appear around the character as lines suggesting speed or movement. These lines are visually consistent, solid with no visible pixelation or jagged edges, which suggests good integration into the overall composition. The choice of colors and line direction is consistent with the dynamic depiction of a character in motion, matching the graphic style of the jersey’s original design components. The lines maintain thematic unity with the sharp and clean styling of the jersey graphics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all newly added elements (facial features, motion lines, tagline) rendered using only the original jersey’s color scheme (blue, white, red, gray), with no unintended color bleed or mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The newly added elements in the edited image include facial features, motion lines, and a tagline. These elements appear to use the jersey’s existing color palette, which includes blue, white, red, and gray. The facial features (eyes and mouth), the motion lines surrounding the character, and the diagonal tagline all integrate these colors, fitting seamlessly into the visual style of the jersey. There are no signs of color bleeding or mismatch, ensuring the edited portions align with the existing color scheme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tagline \"Ride Like a Star!\" positioned diagonally in the bottom-left corner without overlapping or obscuring existing text or graphics, and is it clearly readable without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the tagline 'Ride Like a Star!' is positioned diagonally across the bottom-left corner, using bold typography for emphasis. The placement is strategic, avoiding overlap with any main elements, existing text, or graphics on the jersey. The text is well-spaced and clearly readable, using substantial lettering to ensure visibility. The orientation may convey a sense of movement without compromising clarity or risking visual interference.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the fabric texture of the jersey, including the repeated \"DALLAS\" pattern and mesh-like sections, remain intact and undistorted even in areas near the added facial features and motion lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image, the jersey retains its fabric texture, evident in the detailed pattern and mesh-like texture seen throughout. Despite the addition of facial features and motion lines, these textures remain coherent. The 'DALLAS' text and repeated meshlike fabric design persist without alteration or distortion, indicating careful integration of new elements without disrupting the original texture patterns.",
