      "question": "Does the brocade doublet on the man have consistent texture, visible pattern details, and natural fabric folds that conform to his body shape without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's brocade doublet is depicted with an intricate pattern and detailed texture. The fabric appears to follow the natural shape of his body smoothly, without any apparent distortions and the folds behave in a physically accurate manner, indicating a realistic representation. Thus, the texture and detail are consistent with what is expected from a high-quality fabric such as brocade.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the flowing skirt of the womanâ€™s gown composed of layered, translucent fabric with natural ruffles and soft gradients, and do the jeweled accents appear embedded rather than pasted on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowing skirt of the woman's gown is depicted with a rich texture that implies layered, translucent fabric. The ruffles appear natural, and there is a gradient that enhances the perception of depth and softness. The jeweled accents on the gown seem to be fully integrated into the fabric, giving the sense of being embedded rather than artificially placed on the surface.",

      "question": "Do the marble floor tiles display continuous veining patterns and subtle reflections, and are the chandeliers structurally sound with clear crystal elements and warm light diffusion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases marble floor tiles with comprehensive veining patterns that mimic natural marble. The tiles exhibit subtle reflections consistent with polished marble surfaces. Additionally, the chandeliers in the image have a visibly robust structure, wherein the crystal elements are depicted with clarity, and the diffusion of warm light looks natural and uniform across the scene.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast by the dancers appear soft and maintain a consistent directionality with the overhead chandeliers, indicating a realistic light source.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancers' hands appear anatomically correct with each hand displaying five fingers. The joint alignment is natural, and the skin texture looks smooth. There are no overlapping or missing fingers where they make contact, suggesting a precise attention to anatomical detail.",
