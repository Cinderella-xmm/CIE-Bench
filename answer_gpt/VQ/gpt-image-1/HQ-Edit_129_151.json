    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the elder’s face show natural skin texture, realistic wrinkles, and facial proportions without distortion or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elder’s face is intentionally blurred, making it impossible to discern details related to the skin texture, wrinkles, or facial proportions. To assess the realism of these features, we would need clarity, which the image does not provide due to the editing.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree trunks and branches in the background structurally coherent, with natural bark texture and no broken or warped shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the background with stylized illustrations, resembling a woodcut or printmaking style, which differs from realistic textures. The tree shapes are preserved but simplified and have uniform patterns consistent with such artistic depictions. This stylization causes a departure from the natural, detailed texture in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the water surface reflect the surrounding trees and sky accurately, with smooth gradients and no distorted or duplicated elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface is part of a stylized background typical of illustrations with limited shading and detail, differing from Image A's realistic aquatic reflection. The simple color gradients and patterns do not represent accurate reflections, highlighting the artistic adaptation over precise nature depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the duck-shaped chess pieces positioned correctly on the chessboard squares without overlapping, floating, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chess pieces rendered in an illustrative style, each occupying distinct squares on the board. The positioning is clear, with no evidence of overlapping or misalignment. The stylized depiction is coherent with the board's grid.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the calligraphy text placed in the lower right corner without overlapping key elements, and does it have clean lines and natural ink-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calligraphy text is positioned at the lower right without visibly overlapping key image elements, providing clean separation from other parts of the illustration. The lines are crisp, and the stylized texture imitates traditional ink calligraphy effectively.",
