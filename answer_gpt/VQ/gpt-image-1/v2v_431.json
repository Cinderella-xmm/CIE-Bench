      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the keys preserved without distortion after being converted into 3D cartoon-style chibi renditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keys are rendered with a consistent 3D cartoon-style, converting naturalistic shapes into more stylized versions. The geometric integrity of the shapes, such as the pentagram, triangle, and other elements, appears maintained without observable distortion. When compared to Image A, the design of the keys remains the same despite the styling change, indicating a preservation of their geometric forms. This reflects a conscious effort to retain the original design elements while applying the cartoon style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the red and gold hues used on the keys appear natural and consistent with the Chinese festive theme without introducing unnatural color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses red and gold hues which are traditional colors associated with Chinese festivities, conveying prosperity and good fortune. These colors appear evenly applied across the keys, maintaining consistency with the intended theme. The hue transition is smooth, without any patchy or unnatural appearances. This indicates an adherence to a coherent color palette suitable for the thematic representation.",

      "question": "Does the texture of the keys resemble polished, ornamental accessories without introducing unnatural artifacts or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keys are depicted with a smooth, polished texture consistent with ornamental accessories. The shading and highlights support this look, reflecting a glossy surface. Compared to Image A, where the keys have a more metallic and rustic texture, the edited version simplifies the texture for a stylized effect without losing essential design details, ensuring the keys still look ornamental and elegant.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the \"囍\" paper-cut design in the background complement the keys without disrupting the visual credibility or introducing distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features the '囍' symbol, common in Chinese culture, especially in weddings for double happiness. It is subtly integrated, with the hue matching the festive theme, complementing rather than overshadowing the keys. This design decision adds context and thematic depth without creating visual clutter, maintaining a harmonious appearance and credibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions and sizes of the keys in the 3D cartoon-style chibi rendition realistic and coherent, avoiding any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keys are rendered in a cartoon-style, which inherently involves exaggeration and simplification, yet they maintain proportionate relationships between their components. This stylistic choice should align with the aesthetic norms of cartoon renditions which often prioritize expressiveness. The transition from the realistic proportions in Image A to the stylized versions in Image B retains coherence across the design, avoiding disproportionate distortions.",
