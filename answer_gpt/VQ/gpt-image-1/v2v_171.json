      "question": "Does the chibi Funko Pop-style figure maintain the structural coherence of the child's facial features without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure adopts the chibi or Funko Pop style, which is characterized by exaggerated head-to-body proportions, often featuring a larger head and minimal facial details. This style inherently distorts typical human facial proportions for aesthetic purposes. Since this design choice aligns with common practices for chibi figures, it doesnâ€™t fall under 'unnatural distortions' as per the aesthetic standards of the Funko Pop style.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the figure is depicted with headphones and a tablet, elements that are commonly seen in such thematic toys. The textures of these accessories appear consistent with the rest of the figure.

      "question": "Does the casual attire of the chibi figure retain its realistic texture and detail, avoiding any loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figure's attire in the edited image appears simplistic, in line with the typical Funko Pop aesthetic. The texture is smooth, reflecting the usual toy material look, with sufficient detail for the toy style intended. Although not as detailed as an actual fabric, this representation is realistic within the context of the toy design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cross-legged sitting pose of the chibi figure with the tablet anatomically plausible and free of any unnatural deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pose of the figure is consistent with cartoonish designs where realism is not as emphasized as stylization and cuteness. The cross-legged sitting position is commonly depicted in a simplified manner in chibi figures, maintaining a coherent look acceptable within the stylized art form, showing no unnatural deformation when considering the genre norms.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure outside the packaging in the edited image is shown with appropriate lighting and shading that highlight its 3D property. The textures appear smooth, reflecting a typical vinyl toy surface, with accurate light reflections enhancing its visual plausibility as a product. This aligns with high-quality product visualizations seen in marketing materials for collectibles.",
