    "Question": "Q1: Do the tessellated tiles forming the sausages maintain the original elongated, curved shape without geometric distortion or unnatural straightening?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages are formed using tessellated tiles that follow an elongated and slightly curved form, similar to the original sausages in Image A. The tiling technique maintains the natural curve, avoiding straight lines that could distort the shape. Therefore, the mosaic's representation of the sausages accurately reflects the original shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the green-tiled areas shaped to mimic the natural ruffled edges and layered structure of lettuce leaves, with no uniform or blocky alignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the green tiled areas representing lettuce are irregularly shaped, mimicking the natural ruffled texture and layering of lettuce leaves, similar to Image A. This pattern successfully avoids uniformity, capturing the organic appearance of lettuce.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the egg-shaped tile formation perfectly circular with a centrally placed orange-yellow yolk section, matching the original egg’s proportions and orientation?",
    "explanation": "The egg in Image B is constructed using tiles forming a large circular shape with a distinct orange-yellow center to represent the yolk. This configuration mirrors the proportions and orientation of the egg in Image A, where the yolk is also centrally located. The consistent circularity maintains the original shape's integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the mosaic elements positioned symmetrically around the plate’s center, with equal spacing and proportional sizing between the sausage, salad, and egg sections?",
    "explanation": "The mosaic in Image B does not exhibit perfect symmetry or equidistant spacing between the elements on the plate. The arrangement does not maintain strict symmetrical balance as seen in typical plate layouts. Comparing to the original Image A, the mosaic is styled rather than symmetrically designed.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Do all glass tiles exhibit uniform edge definition, subtle reflection effects, and consistent color shading without visible artifacts like blurring or jagged lines?",
    "explanation": "The glass tiles in Image B have well-defined edges, each tile showcasing uniform color without visible signs of blurring or jaggedness. The consistent shading and subtle reflections across the tiles reflect a high-quality mosaic construction without visual artifacts, enhancing the image's overall aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
