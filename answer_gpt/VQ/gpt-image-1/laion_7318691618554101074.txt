    "Question": "Q1: Do the crystal wands have smooth, continuous surfaces with consistent refraction and no visible digital artifacts or irregularities in shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal wands appear to have smooth, continuous surfaces consistent with natural crystal formations. They have a glossy finish and reflect light evenly, suggesting a lack of visible digital artifacts or irregularities. The facets of the crystals are well-defined and consistent, which indicates proper refractions and an absence of digital imprecision.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the etched floral patterns on the crystal vase evenly distributed, continuous, and visually integrated into the surface without breaking lines or inconsistent shading?",
    "explanation": "The etched floral patterns on the crystal vase in Image B appear to be evenly distributed and finely detailed. The integration into the surface looks seamless without any visible breaks or inconsistencies in shading, suggesting they were properly designed and executed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the carved crystal ribbon fully formed with intact floral motifs and no visible breaks, overlaps, or flattened areas that suggest a 2D-to-3D conversion error?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the carved crystal ribbon looks fully formed, with intact floral motifs that exhibit no visible breaks or overlaps. The details are clear and three-dimensional, avoiding any appearance of 2D-to-3D conversion errors, maintaining an authentic and refined crystal carving aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the reflection on the mirrored surface show a clear, undistorted image of the crystal vase and its contents, with proper symmetry and matching lighting?",
    "explanation": "The reflection on the mirrored surface beneath the crystal vase in Image B is sharp and appears clear without distortion. The symmetry aligns well with the position of the vase and its contents, maintaining coherence with the lighting and spatial arrangement of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the pearls uniformly sized, evenly spaced, and free from warping or blurring that suggests compression or incorrect rendering due to the crystal vase?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not contain pearls as a part of its content. Therefore, there are no issues regarding warping, blurring, or compression regarding pearls in this image.",
    "answer": "No"
