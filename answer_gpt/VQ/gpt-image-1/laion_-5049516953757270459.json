      "question": "Does the LEGO representation of the avocado half retain a smooth, curved appearance with consistent brick alignment along its edge, avoiding jagged or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO representation uses blocky bricks that are inherently angular and cannot perfectly replicate smooth, curved organic shapes. The avocado half, while recognizable, does not have a perfectly smooth edge due to the nature of LEGO bricks. They will inherently have some jaggedness when attempting to create curves. Therefore, the alignment of bricks cannot create a flawlessly smooth curve.",

      "question": "Are the blueberries and raspberries represented with uniformly sized round LEGO bricks that maintain their individual spherical form without flattening or merging into irregular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blueberries and raspberries are constructed using LEGO bricks, which typically include round, single studs that best replicate small spherical shapes. The image shows distinct protrusions representing each berry, maintaining their individual forms without flattening or merging due to the use of separate, singular round bricks.",

      "question": "Does the LEGO broccoli maintain a layered, tree-like branching structure with distinct florets, avoiding overly simplified or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli is depicted using LEGO bricks, which offer a simplified and blocky interpretation. Although the general shape and positioning suggest broccoli, it lacks the detailed layer and tree-like branching structure found in real broccoli. The geometry is quite simplified and does not depict distinct florets in the complex, realistic way that real broccoli does.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is the surface of the LEGO red bell pepper smoothly curved with tightly fitted bricks, showing no visible gaps or abrupt angular transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO red bell pepper in Image B is made using multiple bricks. Due to the nature of LEGO components, which are inherently rectilinear, perfectly smooth curves cannot be achieved. While efforts might have been made to create the illusion of a curve with smaller bricks, there are likely some visible seams and angular transitions. Thus, itâ€™s not smoothly curved in appearance.",

      "question": "Does the outer edge of the LEGO heart-shaped board follow the exact contour of the original wooden board without deviations, breaks, or irregularities in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO heart-shaped board composed of rectangular and angular pieces, resulting in a shape that can mimic but not exactly replicate the continuous curves of the wooden heart in Image A. While the overall shape is recognizable as a heart, LEGO's brick-based construction inherently causes some deviations or irregularities compared to the smoother wooden board.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Are the LEGO asparagus stalks aligned in parallel and bound together by a LEGO representation of twine, preserving the original bundle's structure and proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the asparagus stalks are depicted using rectangular green LEGO pieces, represented in a parallel formation. A yellow brick simulates the twine. This configuration imitates the bundling of real asparagus. While the rectangular nature of the bricks cannot capture the precise proportions of actual asparagus, they effectively replicate the aligned bundle structure.",

      "question": "Is the LEGO heart-shaped board placed on a uniform gray base with no visible shadows, highlights, or texture inconsistencies that suggest mismatched lighting or depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heart-shaped LEGO board sits on a classic LEGO baseplate that is uniformly gray. The evenly studded surface indicates uniformity with no individual brick casting different shadows, nor are there visible highlights or texture inconsistencies. The lighting appears consistent across the gray base.",
