      "question": "Is the typewriter’s keyboard area preserved with correct key layout and spacing, and does the body maintain a coherent rectangular form without warped edges or missing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter's keyboard is visually checked for correct key layout and spacing. It appears normal with symmetric alignment, and the keys have the traditional round shape generally seen in historical typewriters. The body of the typewriter maintains a coherent rectangular form, with no visible warping or missing parts. Although the color in Image B is altered with a sepia tone, the form and structure appear intact and accurate.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text \"Tales Untold\" positioned above the keyboard area without covering any functional parts of the typewriter, and does it follow a horizontal baseline consistent with the notebook’s orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Tales Untold' is situated near the top of the typewriter, clearly separated from the keyboard area, ensuring it does not overlap or obscure any functional parts of the typewriter. The typography is consistently aligned following a horizontal baseline, which is visually parallel to the rest of the notebook's orientation. This placement is strategic so that the main image and the title text are clearly visible and aesthetically balanced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ink splatters scattered irregularly across the surface, with varying sizes and soft edges, and do they not obscure important structural elements like the keys or paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts ink splatters scattered across the surface with an irregular pattern. The splatters vary in size and have soft edges, which gives an aged and artistic appearance to the cover. Importantly, the splatters do not cover significant elements like the keys or paper of the typewriter. They are strategically placed, adding to the vintage aesthetic without interfering with any structural parts of the depicted typewriter.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the marbled background continue evenly under the entire base of the notebook cover, with no visible gaps, clipping, or abrupt color shifts at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the notebook’s cover has a marbled background that extends across the entire surface. There are no abrupt gaps or color shifts on the visible edges, which suggest a seamless surface treatment. This design choice maintains a continuous aesthetic, enhancing the overall visual harmony of the notebook cover as a complete piece.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the leather spine show a consistent texture with slight color variation, and are the embossed key icons evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and shaded to suggest depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, the leather spine of the notebook displays a consistent textured appearance, with slight color variation that contributes to an authentic leather look. The embossed key icons on the spine are evenly spaced and correctly shaped, exhibiting shading that adds a three-dimensional depth, indicating they are tactile features rather than merely printed designs.",
