    "Question": "Q1: Are the curls in the hair rendered with consistent marble texture, showing natural variations in depth and surface detail without visible artifacts such as blurring, flattening, or inconsistent shading?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the curls in the hair are sculpted in marble or a stone-like texture that shows natural detailing and depth variations. Each curl appears well-defined, maintaining consistent marble characteristics throughout. The image does not show signs of blurring or inconsistent shading that would detract from its stone-like quality. The marble texture is seamlessly applied across the curls, giving a cohesive appearance to the hair.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the ornamental carvings on the neck and shoulders maintain anatomical alignment with the musculature and have continuous, coherent shapes without gaps, misaligned edges, or geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental carvings on the neck and shoulders appear to be intricately designed to fit the musculature of the figure. These carvings flow naturally with the body's contours, enhancing the anatomy without gaps or disruptions. The details are smooth and display a mastery of alignment, ensuring they work coherently with the curvature and form of the musculature, avoiding any misaligned edges or geometric distortions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the angelic figures in the background depicted with clear outlines, proper proportions, and consistent depth relative to the central figure, without appearing flat, distorted, or fragmented?",
    "explanation": "Image B features angelic figures as integral parts of the background artwork. These figures are well-defined with clear outlines that demonstrate proportion and depth. The depiction includes suitable artistic depth relative to the central figure, contributing to a harmonious composition. There are no signs of flatness or distortion that might fragment the background elements, ensuring the depth and cohesion are maintained throughout the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the entire image uniformly rendered in a monochrome palette with smooth gradients and no abrupt transitions between light and dark areas that suggest incomplete color conversion or artifacting?",
    "explanation": "The image is clearly rendered in a monochrome palette, where smooth gradients are observed. The transition between different light and dark areas is seamless, avoiding any abrupt changes that might indicate incomplete color conversion or artifacting. The monochrome finish provides a consistent aesthetic appeal, with the gradients effectively mimicking the subtleties of shading in a carved marble piece.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do both hands display exactly five fingers each with natural joint articulation and realistic proportions, without fused digits, elongated limbs, or unnatural bending?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both hands do indeed show five fingers each. The articulation of the joints is crafted to resemble realistic human hand anatomy. The proportions are well-considered, avoiding any structural issues like fused digits, elongated limbs, or unnatural bending. The fingers are shaped naturally and positioned to maintain a realistic representation consistent with the overall anatomical prowess of the sculpture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
