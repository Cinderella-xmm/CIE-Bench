      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the hands enlarged but still anatomically correct with five fingers, natural joint positions, and no distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are illustrated in a stylized manner typical of drawings, which may appear larger than in an anatomically precise representation. The fingers and joints, however, maintain a semblance of natural structure, showing five fingers with approximate joint positions. Cartoon or stylized representation often exaggerates features for artistic effect while maintaining recognizable anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the green tones in the tea field vibrant yet consistent with natural plant colors, showing smooth gradients without abrupt shifts or artificial-looking patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green tones in the tea field are vivid and stylized, reflecting artistic interpretation rather than realistic depiction. The gradients are smooth, aligning with the representational style often adopted in illustrations, where colors can be more intense yet maintain a visually appealing and consistent palette.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the gold foil effect on the sack’s logo appear as a smooth, reflective metallic layer without jagged edges, unnatural glare, or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a simplified, stylized approach to the depiction of the sack’s logo, without an attempt at creating a gold foil effect. The illustration uses flat colors for design motifs, characteristic of drawn visuals where realistic effects like reflective metallic layers are not typically rendered.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the vine-patterned borders present along the edges of the image, following natural leaf and stem structures without overlapping or clipping into the main scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, vine-patterned borders are indeed present along the edges. They conform to the structure of natural leaves and stems, staying distinct from the main action scene without noticeable overlapping or intrusion, in line with the careful composition characteristic of framed illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the recycled paper texture applied uniformly across the entire image without obscuring fine details such as the worker’s hair, clothing folds, or tea leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a consistent texture akin to recycled paper, applied as a background or substrate upon which the illustration is set. This texture doesn’t obscure significant details in the drawing, including the stylized renditions of the worker’s hair and clothing or the leaves, allowing such elements to be clearly visible.",
