      "question": "Does the person appear naturally integrated into the scene without any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person stands near the zebra, seemingly engaging with it. Visual cues such as the lighting, shadows, and texture are consistent with the scene, indicating no obvious artifacts. The light source, clothing color, and the shadow beneath him harmonize with the surroundings, suggesting natural integration. Therefore, the person appears normally integrated into the scene.",

      "question": "Is the zebra's head turned in a way that looks natural and plausible for a startled reaction?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, the zebra's head is turned towards the person with an open mouth and wide eyes, which are common indicators of a startled reaction in animals. This position and expression logically fit a situation where the zebra is startled or feels threatened by the nearby human presence.",

      "question": "Are the zebra's stripes clear and detailed without any unnatural blurring or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are consistently sharp, detailed, and clear, maintaining their natural contrast against its body. There is no evident distortion or unusual blurring affecting the stripes, suggesting they are well-integrated into the image and appear natural.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the person's foot look like it is realistically pressing down on the zebra's tail without breaking geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person stands close to the zebra, but his foot does not press down on the zebra's tail. Instead, the zebra is standing with its tail free, moving slightly to the side in a natural manner. There is no interaction where the geometric shape of the tail is altered by the person's foot.",

      "question": "Does the addition of the person maintain the overall composition and layout of the scene without disrupting the natural setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B successfully integrates a person into the scene without disturbing the natural setting. The layout is maintained as the person fits into the existing environment. The composition remains balanced, with the zebra and the person facing each other along the water edge continuing the axis created by background elements, such as rocks, and sand maintaining the overall environmental tone.",
