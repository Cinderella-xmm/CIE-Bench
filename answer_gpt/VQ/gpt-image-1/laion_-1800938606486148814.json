    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transparent upper material appear smooth and uniform without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent opacity across the shoe's surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a shoe with a futuristic design where the upper material appears to have an integrated digital or holographic pattern. The visual cues suggest a smooth and uniform appearance without any pixelation or jagged edges across the surface, indicating high-quality rendering consistent with advanced CGI. There are no visible inconsistencies in opacity, which supports the notion of uniform visual quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the neon blue glow around the Swoosh evenly distributed with smooth transitions and no abrupt color shifts or light leaks into neighboring surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neon blue glow around the Nike Swoosh appears to be smoothly distributed, contributing to an evenly bright and uniform look. Visual analysis indicates that the glow transitions softly without abrupt color shifts or light leaks into the black surface of the shoe, which suggests precise digital effects typically found in professional graphic design or CGI.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the digital screen on the strap properly aligned with the strapâ€™s curvature, showing clear and stable animation content without pixelation or visual noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital screen on the strap appears to integrate seamlessly with the curvature of the strap. The visual content displayed remains clear and stable, with no signs of pixelation or visual noise, which affirms a high-quality digital rendering. This clarity suggests careful synchronization of the digital elements with the physical form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the digital shoe box exhibit consistent geometry and metallic reflection patterns without warped edges or misaligned holographic layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shoe box featured alongside the shoe exhibits consistent geometric lines and shapes indicative of a structured design. The metallic reflection patterns appear regular and symmetrical without any warped edges or misalignments, reflecting a cohesive holographic effect. This suggests high fidelity in 3D modeling and rendering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the shoe box evenly spaced and aligned with the surface contours, without repeating anomalies or misregistration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The geometric patterns on the shoe box are evenly spaced and follow the contours of the surface, as visible in the image. There are no repeating anomalies or misregistration observed, which indicate a precise alignment typically achieved in expert digital design and rendering.",
