      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rose-shaped cap exhibits a realistic metallic texture with appropriate specular highlights, demonstrating understanding of light interaction with a metallic surface. The highlights and shadows suggest a light source coming from above and slightly to the right, adding depth without making it appear overly shiny or flat.",
