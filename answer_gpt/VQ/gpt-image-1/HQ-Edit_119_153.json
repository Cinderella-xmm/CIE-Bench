      "question": "Does the crystal cloche have smooth, continuous curvature with natural light refraction and no visible seams or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass cloche in Image B appears to have a smooth, continuous curvature, indicative of a well-crafted glass dome. The natural light refraction on the surface of the cloche shows realistic behavior, suggesting no visible seams or jagged edges. The highlights on the glass are consistent with how light should interact with a rounded transparent object.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sapphire-colored shingles uniformly textured and do the gold details follow the roofâ€™s architectural contours without appearing artificially painted or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sapphire-colored shingles in Image B demonstrate a uniform texture and the gold details align with the architectural contours of the castle roof, enhancing realism. There is no indication of artificial painting or detachment from the shingles, which signifies a coherent design aesthetic commonly seen in such settings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the flower beds at the entrance have natural plant textures, correct scale relative to the birdhouse, and sit flush with the ground surface without floating or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flower beds at the entrance of the miniature castle show natural plant textures and seem to be to scale with the overall size of the castle model. They sit flush with the ground surface, without signs of floating or clipping, which is crucial for maintaining a realistic miniature scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the woodland creatures visible only through the window openings, positioned behind glass, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with the ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woodland creatures in Image B seem visible through the windows and appear to be positioned behind glass. The behavior of light and shadows on these creatures aligns with the ambient light, ensuring they are placed within the expected scale and perspective of a miniature castle setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the grassy mound have natural undulations, consistent grass coverage, and a seamless transition to the birdhouse base without gaps or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the grassy mound has natural undulations and a consistent grass texture covering the surface. The transition of this grass mound to the base of the castle is seamless, with no visible gaps or floating sections, enhancing the authenticity of the model's setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do all added elements (cloche, flowers, creatures, mound) respond to light consistently with the same direction and intensity as the original birdhouse and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all added elements such as the cloche, flowers, creatures, and grassy mound appear to respond to light consistently with the direction and intensity. This consistency with the pre-existing elements like the birdhouse and background is evident from the uniform shadow casting and light interaction throughout the scene.",
