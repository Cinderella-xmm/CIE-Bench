        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe depicted has abstract geometric patterns that appear to be neatly integrated into the fabric. The patterns do not show any visible texture mismatches, and the edges of the shapes are smooth, without jagged edges. The colors blend seamlessly with the rest of the fabric, providing a cohesive appearance. This suggests a high-quality integration of the pattern into the robe.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's bookcase does not have visible script elements embedded directly within the bookcase surface that could affect visibility or layering. The books remain visible and unobscured, and there are no layering effects that disrupt the continuity of the bookcase.",
