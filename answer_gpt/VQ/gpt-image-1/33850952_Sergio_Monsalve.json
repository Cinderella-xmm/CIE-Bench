    {

      "question": "Are the tentacle-like extensions smoothly integrated into the original curves of the facade without sudden angular breaks or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tentacle-like extensions are observed to seamlessly follow and augment the original curvature of the facade. The smooth integration indicates that these tentacles are in harmony with the existing architectural lines, as there are no visual cues of awkward joins or angular breaks. The design aesthetic appears to prioritize fluid, organic continuation over rigid segmentation, which aligns with the appearance of the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the fibrous textures follow the curvature of the facade and appear continuous without repeating patterns or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fibrous textures are integrated into the facade, and upon inspection, they seem to curve along with the structure in a natural way. These textures do not exhibit visible signs of repeating patterns or jagged edges, suggesting an intention to maintain a consistent and smooth transition through the entirety of the surface. This continuity is indicative of a deliberate design that aligns with the building's flow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the window areas replaced with translucent membranes that maintain soft light transmission and lack sharp borders or visible seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window areas appear to have been transformed into a more organic structure, resembling translucent membranes. These membranes softly diffuse light, as there are no apparent harsh lines or seams that suggest inconsistency or artificiality. This gives the surface a natural and softly illuminated appearance, consistent with how bioluminescent organisms diffuse light.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the iridescent scale patterns align with the surface curvature and display smooth color transitions without flat or distorted regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The iridescent scale patterns on Image B align very well with the surface curvature of the structure. The color transitions exercise smooth gradations, which help maintain the three-dimensionality of the surface without displaying any flat regions or optical distortions. This suggests they have been designed to enhance the natural flow and continuity of the structure's shape.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bio-luminescent lines emit a soft, uneven glow that fades naturally at the edges and interacts with nearby surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bio-luminescent lines are visually present and emit a glow that appears soft and uneven, suggesting a more natural bio-luminescent effect rather than a harsh artificial light. The glow appears to fade as it approaches its edges, subtly interacting with the surface contours, which enhances the organic appearance of the design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all modified elements—tentacles, membranes, textures, and glow lines—properly anchored to the building structure without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A thorough examination of Image B shows that the modified elements like tentacles, fibrous textures, and glow lines are anchored well to the underlying building structure. There are no indications of floating or improperly overlapping parts, as each element integrates neatly into the design, maintaining a stable and cohesive connection throughout.",

      "question": "Are balcony railings, interior furniture, and planters still visible and undistorted beneath the added textures and lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, elements such as balcony railings, interior furniture, and planters are not visible. The transformation appears to have obscured these features beneath the organic textures and lighting effects, indicating that these elements might have been entirely concealed or removed. The focus is on enhancing the exterior organic and surrealistic aesthetic rather than retaining the depiction of interior elements.",
