      "question": "Does the chibi knight maintain consistent metallic texture across the armor, with no visible warping or unnatural smoothing of surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a chibi knight within a decorative dome. The metallic armor shows consistent texture typical of shiny and smooth metal, seen in animated or stylized representations, without any visible warping or features that appear unnaturally smoothed across the various surfaces, which includes the helmet, shield, and body armor components. This consistency aligns with the common depiction of knights in stylized or cartoonish forms.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass dome visually coherent, with clear edges and realistic light refraction, and does it enclose all elements without intersecting or clipping through them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B shows clear, coherent edges and realistic light refraction, suggesting plausible glass effects that reflect light naturally. The dome encloses all elements inside it - including the knight, castle, dragon, and sheep - without any intersection or clipping issues. The visual effect is typical of encapsulated figures within a display or snow globe, where all elements are correctly positioned within the confines.",

      "question": "Does the shield retain its embossed lion design and metallic sheen, with no visible loss of fine detail or unnatural flatness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shield in Image B maintains its metallic sheen and features an embossed lion design. The detailing of the lion is preserved, showing dimensional relief and consistent metallic texture that avoids flatness. The effect is typical of stylized objects that maintain detail in embossed designs, showing depth and texture, consistent with artistic depictions of shields.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sheep proportionally small compared to the knight, with natural wool texture and anatomically correct forms, and are they positioned on the ground without floating or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep appear proportionate in size compared to the chibi knight, reflecting the expected scaling in miniature or stylized displays. The wool texture is discernible, contributing to their natural appearance, and they possess anatomically plausible forms for stylized figures of sheep, positioned firmly on the ground without any evidence of floating or clipping through the surface.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dragonâ€™s body form a continuous, non-intersecting curve around the turret, with consistent scaly texture and no visible gaps or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon figure in Image B appears to be situated near the turret, maintaining a consistent scaly texture with no visible gaps or signs of deformation. Its body is depicted as a continuous curve that avoids intersecting or conflicting with the adjacent turret, forming a harmonious arrangement common in decorative scenes where multiple figures are displayed together.",
