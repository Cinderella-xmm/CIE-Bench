      "question": "Do the muscles and body proportions of the basketball player appear exaggerated but still maintain anatomical plausibility without unnatural bulges or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player has a cartoonish and stylized appearance, characterized by exaggerated muscular features that are typical in illustrations tailored to emphasize certain aspects of characters, like strength or agility. The art style aims for a dramatic effect, often using oversized limbs and defined muscle features. However, despite the exaggeration, the proportions remain recognizable and plausible within this artistic context as they reflect a coherent interpretation of the human form, without any obvious unnatural bulges or geometry that would break anatomical feasibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors applied to the player's clothing and skin consistent with the graffiti theme and do they retain visible texture and material properties without appearing flat or artificially oversaturated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a vibrant, colorful design that aligns with the graffiti aesthetic. The player's clothing and skin colors are bold and saturated but fit well within the overall theme of street art which often employs such vivid use of color for emphasis. There's consistency in color usage that suggests continuity with the backdrop, and while the image leans into a flat illustration style, it doesn’t signify a lack of artistic depth. In this artistic style, oversaturation is part of the expressive approach rather than an artifact, so it doesn't appear artificially misplaced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the basketball have exactly five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and does it grip the ball in a physically credible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, being a stylized, cartoon-like representation, the design doesn't provide realistic anatomical details like individual finger definition. Often in cartoon depictions, details like fingers may be implied or stylized instead of being explicitly rendered, focusing more on capturing the essence of a pose rather than strict anatomical accuracy. The essential grip and pose are communicated, but given the art style, precise, separate fingers aren’t individually visible or counted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blank graffiti-style text area clearly visible, stylistically consistent with the background graffiti, and placed in a way that does not distort the scene or obscure key elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background design with colorful, dynamic graffiti-like patterns that are a crucial thematic element. The blank area on the right card shows a graffiti style consistent with the rest of the background. It complements the graffiti's overall lively and bold design, supporting the scene's unified aesthetic. The placement and integration into the scene ensure it doesn't overpower or obfuscate any critical elements, maintaining visual coherence without distorting the main subject's view.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the lighting, shadows, and surface textures of the player, basketball, and court consistent with each other and free from artifacts such as mismatched highlights or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic design doesn't focus on realistic lighting or shadows, given its illustrative nature. The player's representation lacks realistic textures and shadows, typical of stylized art, which uses flat coloring techniques with strategic highlights for depth. Consistency in shadow or surface textures is not present or necessary, rather the emphasis is on expressive, uniform application of color without concern for realistic effects. Thus, the question of mismatched highlights doesn't apply as the artistic intent circumvents realistic rendering.",
