      "question": "Are the mosaic tiles uniformly distributed across the entire surface of both teddy bears, maintaining consistent size and alignment without visible gaps or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic tiles covering the teddy bears are consistent in size and appear evenly aligned across their surfaces. There are no visible gaps or misaligned edges, indicating that the tiles were applied with a high degree of precision. My observation is based on the regular patterns and absence of any noticeable inconsistencies that could disrupt the uniform distribution of tiles over the bears.",

      "question": "Do the yellow and turquoise tile patterns on the sweaters follow the original shape and contours of the garments without warping or breaking geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the tile patterns on the sweaters are yellow and turquoise and appear to follow the natural contours and shapes of the teddy bears' garments. The colors and geometric shapes of the tiles remain intact and do not show any signs of warping or distortion. This adherence to the original garment shape is evident from the seamless flow and alignment of the tiles along the sweater's surface.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) clearly defined and proportionally correct using shaded tiles, without blurring or misalignment that compromises recognition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the teddy bears, including the eyes, nose, and mouth, are constructed with shaded tiles that are clearly defined and proportionally correct. The features are distinct and recognizable, with no blurring or misalignment that would interfere with their clarity. The use of tiles in varying shades enhances the definition and visibility of each feature, ensuring precision.",

      "question": "Do the bows retain their original shape and appear with a smooth, reflective surface that contrasts naturally with the surrounding mosaic fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bows on the teddy bears are depicted with a smooth, shiny surface that stands out against the mosaic fur, indicating a contrast in texture. The bows maintain their original shape, as seen in the distinct outline and highlights on their surface, which help enhance their three-dimensional appearance. This contrast and shape retention showcases the editing skill used to differentiate the bows from the surrounding tiled fur.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the white pedestal fully grounded beneath the bears, with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does it maintain clean edges and uniform color without blending issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white pedestal in Image B is fully grounded with the bears sitting securely on it. There are no visible gaps or floating effects between the bears and the pedestal. Additionally, the pedestal maintains clean, sharply defined edges and a uniform white color, free from any blending issues or color inconsistencies, suggesting a well-executed integration of the bears onto the pedestal.",
