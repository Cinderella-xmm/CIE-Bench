    "Question": "Q1: Does the metallic armor on the skater's torso and limbs maintain anatomical proportions and avoid unnatural bends or stretched shapes?",
    "explanation": "The metallic armor in Image B shows a streamlined design that aligns with the human anatomy, ensuring natural movement for the skater. The proportions are consistent with what would be expected on a human figure, with no evidence of unnatural bends or distortions. The rounded and articulated joints suggest a design consideration for flexibility and biomechanical efficiency, reflecting an understanding of how armor integrates with motion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the hoverboardâ€™s transparent deck visually consistent in shape and structure, with no broken edges or misplaced glow effects that suggest digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The hoverboard in Image B presents a coherent structure with a glowing effect that is evenly distributed along its length, creating a futuristic impression. The edges appear smooth and continuous, with the glow complementing the intended high-tech design. There are no visible breaks or irregularities in the deck that might suggest digital distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the graffiti elements on the ramps and walls rendered as animated digital displays rather than static paint, with smooth transitions and no pixelation or jagged outlines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the graffiti elements have a vibrant, animated quality, enhanced by digital effects that give an impression of fluid motion and interactivity. This is achieved through smooth gradients and dynamic lines, which create a seamless digital illusion without pixelation or jagged edges, indicating a high level of graphic refinement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the neon highlights on the armor and hoverboard cast soft, consistent glows on nearby surfaces without creating harsh, unrealistic reflections or color bleed?",
    "explanation": "Image B utilizes neon highlights that emit a soft, consistent glow across the surfaces of the armor and hoverboard. The light diffusion is evenly applied, avoiding excessive brightness or harsh lines that would disrupt the visual balance. The glow harmonizes with the environment, subtly enhancing the neon aesthetic without resulting in unrealistic reflections or color bleed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the motion lines positioned along the trajectory of the skater and hoverboard, following natural flow without intersecting or overlapping key features like limbs or the board in an implausible manner?",
    "explanation": "The motion lines in Image B are strategically placed along the path of movement for the skater and hoverboard, reinforcing the sense of speed and direction. These lines follow a coherent flow, enhancing the dynamic movement without disrupting key features. They align well with the trajectory and avoid overlapping vital elements like limbs or the board, maintaining a clear and plausible depiction of motion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
