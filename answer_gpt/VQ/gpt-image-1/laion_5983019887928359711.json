    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the hair exhibit consistent curl patterns and volumetric continuity without visible distortions such as broken strands, unnatural bulges, or abrupt changes in thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair presents consistent and smooth curling patterns, typical of powdered wigs from historical European fashion, characterized by rounded, well-defined curls. This observation aligns with common representations of wigs in the 18th century, indicating an absence of distortions like broken strands or abrupt thickness changes. The volumetric continuity is maintained as the curls flow naturally from the scalp downwards. This conclusion is drawn from the overall uniformity in shape and thickness of each curl visible.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the golden embroidery patterns evenly spaced and continuous along the red coat, with no jagged edges or missing segments that suggest artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the golden embroidery on the red coat as intricately detailed and evenly spaced, conforming with traditional embroidery designs that feature a consistent ornamental floral pattern. The visual inspection shows no jagged edges or interruptions in the embroidery, which suggests skillful replication of classical embroidery techniques, maintaining visual harmony. The execution of the pattern on the edited image lacks artifacting and presents a continuous ornamental design.",

      "question": "Does the blue sash follow a smooth, gravity-consistent drape from the shoulder to the waist without unnatural creases or overlapping inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue sash drapes naturally from the shoulder to the waist, adhering to realistic physics of fabric resting under gravity. It exhibits a smooth contour with gentle curves and lacks unnatural creases or overlapping inconsistencies. This visual flow aligns with the common representation of sashes in portraits of historical nobility, suggesting an authentic interpretation of fabric behavior.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the coat, sash, and skin show coherent shading and specular reflections that align with a single light source, avoiding inconsistent gloss or floating highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates coherent shading across surfaces of the coat, sash, and skin, consistent with a singular light source cast. The highlights and shadows follow a logical path, contributing dimension without unwanted glossiness or floating highlights. This suggests an understanding of light behavior on differing materials and correctly matches typical portrait lighting, with specular reflections appropriately placed.",

      "question": "Is the white lace cravat properly aligned with the neck and collar, with no distortion, clipping, or unnatural stretching of the lace pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the white lace cravat aligned neatly with the neck and collar, with intricate lace details portrayed consistently. There is no observable distortion, clipping, or stretching, which implies a natural fit, accurately reflecting historical lace cravat designs. The lace appears intact and layered appropriately, indicating skilled rendering without errors.",
