      "question": "Are the sunglasses on the horse's face free of unnatural textures and artifacts, maintaining a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse depicted appears in a stylized, chibi sculpture form, within a box labeled 'Sunset Serenity.' The sunglasses on this small horse model are represented as rounded spectacles. The entire scene, including the horse and its sunglasses, follows a simplified, cartoon-like aesthetic. There are no apparent signs of digital artifacts, rough edges, or texture inconsistencies within the stylized context, making the sunglasses appear consistent with the chosen aesthetic. Thus, the sunglasses do not show unnatural textures or artifacts and maintain a natural appearance within this specific artistic style.",

      "question": "Does the horse's facial structure maintain structural consistency and visual credibility despite the addition of sunglasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a chibi-style horse model inside a jewelry-like box. The horse's facial structure is simplified and stylized with rounded features and proportions that fit the design theme. The sunglasses added to this model are consistent with the overall design style and do not disrupt the coherence of the facial structure. Given the artistic nature, the structural consistency is well maintained, with the horse's features aligning complementarily with the accessories. Thus, the facial structure maintains visual credibility within the stylized form.",

      "question": "Are the horse's fur texture and details preserved without any loss or unnatural artifacts introduced by the sunglasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is represented as a simplified sculpture within a decorative box, primarily emphasizing stylistic elements rather than photorealistic textures. The design does not focus on detailed, realistic fur texture, but rather smooth and uniform surfaces. The addition of sunglasses does not introduce any unnatural artifacts or disrupt the aesthetic continuity, as the model retains consistent stylistic traits. Given this artistic context, details like realistic fur are not present nor expected, hence no loss or unnatural disruptions due to the sunglasses.",

      "question": "Do the sunglasses' material and reflections appear realistic and consistent with the lighting conditions of the sunset scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is crafted in a stylized form within a sunset-themed box. The sunglasses are depicted as rounded metal frames without intricate reflections or realistic material cues typical of sunset lighting conditions. Because the entire setting uses a simplistic style rather than realistic elements, the material of the sunglasses does not display conventional reflections or light interactions typical for a sunset scenario. Therefore, realism and lighting consistency are inherently different due to the artistic nature of the representation.",

      "question": "Are the horse's eyes visible and undistorted under the sunglasses, preserving their natural shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoonish horse model where the position and expression of the eyes follow a stylized character design. The sunglasses obscure the eyes, adhering to the chosen style, so the expectations for natural visibility and shape that apply to photorealistic representations do not apply here. It fits the overall artistic vision rather than exact anatomical accuracy, meaning the eyes are not visible and their preservation under the sunglasses isn't relevant within this artistic context.",
