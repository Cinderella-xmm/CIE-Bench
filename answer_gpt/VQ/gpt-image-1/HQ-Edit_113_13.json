      "question": "Does the leaf crown on the fox’s head have natural leaf shapes, consistent texture, and proper alignment with the head without visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fox's leaf crown is examined for its shape, texture, and alignment. The leaf shapes are stylized but maintain a naturalistic look appropriate to the art style. The texture is simple as expected in cartoon-style illustrations, allowing seamless blending with the character's head without visible seams or unnatural edges, thus creating a coherent visual without interruptions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fox’s hind legs properly aligned and proportioned when standing upright, with no distorted joints, unnatural curvature, or missing limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fox is in an upright position, characteristic of animated cartoon styles. The hind legs are checked for alignment and proportion relative to the rest of the body. The stance appears intentional for an anthropomorphic fox, without evident distortion or missing parts, matching commonly stylized forms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tree outlines in the background maintain clean, continuous lines without jagged edges, overlapping inconsistencies, or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background with stylized trees having outlines that are minimal to fit the cartoon aesthetic. The tree lines are smooth, continuous, and avoid jagged or broken edges, which enhance image cohesion and match the illustrative style effectively.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pastel colors applied uniformly across the forest floor and foliage without creating unnatural color bleeding, pixelation, or loss of fine details like moss texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pastel colors in Image B create a soft, uniform palette typical of cartoon settings. While the image focuses on simplicity with muted tones, this style inherently does not feature detailed textures such as moss. The colors are applied uniformly, with no signs of bleeding or pixelation, fitting the illustrative approach.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the speech bubble positioned at a plausible distance from the fox, with correct shadowing and edge blending that matches the lighting and depth of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubble is positioned fairly close to the fox, common in cartoon design to emphasize dialogue. Its positioning matches the whimsical context of the scene, although there is no complex shadowing or depth blending necessary in this style, it integrates smoothly with the visual arrangement.",
