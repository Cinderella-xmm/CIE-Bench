      "question": "Do the transformed buildings exhibit smooth, metallic textures without unnatural pixelation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings present a sleek, futuristic design with metallic surfaces. The textures appear smooth and consistent, indicative of polished metal-like materials. There is an absence of pixelation or blurring across these surfaces, which suggests that the textures have been rendered with detailed precision. This seamless look is a hallmark of high-quality digital rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossom trees and traditional architectural features like the pagoda seamlessly integrated with the futuristic buildings without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a blend of traditional and futuristic elements, such as cherry blossom trees and pagoda-style structures alongside modern, metallic buildings. The integration is achieved through careful compositionâ€”both the traditional and futuristic elements share a common color palette and atmosphere, which helps them coexist without visual dissonance. The cherry blossom trees continue to anchor the scene with a touch of natural beauty that complements the metallic architecture.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the proportions and shapes of the buildings been preserved logically, ensuring no broken or distorted geometric forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings maintain consistent proportions and their geometric forms align with typical futuristic architectural aesthetics. The structures present in the image show no signs of distortion; the lines and angles are coherent and symmetrical. This consistency in shaping reinforces the logical integrity of the scene and suggests careful attention to maintaining geometric correctness during editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the buildings, such as window frames and roof edges, clearly visible and free from unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the buildings feature distinct and precise details such as window frames and roof edges, which are clearly defined against the smooth metallic surfaces. These elements are depicted with clarity and lack any unnatural textures or inconsistencies that might arise from poor editing or rendering. This attention to detail enhances the overall realism and quality of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the scene, including the placement of the buildings and cherry blossom trees, appear visually credible and harmonious?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of Image B is balanced, with a harmonious layout where futuristic buildings and natural elements like cherry blossom trees merge seamlessly. The spatial arrangement is organized such that all elements have their place without overcrowding or imbalance, maintaining a sensible flow and visual coherence throughout the scene. This well-planned layout contributes to the scenic believability and aesthetic appeal.",
