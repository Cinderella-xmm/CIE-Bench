      "question": "Does the transformed lantern maintain its original symmetrical shape and geometric proportions without visible distortion or broken lattice patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a box with intricate patterns on its surface. The original lantern in Image A had symmetrical shapes and geometric patterns. The patterns on Image B, especially those similar to the lantern's patterns, appear symmetrical and consistent, without any distortions, resembling a design similar to the original lantern's lattice aesthetic. Therefore, the box maintains a symmetrical and proportionate design.",

      "question": "Is the metallic embossed flame logo on the lantern's surface consistent with the surrounding material, showing realistic depth and reflections without unnatural edges or color mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flame logo appears to be part of an embossed design that blends into the surrounding surface seamlessly. The depth and reflections look natural, and there are no visible mismatches in color or unnatural edges, indicating a cohesive integration with the surrounding embossed pattern.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the marketplace elements converted into side textures of the packaging clearly recognizable as derived from the original scene but stylized appropriately, without distortion or loss of fine detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging sides feature intricate patterns that resemble decorative elements potentially inspired by the marketplace scene in Image A. However, these textures are abstract and stylized, making it challenging to directly recognize marketplace elements as derived from Image A. Therefore, this suggests there is a loss of recognizable detail.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays deep gold and amber tones on the packaging, which blend seamlessly with the overall design and lighting. The tones reflect a warm, natural transition consistent with an elegant material finish, avoiding any harsh transitions or unnatural effects.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouette of the scented candle in Image B is centrally positioned and appears well-aligned with the surrounding design elements. The scale is proportional to the size of the packaging, and it integrates harmoniously into the overall design, with no visible artifacts disrupting its appearance.",
