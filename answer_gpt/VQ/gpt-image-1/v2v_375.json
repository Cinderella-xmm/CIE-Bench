      "question": "Do the chibi-style characters maintain natural proportions and avoid unnatural distortion in their body shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi characters are typically depicted with exaggerated proportions, featuring large heads and small bodies, which is a common style choice that gives them a cute and playful appearance. In Image B, both characters exhibit these traits, and their proportions align with expected chibi styling. Therefore, their body shapes do not show any unnatural distortion within the context of the chibi art style.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backdrop presents a consistent and harmonious color scheme in ruby-red, commonly associated with joy and weddings in Chinese culture.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The designs on the outfits are stylized to fit the chibi aesthetic, meaning that while they aren't hyper-detailed, they are appropriately decorated with recognizable motifs, like dragons and phoenixes, that match the cultural context. The coherence of these designs is consistent with the level of detail typically seen in chibi art, avoiding unnatural textures and maintaining clarity in their representation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of Image B maintains a balanced integration of all elements.

The consistency of the art style and thematic elements contribute to a visually credible composition.",
