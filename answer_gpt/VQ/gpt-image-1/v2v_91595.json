      "question": "Does the mechanical eye seamlessly integrate with the camera's original form without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical eye of the owl is integrated into the camera body. The materials and textures blend well with the existing camera aesthetics, featuring detailed gears and cogwheels that complement the metallic and engineered look of a camera. The fine details are maintained, and there are no visible unnatural textures where the owl's eye integrates with the camera.",

      "question": "Do the copper feathers appear naturally integrated with the camera's casing, maintaining the overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The copper feathers in Image B are artistically added around the camera's body, creating the appearance of an owl. They are intricately designed and seem to be a part of the camera's form, suggesting a steampunk style. The integration looks intentional and stylish, without breaking the authenticity or the natural flow of the camera's design.",

      "question": "Are the gears and springs within the battery compartment depicted in a way that preserves the structural consistency and visual credibility of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gears and springs within the battery compartment replace the usual battery design. These mechanical parts appear deliberately designed to fit the space that would normally house a battery, contributing to the camera's steampunk theme. They maintain structural consistency with the camera body while creating a visually believable mechanical aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the camera and the clockwork owl elements create a visually credible and coherent scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The combination of the camera and owl features in Image B is creatively implemented, forming a cohesive steampunk-themed piece. The gears, copper feathers, and mechanical eye transform the camera into a clockwork owl without jarring transitions, making the composition visually coherent. The elements are well-proportioned and artistically integrated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical rationality of the added elements, such as the mechanical eye and copper feathers, avoid distortion and maintain a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical eye and copper feathers have been added with careful proportioning that complements the camera's original design. The positioning and size of these elements do not appear distorted and fit naturally within the existing camera body, suggesting a thoughtful and balanced design.",
