    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the moss textures on the tusks follow the curvature of the tusks and cast consistent shadows matching the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moss textures appear to grow along the curvature of the tusks, draping and adhering to their shape. The shadows cast by the moss are consistent with a downward lighting direction, suggesting a coherent integration with the tusks' curves. This observation aligns with the natural behavior of moss, which tends to follow the shapes of the surfaces it grows on, and the shadows confirm the lighting consistency.",

      "question": "Does the waterfall-like mane flow continuously from the top of the head downward without intersecting or distorting the snout or ear regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the mane is illustrated as a continuous flow of hair that extends from the top of the warthog's head. It cascades down without distortions or intersections that would disrupt the snout or ear regions, maintaining a natural flow. The placement is deliberate and avoids interfering with the structural anatomy of the warthog's facial features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the leaf-styled patterns aligned with the natural folds and contours of the warthogâ€™s body, avoiding abrupt edges or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaf-styled patterns in Image B are intricately designed to follow the natural contours and folds of the warthog's body. These patterns are harmonious with the animal's shape and do not present any abrupt edges or misaligned segments, which would otherwise disrupt the visual consistency and natural appearance of the design.",

      "question": "Are the fungi positioned along the spine and upper back without overlapping legs or protruding unnaturally into the air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fungi are depicted as growing along the spine and back of the warthog. They are positioned such that they align with the upper curvature of the body and do not overlap the legs or appear floating in the air, which maintains a natural and grounded appearance, simulating realistic growth patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing eyes remain within the eye sockets, preserving the shape of the eyelids and surrounding facial features without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing eyes in Image B are positioned within the eye sockets, preserving the anatomical structure of the warthog's eyes and eyelids. There is no visible distortion in the surrounding facial features, ensuring that the glow effect is contained and does not alter the natural shapes and contours of the face.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the branch-shaped hooves connect naturally to the lower legs and maintain consistent joint alignment without breaking the leg structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the hooves are stylized as branches that seamlessly integrate with the lower legs. These branch-shaped hooves maintain correct joint alignment, ensuring that the structural integrity of the warthog's legs is preserved without any apparent breaks or unnatural angles.",
