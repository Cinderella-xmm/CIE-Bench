    "Question": "Q1: Does the word \"warm\" blend seamlessly into the top left corner without disrupting the natural appearance and introducing any unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the word \"warm\" in large, bold text occupies the top left corner. A seamless blend means the text integrates into the background without creating any noticeable distractions or disrupting the overall visual flow. The design choice, including color harmony and style, mirrors the adaptive integration of such text in interior design ads, where text often overlays with minimal interference. The text does not show pixelation, misalignment, or incongruity with the background. Therefore, it blends in without seeming unnatural.",
