    "Question": "Q1: Is the pelican's beak elongated but still attached naturally to the head without bending or breaking at the base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's beak is cartoonish and very exaggerated in length, which is typical in stylized illustrations. It appears attached to the head without any visible bending or breaking; the beak flows naturally into the design of the head despite its exaggerated size. It retains a look of cohesion with the pelican's head, suggesting it is part of a stylistically whole design.",
