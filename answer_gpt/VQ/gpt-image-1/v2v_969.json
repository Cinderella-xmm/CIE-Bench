      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D figures inside the snow globe maintain the correct proportions and avoid unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style 3D figures are inspected for proportions and possible distortions. The figures have cartoon-like features that are consistent with chibi-style art, which typically includes exaggerated head sizes and simplified limbs. The proportions align correctly with this style and there are no visible geometric distortions. Thus, the figures look natural in their cartoonish form.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a light layer of snow within the snow globe, resting on the grass. It is examined for realism, particularly for any unnatural textures or artifacts. The snow is depicted with a soft and uniform texture, consistent with typical snowfall in snow globes. Its appearance integrates well with the scene without any apparent artifacts, contributing to a natural look.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe rest naturally on the rustic wooden shelf with soft sunlight filtering through, creating believable warm, golden reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the snow globe resting on a wooden shelf. The scene's lighting is assessed for warmth and natural reflections. The sunlight filtering through has a warm tint, casting golden reflections and shadows that interact naturally with the wooden textures. This creates a believable and cohesive scene with no disruptions in the reflection quality.",

      "question": "Are the bats propped against the fence inside the snow globe depicted with natural textures and shapes, avoiding any distortion or unnatural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the baseball bats within the snow globe are assessed for texture fidelity and realistic shape. They are well-rendered with consistent wood grain textures and appropriate proportions, matching what would be expected from real baseball bats. There are no signs of distortion or artificiality, maintaining a credible appearance.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the interior scene of the snow globe and the external backdrop is examined. The backdrop, portraying a vintage baseball clubhouse, blends seamlessly with the snow globe scene. There are no visible lines or artifacts disrupting continuity, allowing for a cohesive and smooth transition without interruptive visual breaks.",
