    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the hull of the ship display smooth, consistent translucency and iridescent color shifts across its surface without blocky or repeated patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the hull of a ship designed entirely with crystal-like translucency and iridescent color shifts. The surface appears smooth and consistent without any evident blocky or repeated patterns. This design choice resembles real crystal structures where uniform translucency is prized, staying clear of any artificial blocky patterns that would betray poor editing or design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the windows on the ship's decks replaced with clearly defined, faceted gem-like shapes that reflect light naturally and maintain consistent depth and edge sharpness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship's windows are transformed into faceted gem-like shapes. These shapes reflect light naturally and exhibit consistent depth and sharp edges, akin to facets on gemstones that reflect and refract light, providing a convincing and polished look.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the deck surfaces appear as continuous, structured crystal pathways with no floating pieces, cracks, or abrupt transitions between crystal and non-crystal areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the deck surfaces as continuous crystal pathways, structured without floating pieces, cracks, or abrupt transitions. This continuity reflects a careful design approach where crystal-like deck surfaces are consistently maintained.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the superstructure of the ship transformed into angular, faceted crystal forms with clean edges and correct proportions, without warped or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the ship's superstructure with angular, faceted crystal forms that have clean edges and correct proportions, avoiding any signs of warped or collapsed geometry. The transformation maintains architectural integrity and aesthetic coherence with its crystalline theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the background been adjusted to a minimalistic horizon with softened or removed distant islands, while maintaining a smooth transition between the water and sky without visual breaks or mismatches in brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a minimalistic horizon where distant islands are softened or removed, allowing for a smooth transition between water and sky. The adjustments create a visually uninterrupted and harmonized backdrop for the crystal ship.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the crystal ship positioned correctly on the water surface with no floating portions or misaligned base, and does it maintain proper scale relative to the surrounding water and horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates correct positioning of the crystal ship on the water surface, with no floating portions or misalignment. The scale of the ship appears appropriate relative to the surrounding water and horizon, ensuring spatial coherence and realistic anchoring.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the crystal surfaces free from repetitive textures, blurred edges, or ghosting effects that suggest digital artifacts or poor synthesis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents crystal surfaces that are free from repetitive textures, blurred edges, or ghosting effects, thereby avoiding any digital artifacts. The surfaces are sharp and well-defined, indicating quality synthesis in the editing process.",
