    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head-to-body ratio of the figure exaggerated but still structurally coherent, with no visible warping or misalignment of facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure exhibits a distinctly enlarged head compared to the body, consistent with chibi-style illustrations where proportions favor larger heads for a cuter aesthetic. This is a deliberate artistic choice and maintains a coherent structure, indicating no visible warping or misalignment if we ignore facial features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dress exhibit a smooth, consistent porcelain-like surface with no rough patches, texture artifacts, or unnatural glare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B has a smooth and consistent texture, resembling porcelain, which is common in high-quality manufactured figurines. The surface appears to be free of rough patches, texture artifacts, or unnatural glare, suggesting careful design and execution.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lamb positioned in the lap with sufficient volume and soft texture, and does it rest naturally within the hands without clipping or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamb has a voluminous and soft texture appropriate for its depiction, resembling a plush toy or figurine element. It rests naturally within the hands of the figure without any visible clipping or floating, indicating thoughtful placement and integration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the base beneath the figure aligned with the foreground plane and does it blend seamlessly with the background without casting incorrect shadows or creating floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B appears to be aligned with the foreground plane, creating a seamless transition with the background. This alignment helps prevent visual errors like floating or improperly cast shadows, demonstrating appropriate integration of all elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the eyes proportionally enlarged but symmetrically placed, with no distortion in shape or spacing relative to the nose and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the face is blurred, it is impossible to assess the symmetry, shape, or spacing of the eyes in relation to other facial features through direct observation of Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural joint alignment and no extra or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands in Image B are stylized, and visibility is blocked by the lamb. It is hard to confirm the number of fingers but based on standard modeling practices for chibi figures, this typically implies attention to anatomical details like correct number and alignment of digits.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the necklace and pendant clearly visible with consistent metallic texture and no pixelation or blurring around edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the necklace and pendant are depicted with clear visibility. The metallic texture appears consistent and there is no sign of pixelation or blurring around the edges, indicating careful attention to detail during the editing process.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the background retain the original sky gradient, horizon line, and mountain silhouette without visible seams or color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B maintains the visual continuity expected from a consistent illustration, with a smooth sky gradient, horizon line, and mountain silhouette. These elements are well-integrated without visible seams or color shifts, preserving the integrity of the scenic view.",
