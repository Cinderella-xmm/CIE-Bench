      "question": "Does the birdâ€™s body maintain accurate proportions and feather structure, with no distorted limbs, misplaced joints, or exaggerated features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is depicted with a cute and stylized design, given that this is a crafted model inside a glass dome. The proportions are intentionally simplified and exaggerated to create a distinctive, toy-like appearance. Common features of such designs include rounded body parts and simplified structures. Given this context, the bird maintains the accurate proportions expected for its intended art style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass dome transparent with smooth surfaces, showing consistent reflections and refractions without visible seams, distortions, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome surrounding the bird appears clear and smooth. There are no visible artifacts or imperfections like seams or pixelation. The reflections and refractions appear consistent with the properties of glass, indicating a focus on creating a realistic look for the model.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wooden perch textured with realistic grain and positioned securely under the bird, with no gaps or floating sections suggesting instability?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden perch upon which the bird sits is stylized and simplified. It does not aim to mimic realistic wood grain exactly but rather serves as a supportive base in a crafted model. The perch ensures the bird's stability within the display, showing no signs of floating or misalignment.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the ivy vines curve naturally upward along the structure, with leaves spaced appropriately and no overlapping or clipping through the glass dome or bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ivy vines are neatly arranged around the small tree within the glass dome. They curve naturally and aesthetically, with leaves correctly positioned around the vine. There are no signs of overlapping or clipping through the dome or the bird, maintaining the cohesive design of the model.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crafted leaves and tree stump proportionally small compared to the bird, with visible texture details and positioned on the moss-covered base without appearing out of place or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves and the tree stump are proportionally small relative to the bird, as depicted in a cute, ornamental style. They are placed on a mossy base, which provides a consistent and cohesive scene element, making them appear integrated into the overall design without any misalignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the moss-covered base show variation in color and texture, resembling real organic growth, with no sharp edges or uniformity suggesting digital pasting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base upon which the bird and tree sit is covered with a textured moss surface, achieving variation in color and texture that reflects organic growth. The design avoids sharp edges and unnatural uniformity, indicating a deliberate approach to crafting the appearance of a realistic scene.",

      "question": "Are shadows cast by the bird, perch, and dome consistent with the light source in the upper right, with soft gradients and no mismatched highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light source implies illumination from the upper right, and shadows are rendered to reflect this directionality. The gradients are soft, and highlights match the direction and intensity of the light source, ensuring visual coherence within the crafted scene.",
