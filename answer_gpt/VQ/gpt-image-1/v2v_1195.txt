    "Question": "Q3: Does the stained glass effect applied to the countertop and backsplash tiles appear natural without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "The countertop and backsplash tiles in Image B are transformed into stained glass tiles with distinct color blocks.

    "Question": "Q5: Do the details of the objects, such as the skateboard wheels and cabinet handles, remain authentic and detailed within the stained glass style, avoiding any degradation of fine details?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although the objects have been stylized into stained glass, essential details like the skateboard wheels and cabinet handles are identifiable. The stained glass effect inherently simplifies certain elements, yet it does not erase or poorly render these features, maintaining authenticity and avoiding critical loss of detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
