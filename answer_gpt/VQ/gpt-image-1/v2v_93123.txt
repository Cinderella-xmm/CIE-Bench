    "Question": "Q1: Does the lighting on the man and the pineapple appear consistent with the new aged blackboard background, without introducing unnatural shadows or highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to be consistent across the elements. The warm tones of the lighting on both the man and the pineapple match the subtle, aged appearance of the blackboard. The lighting seems to blend naturally without creating any noticeable shadows or highlights that would indicate a mismatch.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are there any visible artifacts or unnatural edges where the man and the pineapple meet the new aged blackboard background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the edges of the man and pineapple and the blackboard background appears smooth. No obvious artifacts like awkward lines or pixelation signify that the editing around these areas was carefully done.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the chalk-written equations and galactic sketches on the new blackboard background integrate naturally with the man and the pineapple, maintaining structural coherence?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chalk-written equations and galactic sketches create a coherent context that complements and integrates smoothly with the presence of the man and the pineapple. The educational and scientific theme corresponds well with the imagery and maintains uniformity in the setting without any structural incoherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Have the proportions and details of the man and the pineapple been preserved, avoiding any distortion or loss of fine details?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the man and the pineapple maintain their natural proportions and details. The texture on the pineapple is clear, and the man's clothing retains its detailed texture, suggesting that the editing did not distort or lose any fine details.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the texture of the new aged blackboard background complement the man and the pineapple, without introducing any unnatural or conflicting textures?",
    "explanation": "The aged texture of the blackboard seamlessly complements the scene with the man and the pineapple in Image B. The textures are consistent and cohesive, with no conflicting or clashing elements that might detract from the overall visual harmony.",
