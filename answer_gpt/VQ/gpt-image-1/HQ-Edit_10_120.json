      "question": "Does the fabric of the qipao display a uniform silk-like watercolor texture without visible seams, blocky patches, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the qipao fabric does indeed display a uniform watercolor-like texture, akin to a silk appearance. It lacks visible seams, blocky patches, or inconsistent shading, which is typically how watercolor and silk might be represented due to their fine texture and smooth gradient. The editing gives the fabric a seamless and fluid appearance, which aligns with a watercolored silk painting style often found in artistic illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gold foil accents on the floral patterns aligned with the flower shapes and do they show realistic reflection behavior based on the surrounding lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold accents are integrated within the floral patterns and appear to align smoothly with the shapes of the flowers. However, the reflective behavior of the gold foil seems more artistic and stylized than realistic. This type of reflection is typical in artistic renditions where lighting realism is adjusted for aesthetic value rather than photorealistic behavior.",

      "question": "Is the floral border continuous and properly aligned along all four edges of the image without gaps, overlaps, or distorted elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral border in Image B showcases a well-arranged design that is continuous and aligned properly along the edges. With an artistic quality, it gives a balanced appearance without evident gaps, overlaps, or distortions. This suggests a careful design process typical in postcard artwork, where such alignment is quintessential for aesthetic appeal.",

      "question": "Are the branches forming the writing space correctly shaped, evenly spaced, and free from unnatural bends or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branches in Image B framing the writing space appear correctly shaped and spaced, offering a natural curve with no visible unnatural bends or disconnection. This structure is reflective of artistic design principles, where balance and flow are emphasized to create a harmonious visual frame for text.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ivory paper texture visible in the background but does not interfere with the clarity or detail of the person or clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an ivory background texture that subtly complements the design without overpowering the clarity or detail of the subject and clothing. This style is typical of watercolor artwork, where the paper texture is part of the aesthetic but does not distract from the main focal details.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both hands show five fingers each with natural joint angles and skin texture, and are they positioned in a way that matches human anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands appear to have some stylization typical of illustrations, but they contain five fingers each. While the illustration captures the essence of human anatomy, the artistic representation does not perfectly mimic realistic joint angles or skin texture. This stylization is often used in artworks to emphasize certain aesthetic attributes over strict anatomical accuracy.",
