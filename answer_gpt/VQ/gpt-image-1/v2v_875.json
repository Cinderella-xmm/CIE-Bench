      "question": "Are the edges of the palm tree and cactus seamlessly integrated into the Polaroid frame without visible artifacts or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm tree is captured within the Polaroid frame and appears seamlessly integrated without any visible artifacts or unnatural breaks. The cactus is represented in a 3D chibi style, visually distinct from the cactus in Image A, replacing it rather than continuing its edges. The integration in the Polaroid frame appears smooth without breaks between the frame and the palm tree.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style cactus maintain its original green color and texture, avoiding unnatural color shifts or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D chibi-style cactus in Image B has a vivid green color, typical of cartoon representations and does not shift from its known texture or color scheme. Compared to the original cactus in Image A, the chibi cactus maintains a playful green with consistent cartoon characteristics, showing no signs of unnatural color shifts or loss of texture detail.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the human hand holding the Polaroid photograph appear anatomically correct with natural skin texture and no more than five fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The human hand visible in Image B that holds the Polaroid photograph appears naturally shaped, with visible skin texture that aligns with anatomical realism, and contains no more than five fingers, making it anatomically correct. Observing the hand, it provides all necessary characteristics of a typical human hand without error.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition where the 3D chibi-style cactus appears to break out of the Polaroid frame smooth and believable, without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition of the 3D chibi-style cactus breaking out of the Polaroid frame in Image B is smooth. The cactus presents a consistent 3D cartoon look without distorted or broken geometric shapes as it emerges from the image, maintaining a clear separation yet plausible integration within the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the palm tree, cactus, and the 3D chibi-style cactus align naturally with the light source in the image, avoiding any artificial highlights or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B suggests a consistent light source that aligns with the shadows and highlights observed on both the palm tree and the 3D chibi-style cactus. The cactus maintains a coherent shadowing effect that complements the Polaroid image theme without artificial or mismatched lighting artifacts, ensuring natural lighting consistency.",
