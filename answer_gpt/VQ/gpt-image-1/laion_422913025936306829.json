    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the color blocks applied across the shirtâ€™s surface uniform and sharply defined, with no visible smudging or blending between adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the colors are bright and vivid, with clearly defined lines and regions. This creates a sharp and uniform appearance, with no visible smudging or blending between colors. The use of high-contrast colors helps in achieving this crisp distinction between color blocks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the neon-colored patterns repeat consistently across the shirt, maintaining symmetry and alignment with the original layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a central figure with a consistent geometric pattern surrounding it. These patterns maintain the vibrancy and continuity of design elements like zig-zags, concentric circles, and other shapes. However, these are applied to the graphic itself rather than across an entire shirt as the question implies, which Image B doesn't fully illustrate as a wearable item.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the limbs and torso of the central figure proportionally accurate, with no exaggerated or broken joint lines that violate physical realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is stylized with neon colors and bold outlines, but the anatomical proportions are maintained without exaggeration. The joints, such as the elbow and knee, appear intact and consistent with a stylized yet physically plausible human form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details such as facial features, hair texture, and ornamental lines clearly visible and unbroken in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a central figure rendered in vibrant, flat colors with visible outlines. The facial features and other details like hair and patterns are distinctly outlined and visible, thanks to the use of contrasting colors and thick black outlines. These details are unbroken and clearly defined.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the central figure properly aligned within the circular frame, with no misalignment or distortion of the bordering geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure appears within a clear circular frame that includes geometric patterns. The alignment seems well-matched with no apparent skewing or misalignment of the surrounding design elements. The circular frame is symmetrically aligned around the figure, indicating proper positioning.",
