        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital display screen occupies the same space as the painting in Image A. It is framed similarly, suggesting the proportions and alignment have been maintained. The screen follows the rectangular shape, fitting seamlessly in the intended area. This is evident as there are no visible gaps or misalignments between the display and the surrounding wall frame.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital display screen in Image B looks smooth and consistent with the wall in terms of color and lighting, indicating it has been well-integrated without discrepancies.

      "question": "Are all the details around the digital display screen, such as the wall edges and the flooring, preserved without any visible distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the wall edges around the digital display and the wooden flooring appear unchanged and free from distortion. The features, such as the lines and shadowing on the floor, maintain their integrity, indicating that the transition to a digital screen was executed while preserving the surrounding details.",

      "question": "Does the digital display screen preserve the balance and symmetry of the room, with the armchairs still appearing naturally aligned relative to the new display screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armchairs retain their position relative to the display area, which has been changed from a painting to a digital screen. The spatial arrangement remains symmetric and balanced, as the chairs are evenly spaced on either side of the screen, supporting the room's overall aesthetic integrity.",

      "question": "Do the shadows and light reflections cast by the digital display screen match those expected from a wall-mounted object, without creating unrealistic or conflicting lighting patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadowing around the digital display are consistent with what one would expect from a flat, wall-mounted object. There are no unusual or conflicting shadows, suggesting that the integration of the digital screen respects the room's lighting context and maintains realistic light behavior.",
