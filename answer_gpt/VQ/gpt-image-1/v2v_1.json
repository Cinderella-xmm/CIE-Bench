      "question": "Does the themed box appear to have a natural industrial aesthetic without any visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the themed box exhibits an industrial aesthetic with metallic accents and rugged textures that mimic a vintage toolbox or container. The rivets, hinges, and metal plate on the box contribute to the industrial look, and the surface finishes are smooth and consistent, without any visible artifacts or unrealistic elements. These details, combined with the background, suggest an attention to authentic industrial design, implying that there's a natural industrial aesthetic present.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and angles of the themed box in isometric perspective consistent and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the box with clean lines and precise angles that fit the characteristics of an isometric perspective. The dimensions of the box, including its height, width, and depth, appear well-proportioned, and all angles seem consistent with the concept of isometric drawing where parallel lines remain parallel and angles remain unchanged. This results in a cohesive and distortion-free appearance, emphasizing geometric accuracy.",

      "question": "Do the bearings and components inside the box retain their fine details and appear precise without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bearings and components are distinctly presented. Their surfaces reflect light accurately, and detailed elements like grooves and metallic finishes maintain their precision and clarity. Each piece fits perfectly into their compartment, exhibiting high attention to detail without any blurred or lost elements. This sharpness in components illustrates a refined and deliberate design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the metallic texture and intricate design of the primary bearing outside the box rendered photorealistically without any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The primary bearing outside the box in Image B is displayed with a high level of detail and realistic rendering. The metallic surface shows natural reflections and textures consistent with stainless steel or similar metals. The intricate design features visible grooves and smooth surface transitions that contribute to photorealism. No unnatural textures or artifacts are noticeable, underscoring the accurate representation of material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bearings and components arranged in an organized manner both inside and outside the box, contributing to visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, there's a clear organization of bearings and components both inside and outside the box. The interior compartments are specifically sized to hold the bearings in a neat, organized layout, which enhances the credibility of the presentation. Outside the box, the primary bearing is deliberately placed next to the open container, maintaining an orderly and visually coherent arrangement that aligns with logical storage practices.",
