      "question": "Does the womanâ€™s face exhibit natural contours and shading without visible unnatural textures or blotches in the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor effect is applied to the entire image including the woman's face. The style typically aims for smooth transitions and soft edges without pronounced textures or blotches. When examining the face, the depiction relies on gentle shades and contours to represent depth and dimension, typical in watercolor artwork where fine details are softened but remain natural without harsh or irregular textures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the background figures appropriately simplified with light lines and washes, avoiding unnatural geometric breaks or inconsistencies in their form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background figures are depicted using watercolor techniques, which often simplify forms using light washes and soft lines. This approach creates a natural transition and cohesion between shapes without harsh geometric divisions or inconsistencies. The figures are represented in a generalized manner with smooth and coherent shapes that match typical watercolor simplification.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the woman's hand holding the wine glass composed of five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, avoiding unnatural artifacts or shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the woman's hand is done with careful attention to its natural anatomy: five fingers with appropriate curvature and spacing are visible. The watercolor style captures these shapes subtly without introducing unusual artifacts or alterations. The hand maintains a realistic structure in line with artistic conventions for watercolor layouts.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wine glass appear transparent with subtle reflections, consistent with its real-life properties, without losing fine details or becoming overly stylized in the watercolor transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wine glass is designed to mimic transparency and reflection properties typically seen in glass objects. The watercolor application retains these details by employing subtle reflections and varying tones within the glass structure, capturing its real-life characteristics while maintaining the artistic style. The depiction avoids excessive stylization that would obscure or overemphasize features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and interactions between the woman, her glass, and the table appear consistent with lighting and spatial positioning, avoiding any visual distortion or floating effects after the watercolor transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor style addresses the interplay between objects and their shadows. The interaction between the woman, her glass, and the table relies on consistent lighting placement. The shadows are appropriately positioned, maintaining contact points and spatial relations without distortion or floating effects. The smooth blending of shadows into the watercolor ambiance supports coherence in spatial interaction.",
