      "question": "Do the wing areas of the swan exhibit a consistent frosted glass texture that matches the lighting and translucency of the original ice material without visible seams or unnatural surface distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the wing areas of the swan bottle exhibit a consistent frosted glass texture. The lighting appears uniform across the surface, enhancing the translucent effect inherently, which is consistent with the appearance of ice material. Notably, there are no visible seams or surface distortions observed. Combining world knowledge about frosted glass, it is known for its uniform translucency and texture, similar to ice sculpture appearances as seen in image B. For Image A, the swan's wings also appear frosted due to the ice sculpture's nature, consistent with the ice sculpture aesthetics, supporting similar surface integrity and cohesion without distortions. Both images show consistency in texture of wing areas specific to material definitions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the neck of the swan transformed into a glass stopper with a smooth, tapered shape that maintains proportional alignment with the body and does not exhibit unnatural bending, jagged edges, or volume inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swan neck is transformed into a glass stopper that displays a smooth, tapered shape which aligns proportionally with the body. The swan-neck stopper does not exhibit any unnatural bending. Jagged edges or volume inconsistencies are absent, presenting a coherent design with a seamless transition from the neck to the tapering stopper end, consistent with world knowledge about standard glass stopper designs found in decorative glassware. In Image A, the swan's neck smoothly arcs from the body, retaining a consistent curvature and proportional balance inherent in ice sculptures, supporting structural alignment naturally. Comparing both images ensures the neck's transformation maintains aesthetic propriety and alignment without inconsistencies.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red, pink, and green decorative elements (such as pine branches and flowers) integrated into the base of the bottle in a way that avoids floating or disconnected positioning, and do they maintain natural color and texture without blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents decorative elements such as pine branches and flowers integrated seamlessly at the base of the bottle. Their position appears naturally aligned without floating or disconnected appearances. The colors—red, pink, and green—are vibrant and maintain natural texture clarity, devoid of blurring or pixelation, consistent with standard decorative element integration in glass items where texture enhancement and position continuity are maintained. Image A shows similar elements in the original ice setup integrated naturally into the composition, ensuring thematic alignment. By comparing both images, using world knowledge of botanical element integration in decor, the decorative elements maintain proportional alignment and natural texture continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the \"Winter Glow\" text clearly visible, properly aligned with the bottle's curvature, and does the iridescent effect appear smooth and continuous without unnatural color fringes or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the \"Winter Glow\" text is clearly visible and appears properly aligned to the curved surface of the bottle, maintaining visual coherence and readability across the contour. The text adopts an iridescent effect that is smooth and continuous, lacking unnatural color fringes or digital artifacts, typical for high-quality printed text on curved surfaces, enhancing aesthetic appeal through world knowledge about specialty printing on curved glass surfaces. Image A does not have comparable text, but using general design principles, adequately tests text visibility against contour continuity expected in decorative glassware lettering techniques. Comparison supports clear readability and presentation continuity without artifacts.",

      "question": "Does the overall shape of the transformed swan-bottle maintain structural coherence, with all parts proportionally aligned and without visible warping, stretching, or disjointed sections that break the continuity of the form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the swan-bottle maintaining structural coherence with proportionate alignment of all parts. The swan's shape is preserved accurately as its form transitions into a bottle without visible warping, stretching, or disjointed sections that would disrupt continuity. Such design structural integrity is supported by world knowledge and aesthetic principles seen in novelty bottle designs retaining original form features seamlessly adapting into functional structures. Image A showcases the original swan structure with natural, coherent proportions inherent to ice sculptures, devoid of structural distortions. From comparison, using design integrity principles for transformed novelty forms, the bottle retains coherence in alignment and proportion.",
