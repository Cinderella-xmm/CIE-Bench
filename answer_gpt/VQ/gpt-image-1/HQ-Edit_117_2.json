      "question": "Do the embossed tribal patterns on the ceramic pots maintain consistent texture and depth with the original material, without visible artifacts such as floating lines or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the embossed tribal patterns on the ceramic pots appear to be well-integrated into the material without floating lines or distorted geometry. These patterns are consistent in texture and depth, aligning with the original material of the ceramic. The patterns are symmetrical and reflect a traditional motif that is coherent with the style of the pottery, suggesting high-quality embossing work.",

      "question": "Are the expanded motifs on the dress proportionally consistent with the garment’s structure, and do they avoid unnatural stretching or breaking of fabric lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motifs on the dress are proportionally consistent with the garment's structure. The patterns follow the curves and form of the dress naturally, without showing signs of unnatural stretching or breaking of fabric lines. The colors and arrangement of the motifs are consistent with the traditional style, suggesting careful attention was paid to maintaining the integrity of the design.",

      "question": "Do the transformed bread and cucumber retain recognizable forms as food items while incorporating character features, without unnatural deformations or texture inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bread and cucumber are transformed into character-like forms but still retain their recognizable shapes as food items. The transformation incorporates character features without resulting in any unnatural deformations or texture inconsistencies. The appearance remains clear in terms of what they are, while adding a creative character element.",

      "question": "Are the boundaries of each postcard vignette cleanly separated from the original image without cutting off elements or introducing edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the postcard vignette is well-separated from the original image, with clean boundaries that do not cut off elements or introduce edge artifacts. The postcard is neatly integrated with a border that distinguishes it clearly, ensuring it looks natural and intentional within the context of the image.",

      "question": "Does the woman’s right hand (visible near the stove) have five fingers with natural proportions and positioning, and does it cast a shadow consistent with the light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand of the woman, visible near the stove, appears to have five fingers with natural proportions and positioning. The hand is anatomically correct and positioned naturally. However, due to the composition, it is difficult to discern if it casts a shadow consistently with the light source. Nevertheless, the depiction focuses on hand correctness rather than shadow analysis.",
