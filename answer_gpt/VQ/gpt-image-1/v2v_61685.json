      "question": "Do the simplified human figures and the background tent maintain their structural coherence without introducing unnatural geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases simplified human figures, aligning cartoonish features reflective of common design styles in artwork. World knowledge suggests that illustration often simplifies forms without losing coherence. The tent and railings are basic yet retain structural integrity, silhouetted clearly against the background. This demonstrates consistency with straightforward geometric styles common in digital illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors restricted only to blues, whites, and the man's green shirt, and do they appear natural without introducing any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B uses a limited selection—as observed through the prioritized use of blues, whites, and green. In design, restricted color schemes often aim for thematic consistency. Given the non-detailed illustration style, colors appear flat and uniform, which is natural for this visual language. This conveys a coherent aesthetic without unnecessary texture introduction.",

      "question": "Does the text 'SKATE FOR ALL' integrate seamlessly into the upper cloudy sky region without disrupting the natural appearance of the clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'SKATE FOR ALL' in Image B is strategically placed at the top within the cloudy sky area, commonly seen in promotional materials. The text does not overlay any cloud shapes directly, maintaining visibility and coherence. The illustration method naturally harmonizes texts with backgrounds for clarity, consistent with design norms in poster creation. Consequently, the text integration is smooth and undistracting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the human figures and skateboards maintained realistically, avoiding any distortion or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains proportionate renditions of human figures and skateboards within the boundaries of illustrative art. Using world knowledge, even simplified cartoons seek to keep recognizable proportions, essential for readability and relatability. The figures and skateboards are shaped to match human form reference points, eliminating distortion and functionally presenting realistic scaling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the skateboards and clothing been preserved without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B takes a minimalistic approach typical in stylized graphics, equating to reduced detail complexity. While finer details are simplified—for example, the pattern on clothing and skateboard wheels—they are still reflective of essential forms, eliminating texture inconsistencies. This design choice fits within the narrative of maintaining clarity over complexity, showcasing natural thematic consistency.",
