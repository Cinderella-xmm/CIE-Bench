      "question": "Does the transparent acrylic display case show no visible distortion, reflection anomalies, or refraction errors that affect the appearance of the McLaren?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the acrylic display case appears clear and transparent without any noticeable visual distortion, reflection anomalies, or refraction errors that could alter the appearance of the McLaren car inside. This conclusion is based on the visual representation of the glass surfaces, which maintains the intended design of the car without visible interference.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the polished chrome base aligned with the car's position and does it reflect light and surroundings naturally without appearing disconnected or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the visual analysis of Image B, the polished chrome base is aligned with the car's stance and position. It reflects the light and theoretically captures the ambient surroundings naturally, maintaining visual coherence and connection with the car. This is evidenced by the lack of visible distortion in the reflection on the base.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the carbon fiber textures confined to the interior walls of the display case and do they exhibit consistent, non-repeating patterns without visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carbon fiber textures are clearly visible on the interior walls of the display case, offering a consistent pattern that aligns with typical carbon fiber designs. The pattern doesn't appear to have any visual artifacts or unexpected repetitions, indicating a thoughtful application of texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature wrenches and screwdrivers proportionally accurate compared to the McLaren and positioned in a way that suggests intentional placement without floating or clipping through surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the set of miniature wrenches and screwdrivers are displayed on the interior wall of the case in a manner that suggests careful and intentional positioning. The tools are proportional to the McLaren, depicted as miniatures, and securely placed without any signs of floating or clipping issues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the laser-etched cityscape silhouette positioned at a consistent depth behind the car and display case, with no overlapping or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cityscape silhouette appears as an etched background feature, maintaining a consistent depth that does not interfere with the car or the display case's acrylic exterior. There are no overlapping or clipping issues observed, indicating a well-integrated design element.",
