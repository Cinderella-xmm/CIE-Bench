      "question": "Does the roof of the van in Panel 1 tilt upward at a plausible angle without distorting the side panels or creating visible seams or breaks in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the van's roof is drawn consistently with a slight tilt yet respects the proportions and angles typically seen in cartoon-style illustrations of vans. Analyzing the shape and alignment of the roof in relation to the body, there are no visible seams or breaks in the structure, maintaining cohesion throughout the vehicle's depiction. Therefore, the roof tilt does not create implausibility or distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cactus in Panel 2 transformed into a spout with continuous curves and matching texture, and does it cast a shadow consistent with the light source direction seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus is creatively transformed into a water spout. The curves of the spout flow smoothly and the textures retain a cohesive style akin to the original cacti textures. Furthermore, the shadow follows a logical direction with respect to an assumed light source from the top left, consistent with established shadow patterns in cartoon settings.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the newly added plants around the oasis in Panel 3 rendered with the same level of detail and color harmony as the original cacti, and do they cast shadows that align with the scene’s lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 3 of Image B, the additional plants near the oasis are drawn with a similar cartoonish detail and color palette to the existing cacti, suggesting attention to consistency in color harmony across the image. The shadows cast by these plants align with the general lighting direction demonstrated in the rest of the scene, maintaining a coherent environment.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the text bubbles in all three panels positioned so they do not overlap critical parts of the van or landscape, and do they use a font style and size that matches the handwritten \"Road Trip\" title?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, text bubbles are placed strategically so as not to cover key features or elements of the van or landscape, ensuring visibility and comprehension of the scene. Although the font style in the speech bubbles is readable and clear, it does not match the handwritten 'Road Trip' title's cursive and artistic style, but rather appears simpler and more comic-like.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the water splashes in Panel 3 show droplets with varied sizes and arcing paths, and do they appear to originate from the van’s side without floating unnaturally above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water splashes demonstrate a range of sizes and follow arcing paths indicative of movement, typical of cartoon depictions of water splashes. The splashes visually start from the van’s side and trajectory towards the ground beneath, adhering to a natural arc and not appearing out of place or directionless.",

      "question": "Are the headlights in Panel 2 enlarged and brightened but still contained within the original housing, and do they retain their round shape without stretching or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headlights are depicted to be slightly enlarged and brightened, giving an enhanced cartoon effect while keeping within their original positioning in the van's structure. They maintain their circular form without excessive distortion, stretching, or going beyond the headlight housing.",
