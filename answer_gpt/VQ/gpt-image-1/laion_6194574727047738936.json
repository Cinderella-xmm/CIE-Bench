    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features and tiny hands added to each cereal bar proportionally sized and positioned in a way that maintains the original rectangular shape of the bars without distorting their geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cereal bars are designed with cartoon-style facial features and tiny hands. These elements are proportionally small and are placed centrally on each bar, preserving the bars' rectangular shape and not affecting their overall geometry. In cartoon art, facial features are typically oversized in relation to the body, but here they are appropriately sized to maintain the bar's structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cereal bar characters appear to interact with the pink flamingo mug in a physically plausible manner, such as touching or leaning toward it, without violating spatial logic or causing visual inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one of the cereal bars is situated close to the pink flamingo mug. Its arm is extended toward the flamingo handle, suggesting a gesture of interaction. The placement and orientation of the arms and bars do not show any spatial inconsistencies or implausible actions; thus, the interaction seems physically plausible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the whimsical font placed above the cereal bar characters clearly legible, properly aligned, and free from artifacts such as jagged edges or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The font in Image B is large, cartoonish, and prominently displayed above the cereal bar characters. It is clear and legible, with smooth edges and no visible artifacts like jagged lines or blurring, ensuring that it is easy to read and visually appealing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the added facial features and hands on the cereal bars preserve the original texture of the chocolate and cereal layers, without introducing unnatural smoothness, sharp edges, or missing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features and hands in Image B are designed to match the cartoon style of the image, which naturally differs from the real texture of the chocolate and cereal layers. However, their integration does not remove or obscure the original textures drastically; instead, they are layered over the top in a simple, stylized manner characteristic of cartoons, preserving the intended appearance without unnecessary smoothness or sharpness.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tiny hands added to the cereal bars have a natural number of fingers (no more than five), proper curvature, and appropriate shadowing to match the lighting in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tiny hands in Image B are simple and cartoonish, generally depicted with four fingers, which is common in cartoon art. They have a simplistic curvature that fits the style and follow the lighting and shadowing of the scene adequately, maintaining consistency with the overall image aesthetic.",
