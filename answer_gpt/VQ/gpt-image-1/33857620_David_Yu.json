      "question": "Does the transformed roof retain its triangular silhouette with smooth, continuous edges and display detailed icy etchings that appear integrated into the surface rather than overlaid or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembling a roof has transformed into a structure with smooth, continuous edges that retain a triangular silhouette, resembling a shell or carapace. The surface is adorned with icy patterns that appear integrated rather than overlayed, suggesting finesse and cohesion in the design. This observation aligns with the common depiction of fantasy structures where surface details enhance rather than detract from the form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the snow-covered areas transformed into wing-like forms that exhibit consistent translucency, subtle internal light diffusion, and seamless integration with the surrounding terrain without visible seams or unnatural brightness gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings have replaced the snow-covered areas. These wings possess consistent translucency, showing subtle light diffusion through their structure which looks natural in the setting. The integration with the terrain appears seamless, without any visible seams or unnatural brightness gradients, indicative of a well-crafted transformation in line with fantastical portrayals where such elements blend harmoniously with their environment.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the rocky outcrops in the foreground and midground form leg-like structures with anatomically plausible proportions, smooth transitions between segments, and moss textures that match the surrounding environment without appearing pasted or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rocky outcrops in the edited image have transformed into plausible leg-like structures that exhibit anatomically plausible proportions and smooth transitions between segments. The legs are textured with moss that appears natural and consistent with the surrounding environment, implying coherence without signs of being pasted or distorted, as might be expected in high-quality fantasy imagery.",

      "question": "Does the stream display a uniform, low-intensity glow along its entire length that follows the natural flow path, without sudden bright spots, broken lines, or inconsistent illumination patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stream exhibits a consistent low-intensity glow that smoothly follows the natural flow path. There are no sudden bright spots, broken lines, or inconsistent illumination patterns, which usually signify a transition from an ordinary stream to a fantasy-themed element with intrinsic mystical qualities.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the fog layer distributed evenly across the upper mountain regions and seamlessly blended with the sky and terrain, preserving depth cues and avoiding abrupt transitions or unnatural cloud formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fog layer appears evenly spread across the upper mountain regions. It blends seamlessly with both the sky and terrain, preserving depth cues essential for natural scenery representation. There are no abrupt transitions or unnatural cloud formations, maintaining the authenticity of the environment and continuity from the original image.",
