      "question": "Does the gold spoon maintain the same structural coherence as the original fork with no unnatural texture or distortion in the handle and bowl area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Initially examining Image B, the gold spoon displays realistic textural coherence on both the handle and the bowl area. The detailing and engravings along the handle and the curvature of the bowl are well-defined, indicating skillful craftsmanship. In comparison, Image A depicts a fork with a smooth surface, consistent with standard cutlery design. Both images maintain natural textures and an undistorted structural appearance, suggesting that the spoon in Image B is as coherent as the fork in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the interaction between the gold spoon and the napkin appear natural without disrupting the napkinâ€™s texture or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spoon rests on the napkin with a gentle curve, without any visible distortion or abnormal interaction. The napkin maintains its smoothness and natural folds, while shadows align logically with the positioning of the spoon. Comparing this with Image A, where the fork lays on the napkin also without disturbance to texture or shadows, both images exhibit a well-integrated interaction between the cutlery and the fabric.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the patterns on the gold spoon integrate naturally with the scene and appear as part of the spoon rather than a separate overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the patterns along the spoon's handle appear deeply carved and well-embedded, matching the spoon's material and design fluidly. This integration creates a sense of authenticity rather than appearing as an artificial overlay. Although Image A does not feature decorative patterns, both utensils exhibit a natural integration into their respective scenes, devoid of any overlay-like inconsistencies.",

      "question": "Does the gold spoon exhibit realistic reflectivity and shine consistent with a metallic spoon under the lighting conditions of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the gold spoon displays realistic reflectivity and shine attributes typical of metallic objects. Its lustrous surface reflects light naturally, indicating proper interaction with the ambient lighting, similar to the silvery surface of the fork in Image A. Both images capture the essential gleam of metal under direct lighting, maintaining consistency with real-world physical properties.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the size and positioning of the gold spoon proportionate and physically logical in relation to the napkin, avoiding any unusual scaling issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold spoon is positioned centrally along the napkin's fold, exhibiting proportionate scaling that aligns with common cutlery dimensions relative to the napkin. It mirrors the proper placement and size logic found in Image A with the fork. Both utensils maintain realistic scaling, ensuring that neither appears overly large or small within their context.",
