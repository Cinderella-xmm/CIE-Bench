    "Question": "Q1: Does the dancer's silhouette retain natural body proportions and smooth contours without distorted limbs or misshapen joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's silhouette is stylized and simplified intentionally, as it appears to be an artistic representation rather than a realistic depiction. The proportions adhere to the aesthetic style typical of illustrations, where emphasis is placed on flow and form rather than anatomical precision. The limbs appear proportionate to each other according to the artistic style of the image. Therefore, while not anatomically accurate in a realistic sense, the proportions are consistent within the artistic context.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the ruffles of the red dress transformed into flame-like swirls with smooth gradients and consistent lighting, avoiding jagged edges or disjointed shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ruffles of the dancer's dress are stylistically represented as flame-like swirls. The lines and patterns have been simplified to create a flowing and dynamic effect typical of an artistic illustration. The gradients are smooth, and the swirls are harmonious without jagged or disjointed transitions. This maintains a consistent visual style and emphasizes the movement and energy of the dance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the golden crescent moon reflection on the ground aligned with the position of the moon in the sky and does it follow realistic light reflection patterns on the tiled surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration style doesn't focus on accurate light and shadow physics. The moon in the sky doesn’t have a corresponding reflection on the ground; rather, there's an abstract swirling pattern suggesting light interaction, typical of a stylized depiction instead of a realistic scene. Given the artistic focus, the image is not intended for realism, hence the lack of realistic reflection.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the starry night sky border blend seamlessly with the main sky background without visible edges, repeated patterns, or unnatural star clustering?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the starry sky illustration appears to be purposefully designed with a uniform distribution of stars, avoiding visible edges or a repetitive pattern. The representation maintains a coherent and seamless blend, as is typical in illustrations, to create a visually appealing background without emphasizing individual elements like repetitive clusters that can detract from the overall composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the dancer’s raised hand show five clearly defined fingers with natural joint angles and no missing or extra digits?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's hand is stylized in silhouette form, which reduces anatomical details as part of its simplified artistic representation. The silhouette does not distinctly display individual fingers or their natural joint angles, focusing instead on general form and movement consistency. In artistic contexts, such complete realism is often sacrificed for stylistic coherence.",
    "answer": "No"
