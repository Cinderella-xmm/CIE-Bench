      "question": "Is the head of the pig significantly larger than the body without causing visible distortions in the neck or shoulder area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig's head does appear large in relation to its body, which is a characteristic of cartoon or chibi style illustration. This style often exaggerates head size while keeping other body proportions consistent, thus avoiding distortions in the neck or shoulder areas. The pig maintains a natural look in the context of this art style, with smooth transitions between the head and shoulder without visible distortion.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunglasses in Image B are designed in a simple cartoon style, with consistent coloring and reflective properties that match the whimsical, bright art style of the image.

      "question": "Do the pig's hands on the turntable have five fingers each, with natural finger spacing and curvature that match typical animal anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig's hands are simplified and cartoonized, aligning with typical cartoon representations where detailed anatomy is often altered for stylistic effect. The pig's hands are not detailed to have five fingers, which is common in cartoon illustrations, where realistic anatomy is adjusted to fit the character design.",
