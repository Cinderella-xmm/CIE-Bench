      "question": "Do the simplified versions of the red motorcycle and blue truck maintain their key features without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the motorcycle and truck retain their recognizable key features. The design simplifies their forms, using solid colors and flat shapes without textures, which is common in chibi-style illustrations. These elements are clear and maintain their identity. Compared to Image A, which depicts the motorcycle and truck in realistic detail, Image B abstracts these elements effectively, preserving key features and avoiding unnatural distortions.",

      "question": "Does the rider's black gear retain its essential characteristics without unnatural alterations or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the rider's black gear simplified into smooth, bounded shapes typical of chibi art, maintaining recognizable elements such as the helmet and overall outfit. There are no unnatural alterations as the gear is abstractly represented and simplified in a style-fitting manner, consistent with chibi design principles. This contrasts with Image A, where realistic textures and details are evident, but the abstract representation in Image B remains faithful without distorting essential characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the playful touches such as exaggerated proportions or expressive characteristics added without breaking the visual credibility or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, exaggerated proportions like the rider's simplified body and the vehicle shapes follow the chibi style, enhancing expressiveness without losing credibility or introducing artifacts. The elements remain coherent and visually pleasing, adhering to chibi design norms where exaggerated features emphasize character while maintaining visual integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the thick white outline applied consistently around the sticker design without interfering with the clarity of the elements within?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a thick white outline that neatly frames the entire design, enhancing the sticker's distinctiveness from the background without affecting the clarity of internal elements. This technique is consistent across the sticker, typical in cartoon-style illustrations to separate the subject from the background, ensuring it doesn't obstruct any internal feature. This approach maintains clarity while adding a deliberate stylistic effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the use of a solid flat color for the circular base, with the motorcycle or truck extending beyond it, achieve a dynamic effect without causing visual inconsistencies or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a solid flat color for the circular base, allowing elements like the motorcycle and truck to extend beyond it, creating a dynamic visual effect characteristic of sticker and badge designs. This enhances visual interest without introducing inconsistencies or loss of essential details, as the design balances simplicity with coherence. Although fine details are simplified compared to Image A, the style achieves the intended dynamic without compromising clarity or recognizability.",
