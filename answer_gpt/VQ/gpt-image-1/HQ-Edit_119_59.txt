    "Question": "Q1: Do the exaggerated arms maintain anatomical plausibility with visible muscle groups that follow natural contours and joint alignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arms are depicted in a cartoon style, which inherently involves exaggeration, especially in muscle size and shape. However, even with the exaggerated style, the general positioning of the arms and representation of muscle groups appear coherent with typical anatomical structures as interpreted in cartoon illustrations. The muscles are stylized yet recognizably patterned after human arm anatomy, maintaining joint alignment in the simplistic representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the gym-themed motifs on the tank top and shorts clearly rendered with consistent material properties and no overlapping or fragmented textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motifs on the tank top and shorts are distinct and cleanly drawn with cartoonish detailing. There is no visible overlapping or fragmentation of textures, and they are consistent with the rest of the image’s illustrative style, maintaining a uniform depiction of material properties.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the colorful icons positioned symmetrically on both sides of the barbell and aligned with the bar’s axis without appearing detached or distorted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the icons surrounding the main figure are placed in a way that complements the cartoon aesthetic, with approximate symmetry and alignment to enhance visual balance. The placement and orientation are coherent with the theme, appearing well-integrated and undistorted within the design space, respecting the barbell’s axis near them.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Do the shadow illustrations in the mirror maintain consistent lighting direction and depth relative to the main subject and surrounding objects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shadow illustrations are not applicable because this image relies on 2D cartoon characteristics rather than 3D or realistic depictions present in Image A. Therefore, the concept of mirror depth and lighting consistency does not apply to the animated style.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the calendar strip aligned horizontally along the bottom edge of the panel and sized appropriately to match the scale of the figure and surroundings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar strip is precisely aligned along the bottom edge of the panel, providing a clear and structurally sound conclusion to the image layout. The horizontal alignment offers a sense of order, and its proportion relative to the figure and surrounding elements is visually acceptable within the cartoon style, maintaining balance with the humorously exaggerated features above.",
    "answer": "Yes"
