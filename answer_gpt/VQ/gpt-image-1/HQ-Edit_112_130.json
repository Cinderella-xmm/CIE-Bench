    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the brocade gown have natural-looking folds and volume in the puffy sleeves and skirt, with no stretched or flattened areas that contradict fabric behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (second image) shows a gown with intricate brocade fabric. The sleeves and skirt exhibit realistic folds and volume that align with how fabric naturally behaves, particularly with a heavy brocade weave that offers structure which allows for pronounced contours. There are no apparent areas that look stretched or flattened unnaturally, which indicates an understanding of fabric behavior by the artist.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the rose blossoms evenly distributed along the branches with natural petal shapes and color variation, and do they align with the direction of light without appearing pasted or duplicated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image has roses that seem to be evenly distributed along the depicted branches, with petals showing varied coloration typical of natural roses. Their shapes are consistent with naturally blooming roses, and the lighting direction corresponds with the surrounding light environment, reducing the likelihood of them appearing artificially pasted or duplicated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues have consistent line work, proper shadowing, and spatial alignment with the ground plane and surrounding trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the edited image, the gazebos and statues possess line work that appears uniformly detailed, with shadows rendered to match the lighting source. They are positioned in accordance with the spatial layout of the ground and trees, showing coherent alignment, suggesting careful consideration of proportion and perspective.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the left hand have five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and does the right hand grip the bow in a physically plausible manner without extra digits or distorted joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image's depiction of hands shows fingers with appropriate spacing and curvature on the left hand, where five fingers are evident. The grip on the bow by the right hand is depicted in a manner consistent with holding an object, without noticeable anatomical errors such as extra digits or unnatural joint distortion.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brocade patterns on the gown, the metal mesh of the gazebo, and the stone texture of the statues free from repeating tiles, pixelation, or unnatural smoothness that suggests low-resolution generation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brocade patterns on the gown, as well as the textures on the gazebos and statues, exhibit varied and intricate designs without visible signs of repeating tiles or pixelation. This suggests a high-resolution generation or careful manual artistry, as opposed to any texture errors like unnatural smoothness typically seen in low-resolution composites.",
