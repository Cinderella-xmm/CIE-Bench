      "question": "Do the transformed trunk sections into arms and legs follow natural joint-like curves and avoid sharp, unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the maple leaf characters have limbs that resemble human arms and legs. These limbs are drawn with smooth curves, mimicking natural joint movements, rather than having sharp or unnatural angles. The limbs appear fluid and in motion, characteristic of a playful cartoon style which suggests natural articulation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leaf-shaped heads composed of intact maple leaves with visible veins and gradient coloring, and do the facial features (eyes, mouth) sit naturally on the surface without distorting the leaf shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each character’s head is a distinct maple leaf with sharp, clear outlines typical of a leaf shape. The coloring is solid, typical of a flat design without visible veins or gradients. The facial features are drawn onto the leaf shape without visibly altering or distorting the leaf itself, maintaining the integrity of the leaf's outline.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The accessories, such as the hat and scarf in Image B, follow the same flat and clean vector illustration style consistent with the maple leaf characters. They have solid colors and sharp edges without any texture artifacts. This uniform design style ensures a cohesive appearance without deviations in line quality or additional textures.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a consistent color palette that fits the autumn theme, using shades of orange, yellow, red, and brown. The limbs, facial features, and accessories all adhere to this palette without introducing any contrasting colors that do not fit the fall theme.",

      "question": "Do all anthropomorphized tree characters and their accessories lie completely within the brown rectangular border without extending outside its edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree characters and their accessories in Image B are contained entirely within the brown rectangular border. There is no extension of limbs, leaves, or accessories beyond the boundary, which keeps the illustration neat and cohesive within its frame.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text bubbles are positioned adjacent to the characters, avoiding any overlap with the characters’ limbs or leaves. The bubbles have consistent line thickness and a transparent fill that complements the flat design style of the illustration, ensuring they integrate well without disturbing the character elements.",
