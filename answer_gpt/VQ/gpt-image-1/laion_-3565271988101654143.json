      "question": "Do the holographic widgets and 3D elements on the smartphone screen appear seamlessly integrated with the device's surface, maintaining consistent depth cues and shadowing that match the phone's form factor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic widgets and 3D elements on the smartphone screen are presented with a futuristic and digital effect. They appear to be floating slightly above the screen, giving the impression of holographic technology. The visual effects such as shadowing and depth cues are consistent with this theme, making them appear as though they are integrated with, yet distinct from, the device's surface. This integration relies on maintaining appropriate size and shadow relative to the phone's dimensions, which is achieved well in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the forward-projection effect of the smartphone screen visually coherent, with no distortion of the phone’s frame or screen edges, and does it maintain proper spatial relationship with the hand holding it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the forward-projection effect gives the illusion that the smartphone screen is projecting data or holographic features outward. The image maintains the phone's frame and screen edges without visual distortion, and the projection seems to adhere to appropriate spatial relationships with the hand that holds it, maintaining a coherent perspective and proportionate size.",

      "question": "Does the biometric hand scanning overlay align precisely with the hand’s natural anatomy, showing accurate finger positions and skin texture, without introducing extra fingers or distorted proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The biometric hand scanning overlay in Image B is designed to register the hand's anatomy. The holographic overlay aligns with the position of fingers accurately, corresponding well with natural hand anatomy without any extra fingers or proportionate distortions. It mimics a futuristically scanned surface, implying an understanding of correct anatomical representation.",

      "question": "Is the futuristic skyline displayed on the laptop screen rendered with consistent geometry and perspective, and does it align naturally with the laptop’s bezel and keyboard without clipping or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The futuristic skyline on the laptop screen in Image B appears as a holographic display with high coherence in geometry and perspective. It aligns naturally with the laptop's edges and keyboard, showing no visible signs of clipping or misalignment, contributing to an immersive visual appearance consistent with its futurism theme.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the smartphone and laptop displays share consistent visual design elements (e.g., blue color palette, futuristic typography, and interface style) that create a cohesive technological narrative without conflicting styles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the smartphone and the laptop displays utilize a consistent visual style characterized by a blue color palette, futuristic typography, and similar interface elements. This harmony in design ensures a cohesive technological narrative, reinforcing the theme of advanced technology and synchronized aesthetic among the devices.",
