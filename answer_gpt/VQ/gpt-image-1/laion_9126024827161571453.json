      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the robot figures derived from the batteries have limbs and heads that are proportionally sized and attached in a way that maintains structural coherence with their original cylindrical form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot figures are designed to resemble humanoid forms. They have limbs and heads that are proportional to their bodies, which mimic the design elements of the batteries, such as the copper and black color palette. The cylindrical form of a battery is adapted into a torso for the robots, maintaining structural coherence from an artistic perspective while allowing for sufficient articulation and humanoid posture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the robot figures made from the batteries rendered with a consistent metallic texture that mimics copper and black materials without visible artifacts like checkerboard patterns or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot figures in Image B have surfaces that mimic the metallic texture of copper and black, similar to the recognizable design of Duracell batteries. There are no visible artifacts such as checkerboard patterns or unnatural reflections, indicating consistency in rendering the metallic texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the digital cityscape background positioned behind the robot figures with correct layering, atmospheric gradient, and light source alignment that matches the direction of illumination on the robots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cityscape background in Image B is layered behind the robot figures, creating a sense of depth and scale. The atmospheric gradient and lighting appear to be aligned correctly with the light source illuminating the robots, adding coherence to the scene. The light source direction and the illuminated areas on the robots suggest a consistent approach to lighting throughout the composition.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the digital screen displaying “10 Years in Storage” seamlessly integrated into the scene with readable text, smooth edges, and ambient lighting that matches the sci-fi theme without pixelation or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital screen is integrated into the scene with smooth edges and readable text. The ambient lighting matches the overall sci-fi theme, and there is no apparent pixelation or distortion. The incorporation of the digital screen is visually harmonious within the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title \"Duracell Guardians: Power Preserve Adventures!\" displayed in a clean, bold, futuristic font with uniform stroke width and no visual artifacts like jagged edges or overlapping glyphs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title in Image B is presented in a bold, futuristic font characteristic of sci-fi themes. The stroke width of the lettering is uniform, and there are no visual artifacts such as jagged edges or overlapping glyphs. The title is crisply rendered, enhancing its legibility and thematic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the robot figures, title, and digital screen arranged in a way that avoids overlapping text or important visual elements, ensuring all components are legible and distinct?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the robot figures, title, and digital screen is done in a way that avoids overlapping and ensures that all textual and visual components are distinct and legible. The composition respects the visual hierarchy needed to highlight each element effectively, allowing them to coexist without obstruction.",
