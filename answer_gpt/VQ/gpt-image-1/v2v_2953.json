      "question": "Does the claymation texture applied to the cocktail glass maintain its structural coherence without introducing unnatural textures or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays a cocktail glass with a claymation texture, characterized by simplified and smoother details typical of clay. The inherent properties of clay lead to a loss of fine details found in the original, realistic glass depiction. However, this is expected as claymation emphasizes stylized forms over intricate detail, which maintains structural coherence appropriate to the artistic style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ice cubes and liquid in the cocktail retain their visual plausibility and natural appearance after being converted into a claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows ice cubes and liquid rendered in claymation style, which presents them with simplified shapes and textures. While claymation inherently reduces realism, it is executed effectively here, creating recognizable ice cubes and liquid that fit within this artistic form, albeit without the translucence and reflections inherent in real ice and liquid.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the lime slice and straw preserved without distortion in the claymation design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the lime slice and straw are rendered with clear geometric shapes typical of claymation. The lime retains its circular shape and segmentation, and the straw maintains its straight form. These elements appear consistent with the stylized design without noticeable distortion, matching expectations for claymation art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background, including the bar counter and bottles, retain its structural integrity and visual coherence without introducing unnatural artifacts in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uses a claymation style for the background, including the bar counter and bottles. The visual coherence is maintained with recognizable bottle shapes and counter structure, albeit simplified and stylized as typical of clay animation. There are no unnatural artifacts, only simplified textures consistent with clay art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the cocktail glass, napkin, and surrounding objects logically consistent in the claymation design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image accurately reflects proportions and placements seen in the original image, despite the change in texture. The cocktail glass, napkin, and other elements adhere to realistic spatial relationships and proportions appropriate to the claymation style, without introducing inconsistencies or illogical arrangements.",
