      "question": "Does the front view of the apple maintain its original texture and color without any noticeable artifacts or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front view of the apple shows a realistic texture and a consistent red color typical of apples. The lighting highlights the natural variation in the skin, which includes subtle speckles and a glossy finish. This implies that the apple's original texture and color have been preserved, and there are no visible signs of digital artifacts or unnatural smoothing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the cross-section reveal a natural, detailed texture of the apple's flesh, avoiding any unnatural or overly smooth appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cross-section in Image B displays the apple's flesh with fine detail and natural texture. It shows a believable distribution of color and grain typical of a fresh apple. This suggests no signs of digital alteration or overly smooth processed areas. The appearance is consistent with a natural apple cut, indicating the preservation of its authentic texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the top view of the apple’s stem and calyx accurately represented with natural proportions and geometry, without any obvious distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top view of the apple reveals a well-proportioned stem and calyx area, showcasing rounded and symmetric features common in apples. The visual details, including the natural shadows and shapes of the stem and surrounding area, appear accurate without visible digital distortions or artifacts. This indicates a faithful representation of the apple’s physical properties.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shapes, sizes, and textures of the apple consistent across the front view, cross-section, and top view, ensuring structural coherence without any contradictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all views of the apple show consistent textures and proportional integrity across the front view, cross-section, and top view. The apple maintains a coherent shape, and the characteristics, like color and texture, align between the different sections. This coherence suggests no contradictions in structural representation among the views.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows in the cross-section and top view appear natural and consistent with those in the front view, contributing to a unified appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows are consistent across the different views of the apple. The direction and intensity of the light source create a uniform highlight effect and shadow placement in each section. This provides a realistic and unified visual appearance, consistent with natural lighting conditions.",
