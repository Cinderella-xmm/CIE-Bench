      "question": "Does the transition area between the painting and the wall maintain the natural texture of the wall material without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting extends seamlessly onto the wall without any visible frame, creating the effect of a mural. The transition from the painting to the surrounding wall seems smooth, and there are no visible artifacts or disruptions in the texture of the wall. This suggests a careful editing process that respects the natural appearance and texture of the wall, ensuring no noticeable discrepancies.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the trees and water in the painting maintained realistically without appearing stretched or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the trees and water maintains realistic proportions. The trees have consistent heights and widths, and the water smoothly transitions into the background, preserving a natural perspective. The absence of visible distortion or stretching suggests an accurate rendering of proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the shadows and lighting in the painting align consistently with the room's light source, avoiding unnatural contrasts or disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting within the painting in Image B appears harmonious with the room's lighting, with the sun depicted in the painting casting a warm glow that aligns with the ambient light entering from the right. The shadows and highlights within the painting do not exhibit any noticeable contrast with the real room's light, indicating a cohesive light environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the painting preserve its depth and layering, creating a believable 3D effect without disrupting its visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting exhibits depth and layering, with the trees and water arranged in a manner that creates perspective and spacing. This layering effect helps in achieving a 3D appearance, where the viewer can perceive both the foreground and background clearly. The coherence and execution suggest a successful creation of depth without disruption.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the frame around the painting retain its structural integrity and material appearance without visible damage or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a traditional frame as seen in Image A. Instead, the painting is seamlessly integrated into the wall as if it were a mural. Therefore, there is no frame to assess for structural integrity or material appearance, so the concern about frame damage or texture does not apply in this context.",
