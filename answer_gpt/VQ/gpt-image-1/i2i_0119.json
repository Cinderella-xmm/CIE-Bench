      "question": "Does the keychain version of the character maintain the same proportions and colors as the original image, without any visible distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When examining Image B, it is clear that the character on the keychain has consistent proportions compared to what you would expect from the design in Image A. The colors are vibrant and match well with the original illustration's palette. The textures appear smooth and appropriate for a keychain material, lending it a cartoon-like charm without distortion, which aligns with the visual representation from Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the keychain appear naturally placed on the desk with appropriate shadows and reflections, indicating a realistic interaction with the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadow effects underneath the keychain are well-executed, mimicking a realistic drop-shadow effect you would expect from an object on a flat surface. The reflection and light interactions are consistent with general real-world scenarios, indicating the keychain sits naturally on the desk without appearing digitally imposed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the books and glasses placed next to the keychain rendered with realistic textures and a consistent level of detail, without any obvious artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, both the books and glasses are rendered with clear textures depicting realistic materialsâ€”books showing the thickness of pages, and glasses exhibiting shine that corresponds to typical plastic or metal textures. The level of detail remains consistent across all objects in the scene, with no apparent artifacts or loss of realism.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the keychain and its neighboring objects (books, glasses, desk) crisp and well-defined, with no signs of blending or breaking apart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows objects with sharp, well-defined borders. The edges of the keychain, books, and glasses are delineated smoothly, making each item visually distinct without signs of unintended blending or pixelation. This indicates high-quality rendering typical of real-world scenes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the books and glasses exhibit proper orientation and placement on the desk, reflecting typical real-world scenarios where they would be found?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of both the books and glasses resembles typical office or study desk setups. The books are stacked neatly to the side of the keychain, and the glasses sit in a typical arrangement, suggesting they were casually placed. This reflects usual desk organization patterns and contributes to the realism of the scene.",
