      "question": "Are the elements of the image, such as the elephant and its environment, unaltered and maintain their original natural appearance without any artifacts introduced in the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a meticulously arranged dish elegantly presented with a spiral cut of meat, fan-shaped slices of carrot, green dots (likely peas), and a row of sauce droplets. The visual and environmental elements, such as an elephant and its surroundings, are not present in Image B. Thus, Image B does not retain the original natural appearance related to an elephant or its environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the elements within the image appear natural and consistent with the original, such as the roughness of the elephantâ€™s skin and the details of the hay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a food presentation focusing on culinary elements rather than natural wildlife, which excludes the roughness inherent to an elephant's skin or details akin to hay. The textures in Image B are glossy and precise, suitable for culinary items, distinct from natural textures of an elephant or hay.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical features of the elephant and its surroundings, like the hay bale and enclosure, depicted accurately and without unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is entirely focused on culinary presentation with no elements related to elephants, hay bales, or enclosures. Therefore, there are no features of an elephant or related surroundings from Image A to analyze for accuracy or distortion in Image B.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details, such as the subtle lines and wrinkles on the elephant's skin and the strands of hay, been preserved without any degradation or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the photo of a food dish contains no elements depicting an elephant or hay. The fine details pertain to the textures of food presentation rather than the natural textures of an elephant's skin or hay, meaning these aspects have not been preserved or altered by degradation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition of the image, including the placement of the elephant, the hay bale, and the enclosure, maintain visual credibility and alignment with the expected scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is composed of a plate with food elegantly arranged for artistic and culinary appeal, which differs from a natural outdoor scene with an elephant and its environment. Hence, it does not involve elements such as an elephant or hay bale, nor does it maintain alignment with such a setting.",
