      "question": "Are the stylized seating icons positioned on the grass without overlapping or displacing real people or objects, and do they cast consistent shadows matching the sun's direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized seating icons are located on the grass area. These icons are silhouette-style illustrations and do not interfere with any real people or objects because the image itself is an artistic representation rather than a photograph. The icons do not cast shadows, as the image's style does not incorporate realistic shadow casting for elements, and the sun icon is simply a graphic overlay. Based on this illustration style and consistency with image composition, the requirement for shadows is not applicable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the speech bubble graphics appear above or near walking figures without intersecting limbs or clothing, and are they proportionally sized relative to the human figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is designed with a simplistic and symbolic approach, where human figures are represented as minimalist icons with a speech bubble graphic nearby one pair of walking figures. The speech bubble is placed above them, not interfering with their limbs or clothing because these are stylized graphic icons without intricate details. The proportional size of the speech bubble is appropriate given the simplified graphic representation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the camera icon featuring the Eiffel Tower correctly scaled and positioned so that its outline matches the tower's silhouette and does not exhibit distortion or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The camera icon in Image B is a graphic symbol featuring the silhouette of the Eiffel Tower within it. The icon is positioned in a way to highlight its symbolic meaning rather than spatial accuracy. There are no distortions or edge artifacts because the entire image is a uniform, stylized, and simplified depiction of the scene with consistent graphic design principles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the vertical split line align with the center of the pathway and extend consistently from foreground to background without cutting through key structures like the Eiffel Tower or hedges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the graphic representation in Image B, there is an implied pathway split by the way the icons and text are arranged. However, no explicit vertical line is present, given the simplified design. The organization keeps the Eiffel Tower and hedges intact, with symbolic structures and icons not interfering with each other, aligning conceptually rather than literally splitting the scene.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cool green tones applied uniformly across the image without causing visible color banding, loss of detail in shadows, or unnatural saturation in the sky or leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a monochrome, cool green palette applied uniformly to the entire illustration, maintaining a consistent style across the image without visible color banding or loss of detail. As a stylized illustration, shadows or detailed textures are not depicted, avoiding concerns of natural saturation or detail capturing in realistic sense.",
