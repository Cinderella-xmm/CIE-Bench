    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) positioned on the dial such that they do not obscure the numerals or subdials, and do they blend with the metallic texture without introducing unnatural shading or edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays an anthropomorphized wristwatch with facial features like eyes and a mouth. These features are positioned in the central area of the dial, ensuring they do not interfere with viewing the numerals or subdials. Also, the artwork blends seamlessly with the rest of the watch face, maintaining the comic style without introducing any awkward shading or unnatural edges. This indicates a successful integration of these features, preserving the clarity of the original dial's components.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the detective desk and magnifying glass proportionally sized relative to the watch, and are they rendered with consistent line weight and shading that matches the comic style without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The detective desk and magnifying glass in Image B are drawn to be proportionate to the anthropomorphized watch, fitting well within the comic's stylized setting. The illustration utilizes consistent line weight and shading, typical of comic illustrations, ensuring there are no geometric distortions. As a result, these elements harmoniously blend with the overall art style, preserving coherence and congruence in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the background elements (cluttered office items) appear spatially coherent with the watch, showing correct layering and perspective without overlapping or clipping through the watch's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B includes cluttered office items that are integrated into the scene with proper layering and perspective. The office items are drawn in such a way that they do not overlap or interfere with the boundary of the watch character. The elements sit comfortably in the background, adding depth to the scene while maintaining spatial coherence with the main subject of the illustration.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tick mark sound effects uniformly shaped and cleanly rendered around the dial, without jagged edges, smudging, or inconsistent spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'tick' sound effects are added around the watch character to enhance the comic expression. These sound effects are cleanly rendered, maintaining uniform shapes. The spacing is consistent, and the effects are free from any jagged edges or smudging, contributing to the clarity and aesthetic appeal of the overall design. This harmonizes with the illustration, ensuring readability and artistic cohesion.",

      "question": "Does the stylized version retain the original texture of the black leather strap and the brushed silver finish of the case, with no visible texture warping or color inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stylized version in Image B has adapted details like the black leather strap and the brushed silver finish of the case. Despite the addition of cartoonish elements, these textures are preserved without apparent warping or color inconsistencies. The artist maintained the reflective characteristics of the metal and the texture of the leather, ensuring that the cartoon style does not detract from the material's essence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features do not obstruct the key components of the watch, such as the hour and minute hands, the subdials, and the date window. These elements are retained in their original positions and proportions, ensuring that the functionality and design of the watch remain clearly visible and unaltered by additional elements.",
