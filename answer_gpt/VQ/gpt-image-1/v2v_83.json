      "question": "Does the skateboard maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility after being rendered in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is depicted with a consistent shape and recognizable features such as the deck, wheels, and trucks. The cartoon style rendering enhances its appearance but does not distort its fundamental structure. By comparing both images, the essential characteristics remain the same, thereby maintaining visual credibility.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's clothing retains its recognizable forms and textures, such as the jacket's hemline, sleeve, and collar. The 3D cartoon style emphasizes these elements with smoothness and clarity without introducing visual artifacts.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the skater in a pose that appears balanced and confident, consistent with typical character designs in 3D cartoons. The proportions of the arms, torso, and legs are stylized yet remain natural within the cartoon aesthetic, avoiding distortion.",
