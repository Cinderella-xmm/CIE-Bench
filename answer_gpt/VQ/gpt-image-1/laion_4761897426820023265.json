      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edge of the snow globe smooth and continuous, with no visible seams, distortions, or pixelation along its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues of the snow globe in Image B show a smooth and continuous edge, typical of glass or clear plastic spheres. The absence of seams or pixelation is evident from the uniform curve and clarity of the globe surface as it encapsulates the scene. The knowledge of how glass or clear plastics generally appear aids in recognizing the smoothness and continuity of the globe's surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the reflections and refractions on the snow globe surface consistent with how light behaves on clear glass, showing subtle bending of the scene behind it and soft highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe exhibits realistic light behavior, with light reflections and refractions that mimic clear glass. The scene inside and behind the globe shows slight distortions, characteristic of refractions on curved glass surfaces. This effect is observed through bending lines and soft highlights on the globe's surface, consistent with expectations for glass.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all visible figures inside the snow globe have complete and correctly proportioned limbs, with no extra fingers, missing arms, or distorted postures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures inside the snow globe in Image B appear to be miniatures of people walking along the Great Wall. The limbs are proportionate and there are no visible anomalies such as extra fingers or missing arms. This conclusion is drawn from the detailed observation of each figure's posture and limb arrangement within the scene, which appears anatomically correct.",

      "question": "Are the autumn-colored leaves integrated smoothly into the existing green vegetation, with no abrupt color changes or blocky textures indicating digital overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a scene where autumn-colored leaves blend naturally into the green vegetation around the Great Wall. There are smooth transitions in color, and the textures maintain a realistic appearance without evident blocky or abrupt changes. This seamless integration is consistent with realistic depictions of foliage transitioning between seasons.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the snow particles visible throughout the globe in a dynamic, swirling pattern, and do they not fully cover the Great Wall or figures, allowing them to remain clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow particles inside the globe are dispersed in a manner resembling the swirling dynamics typical of snow globes. The particles do not obstruct the view of the Great Wall or the figures within, allowing these elements to remain distinctly visible, consistent with a well-designed snow globe that maintains clarity of the interior scene while adding a dynamic element.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the ceramic birds clearly distinguishable as small flying objects with defined wings and bodies, and are they located in the air above the Wall without touching any surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ceramic birds in Image B are styled accurately with defined wings and bodies, positioned in the air above the Great Wall. They are clearly distinguishable and do not touch any other surfaces within the globe. The visual cues confirm their placement in the sky, consistent with decorative elements intended to create a sense of open space and flight.",

      "question": "Is the wooden base dark in color, textured with realistic grain, and does it support the snow globe without floating or tilting, with the engraved text clearly legible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base of the snow globe in Image B appears dark and features a realistic wood grain texture. It is supporting the snow globe steadily without any indication of floating or tilting. The engraved text 'Great Wall Memories' is legibly displayed on the base, which matches the common presentation of keepsake snow globes.",
