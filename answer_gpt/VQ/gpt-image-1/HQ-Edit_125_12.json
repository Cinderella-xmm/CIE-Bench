      "question": "Does the marble texture beneath the teapot exhibit natural veining and color variation without abrupt edges or artificial patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the teapot appears smooth with a subtle color variation characteristic of marble. The veining pattern is gentle and flowing, which is typical of natural marble. There are no visible abrupt edges or artificial patterns that disrupt the realistic appearance of the marble, which indicates the texture is consistent with genuine marble. Thus, the marble texture exhibits natural veining and color variation.",

      "question": "Is the transparent label positioned on the teapotâ€™s body with uniform opacity and no visible pixelation or ghosting around the text edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label on Image B appears clear with consistent opacity. The text on the label is sharp without any visible pixelation or ghosting, suggesting a clean application of the label on the teapot's body. The edges around the text are smooth, maintaining a professional finish, which indicates proper placement and design of the label.",

      "question": "Does the gold monogram on the lid align with the surrounding engravings in terms of depth, shadow, and metallic finish, without appearing raised or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold monogram on the lid is integrated well with the surrounding engravings. The depth, shadow, and metallic finish of both the monogram and engravings are consistent, giving the impression that they are part of the same object and design. The monogram does not appear raised or detached from the lid, maintaining the continuity of the metallic finish.",

      "question": "Is the box positioned adjacent to the teapot with correct perspective and scale, and does it feature consistent engraving patterns and material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box is positioned next to the teapot, and the perspective reflects a natural alignment relative to the teapot. The scale of the box appears proportionate to the teapot, which is essential for a realistic scene. The box features engraving patterns and a material appearance similar to those on the teapot, indicating consistency in design and material choice.",

      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the teapot and box consistent with the light source direction and do they match the ambient lighting of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, shadows are cast in a direction consistent with the light source, as evidenced by the lighting on the teapot and box. The ambient lighting in the scene suits the placement and length of the shadows, indicating a well-coordinated lighting design within the image.",
