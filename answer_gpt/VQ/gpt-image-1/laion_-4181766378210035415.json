    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all LEGO bricks forming the bed frame, mattress, and base properly aligned and interlocked without visible gaps or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks appear to be properly aligned and interlocked without noticeable gaps or misalignments. This conclusion is based on the visual cues, such as the straight lines and the even surface created by the bricks. These alignments are consistent with the common knowledge of how LEGO structures are typically constructed to create a cohesive build.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the light blue floral pattern on the duvet appear consistent with the original design, with no missing or incorrectly placed colored bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light blue floral pattern on the duvet is rendered in a way that matches the design seen in typical LEGO applications. By observing the placement and the pattern's continuity, it appears consistent with a coherent design process, ensuring no parts are missing or misaligned.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the curved shape of the new headboard composed of LEGO-style elements that follow realistic LEGO curvature without appearing stretched or deformed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the headboard is composed of flat LEGO bricks without any evident curvature. Instead, bricks follow straight lines typical of LEGO constructions, and there's no visual indication of stretching or deformation in the design. This use of LEGO elements aligns with the realistic constraints of its construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pillows formed by stacked LEGO bricks showing a natural three-dimensional shape with appropriate layering and no floating or disconnected pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pillows in Image B are assembled from layered LEGO bricks, which are aligned and interconnected to form a coherent three-dimensional structure. This layering mirrors how objects are built using LEGO, creating the appearance of a substantial shape with no visible floating or detached pieces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the LEGO bed match the lighting direction and softness of the original image, with no unnatural dark spots or over-bright areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows in Image B are consistent with the lighting angle observed in the scene, creating soft and harmonious shadowing without any harsh or unusual darkened or overly bright regions. This consistency indicates that the rendering of lighting and shadow is in alignment with typical soft lighting practices.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the proportions and positions of the pillows, duvet, and headboard consistent with the original bed, with no noticeable scaling errors or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing Image A and B, the proportions of the pillows, duvet, and headboard in Image B align with Image A's layout and proportions. By maintaining similar spatial relationships and scales, there are no noticeable mismatches in dimension or misplacement in the composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all LEGO bricks have a uniform matte finish with no unnatural glossiness, transparency, or pixelation that would suggest low-quality rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO bricks in Image B exhibit a consistent matte finish, typical of the LEGO material, with no areas of gloss, pixelation, or transparency that would deviate from high-quality rendering standards. This uniformity in finish suggests attention to detail in representing the LEGO materials authentically.",
