      "question": "Do the deep burgundy drapes hang naturally with smooth folds and consistent shadow gradients, and do they cast realistic shadows on the wall and floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The burgundy drapes are arranged in a way that they form smooth and aesthetically pleasing folds, which is typical to see in luxurious fabric arrangements. The shadows cast by the drapes on the wall and floor appear consistent with the lighting from the ceiling fixture, creating natural-looking gradients without any abrupt changes, suggesting a good quality manipulation of shadows.",

      "question": "Are the gold woodwork details on the bed frame continuous, symmetrical, and free from warped or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold woodwork details on the canopy bed frame show symmetry and continuity, maintaining a consistent design pattern across its structure. There are no apparent visual distortions or broken geometric shapes in the design, ensuring the aesthetic and structural integrity of the woodwork.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cherub images on the pillows show visible brushstroke texture, subtle color gradients, and seamless integration into the pillow surface without sharp borders or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cherub images on the pillows feature a coherent integration into the surface of the pillow, displaying smooth transitions and a subtlety in color gradients, which minimizes sharp borders or pixelation. The presence of visible brushstroke texture further suggests a well-rendered artistic depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the new canopy drapes and gold woodwork match the direction of the ceiling light and fall consistently on adjacent walls and floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ceiling light suggests a central point of illumination, and the shadows cast by the canopy drapes and gold woodwork follow that direction accurately, creating consistent shadow cast patterns on the adjacent walls and floor. This implies a careful attention to the alignment and direction of lighting in relation to the structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the redesigned canopy bed fully contained within the room boundaries, with no parts extending beyond the ceiling or overlapping the wall, and does it maintain a realistic scale relative to the nightstand and rug?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The redesigned canopy bed is situated within the confines of the room, as evidenced by its placement relative to surrounding elements like the nightstand and rug. Its dimensions appear realistic when compared to these items, ensuring no elements of the bed overextend or interfere with room boundaries.",
