      "question": "Do the petal-like feathers on the sparrow’s body exhibit smooth transitions in pink gradient without visible pixelation, banding, or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow has been artistically transformed with petal-like feathers that present a smooth transition in pink shades. This visual transition demonstrates a seamless gradient in color, typically indicative of a well-rendered design, showcasing no pixelation or abrupt color shifts. Such enhancements imply careful editing to maintain natural aesthetics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blossom patterns on the wings aligned with the natural feather structure and do they avoid overlapping or warping of existing feather edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an artistically edited bird where the blossoms are positioned creatively on the wings. The blossoms are designed to align naturally with the feather's structure, carefully avoiding any overlap or distortion that would disrupt the feather's perceived form. This alignment suggests meticulous editing to integrate floral elements harmoniously without affecting the feather's integrity.",

      "question": "Does the cascading cherry blossom tail emerge naturally from the base of the original tail and follow a downward flow that matches the bird’s posture without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic design includes a tail composed of cascading cherry blossoms, emerging naturally from the bird's body and following a downward flow. This design aligns with the bird's orientation and gravity, ensuring it blends naturally without appearing to float or misaligned. Such alignment is crucial for maintaining the illusion of realism in a stylized image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the vines around the sparrow’s legs follow natural curvature and thickness proportional to the leg size, without penetrating or distorting the foot structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a bird adorned with vines. These vines wrap around the legs, carefully adhering to the natural curve of the limbs and maintaining proportions consistent with the leg size. Importantly, they avoid unrealistic penetration or distortion of the legs or feet, showcasing an attention to detail necessary for maintaining anatomical plausibility.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dewdrop ornaments on the chest positioned realistically on the surface of the feathers and do they reflect light consistently with surrounding lighting conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, dewdrop ornaments are skillfully placed along the bird's chest. These ornaments are positioned to sit naturally on the feather's surface and reflect light in harmony with the image's overall lighting conditions, suggesting a realistic integration of elements that complements the bird's enhanced design.",
