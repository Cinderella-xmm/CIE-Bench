      "question": "Does the 3D chibi version of the person in the foreground maintain the structural integrity of the suit and cup without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi version of the person retains the sleek and clean lines typical of a suit, with even the button detail distinctly visible, suggesting that the suit's structure is well-maintained. The cup appears smooth and proportionate, closely following the realistic depiction in Image A, indicating no unnatural textures or distortions. The suit and cup in 3D imagery are rendered to look cohesive, maintaining their integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 3D chibi version of the person in the background retain the natural appearance of the suit and the warm glow of the lamp without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi version maintains the suit's dark color and characteristic form fidelity, replicating the slack and wrinkle presence of usual fabrics appropriately. The lamp's glow in the scene is rendered warmly, similar to Image A, enhancing the natural ambiance without introducing any visible artifacts. This retention ensures that Image B maintains a consistent and natural look appropriate for a chibi style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features and suit details of both chibi characters rendered with sufficient detail and texture to avoid looking unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi versions are designed with stylized proportions typical of chibi art, which usually include simplified features yet expressive characteristics. Their suits retain identifiable features such as buttons and lapels. Despite the simplified chibi form, the depiction avoids flat or overly smooth textures, suggesting that the details are sufficient to provide a natural appearance for this style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the hands of the chibi characters, especially the one holding the cup, appear proportionate and physically plausible without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the hand holding the cup has a rounded, stylized characteristic typical to chibi but remains proportionate within that style, ensuring the hand fits naturally with the stylization of the chibi character. The grip on the cup appears plausible, with no evident distortion, indicating a careful balance between the chibi style and physical plausibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the addition of the photo frame around the chibi-style 3D scene enhance the visual credibility and realism of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The photo frame in Image B adds a tangible boundary to the scene, situating the chibi-rendered environment as a 'framed picture.' The frame contributes to the perception of a composed artwork or photograph, offering a contextual connection that enhances the scene's credibility without overpowering the internal details. This careful addition helps maintain a unified and visually authentic representation.",
