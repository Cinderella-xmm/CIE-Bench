    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the individual bead segments aligned in a smooth, continuous curve that mimics the natural curvature of a serpent's body without abrupt angular breaks or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bead segments are designed to form the body of a serpent, with a careful arrangement that follows a smooth and sinuous line characteristic of a snake's natural movement. The visual appearance suggests a deliberate design where these segments align seamlessly, avoiding sharp angles or disjointed parts. This crafting effort portrays a flowing, naturalistic curve which is indicative of a serpent's body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blue circular elements positioned at the head end of the serpent in a symmetrical, forward-facing arrangement typical of animal eyes, and do they appear integrated into the surface rather than floating or disconnected?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a serpent whose head features prominent blue circular elements that resemble eyes. These are symmetrically placed at the head's end, aligning with typical positioning for eyes on animals. The design integrates these 'eyes' into the surface securely, giving the appearance of being part of the head structure, rather than appearing as misplaced or hovering elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the black tribal markings follow the natural flow of the serpent’s body segments and avoid sharp, unnatural edges or uniform repetition that suggests digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the serpent's body is adorned with black tribal markings that conform to the curved structure of the beads that make up its body. These markings appear to flow with the bead segments smoothly, enhancing the serpent's aesthetic with a natural, continuous line of design. They avoid exhibiting any harsh, jagged lines or repetitive patterns that could imply an artificial creation, highlighting a coherence with the body's undulating form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tail extend naturally from the rear of the serpent, tapering smoothly and ending in small, loosely connected bead-like tips that appear to hang or sway without breaking the continuity of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail of the serpent in Image B is depicted to extend naturally from its body and tapers smoothly towards the end. The visual portrayal includes small bead-like tips at the tail's conclusion, which gives a subtle impression of motion or potential swaying. These bead-tips are portrayed as a part of the tail’s continuous fluid form, without appearing disjointed or abruptly attached.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the surface texture of the serpent’s body uniformly matte or slightly glossy like the original beads, without introducing areas of unnatural shine, roughness, or inconsistent material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface texture of the serpent's body exhibits characteristics similar to the original beads in Image A, with a consistent, slightly glossy surface. This suggests that the artist intended to mimic the material property of the beads, maintaining consistency without introducing unnatural shine or rough patches. This helps the serpent appear as a coherent piece, crafted with similar materials used for the beads in the original image.",
