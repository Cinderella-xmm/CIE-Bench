    "Question": "Q1: Are the wood-carved hat and scarf clearly distinguishable from the original fabric textures, with consistent grain patterns and engraved details that follow natural wood structure without distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and scarf appear to be crafted with wood, showcasing distinct grain patterns and detailed engravings typical of wood carvings. The textures and patterns are consistent and resemble natural wood, which suggests that the transformation from fabric textures in Image A to wood is well executed without distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the LEGO bricks form a continuous, anatomically plausible layer over the dog’s body without gaps, overlapping inconsistencies, or floating pieces that violate physical logic?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO bricks on the dog’s body in Image B are arranged to cover the body fully, creating a visually coherent surface. The bricks fit together without visible gaps or overlaps, forming a continuous layer that adheres to the logical arrangement of LEGO construction, thereby appearing anatomically plausible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the light-colored wooden tabletop background evenly lit and seamlessly integrated with the subject, without abrupt transitions or shadow mismatches that suggest poor compositing?",
    "explanation": "Image B's background, a light-colored wooden tabletop, is evenly lit and provides a consistent and harmonious backdrop for the subject. The lighting does not reveal any abrupt transitions or shadow mismatches, indicating good compositing with the subject's overall presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the ear flaps of the wood-carved hat properly shaped and positioned symmetrically on both sides of the dog’s head, without deformation or disproportionate scaling?",
    "explanation": "The ear flaps in Image B are symmetrically positioned and mirror the shape on both sides of the dog’s head. They exhibit proportional scaling relative to the rest of the wreath, suggesting a careful composition devoid of deformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the LEGO bricks exhibit consistent edge definition, proper shading, and logical placement across the dog’s body, avoiding blocky artifacts or color clumps that break visual continuity?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO bricks in Image B display consistent edge definition and proper shading, adhering closely to logical placement over the dog's body. The colors are distributed uniformly, preventing blocky artifacts or clumpy color distributions that would disrupt visual harmony.",
    "answer": "Yes"
