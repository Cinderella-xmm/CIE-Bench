      "question": "Does the snowy tundra landscape appear naturally integrated with the Leaning Tower of Pisa without any visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Leaning Tower of Pisa is placed in a snowy tundra landscape. The edges where the tower meets the snow do not show visible seams or poorly integrated lines. The overall appearance lacks any obvious cut-and-paste artifacts, suggesting a well-executed integration of the two elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the snowy tundra landscape consistent with the natural appearance of the original image, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowy tundra landscape in Image B appears smooth and consistent in texture, matching what one would expect of a snow-covered area in cold environments. There are no apparent artifacts or textures that seem out of place or inconsistent with typical snow, contributing to a realistic portrayal.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the Leaning Tower of Pisa maintain its structural coherence and proportions against the new snowy tundra background, without any distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Leaning Tower of Pisa is depicted without any distortion or breaks in its structure. The tower retains its familiar architectural form and leans at its usual angle, ensuring its proportions are consistent and accurate, even against the new tundra background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine architectural details of the Leaning Tower of Pisa been preserved, and does the snowy tundra background lack any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The architectural details of the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Image B, such as the arches and columns, have been preserved with clear sharpness. The snowy background remains consistent in detail without any noticeable blurring or loss that would suggest an unnatural combination.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the elements of the snowy tundra landscape, such as snow-covered ground and trees, appear physically plausible and proportionate relative to the size of the Leaning Tower of Pisa?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowy tundra elements, such as the snow-covered ground, are plausible in relation to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. There are no trees visible in the image to consider, but the general snow landscape does not contain disproportionate features that would disrupt the sense of scale. The placement and proportion of the snow make the scene appear realistic.",
