    "Question": "Q1: Does the elder’s face show natural skin texture, realistic wrinkles, and facial proportions without distortion or unnatural smoothing?",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the tree trunks and branches in the background structurally coherent, with natural bark texture and no broken or warped shapes?",

The tree shapes are preserved but simplified and have uniform patterns consistent with such artistic depictions. This stylization causes a departure from the natural, detailed texture in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the water surface reflect the surrounding trees and sky accurately, with smooth gradients and no distorted or duplicated elements?",
