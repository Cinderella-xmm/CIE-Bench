      "question": "Does the laboratory background in Panel 1 have consistent lighting and depth alignment with the foreground figure, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The laboratory background in Panel 1 is composed of various chemistry-related objects and test tubes. The lighting on these objects and the overall depth of the scene appears to be consistent with the style and shading of the foreground figure. This suggests a coherent alignment where elements are integrated rather than seemingly floating or disconnected.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the text bubbles and labels in both panels avoid overlapping critical facial or clothing features, and are they aligned with natural reading direction without clipping or misplacement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text bubbles and labels in both panels are strategically placed to avoid covering important elements like facial or clothing features. They remain within the natural reading flow, positioned correctly without any misalignment or clipping issues.",
