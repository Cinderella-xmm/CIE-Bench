    "Question": "Q1: Does the schematic outline of the wallet maintain accurate proportions and closed geometric shapes without jagged edges or missing lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the schematic outline of the wallet is depicted with clean, straight lines forming rectangular shapes. There are no jagged edges or missing lines, as the wallet's main structure is enclosed and geometrically regular, adhering to the common visual representation of an outline drawing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the lines forming the wallet’s schematic structure uniformly thin, continuous, and free of smudges or inconsistent thickness that suggest texture or artifact?",
    "explanation": "The schematic representation in Image B uses uniformly thin lines that are continuous throughout the structure of the wallet. They contain no smudges or inconsistencies in thickness, ensuring clarity in the illustration, which is typical for schematic diagrams aiming to convey clear structural understanding without textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the text annotations for “USD,” “QAR,” and “INR” placed adjacent to their respective banknote slots without overlapping the notes or distorting the wallet’s layout?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text annotations 'USD,' 'QAR,' and 'INR' are placed strategically near the wallet but do not overlap the schematic notes. They maintain an organized layout which is typical for clear information design, avoiding disruption of the overall schematic layout of the wallet.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the exchange rate charts and country economy icons aligned horizontally or vertically in a balanced manner, with no floating or misplaced elements that disrupt visual flow?",
    "explanation": "The exchange rate charts and economic icons in Image B are aligned vertically below the wallet schematic in a balanced manner. This visual hierarchy contributes to a clear and orderly presentation of information, with no misaligned or floating elements present, ensuring a streamlined visual flow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the visible banknotes (USD $20, QAR 10, INR 50) retain clear denominations, readable text, and intact designs without blurring, stretching, or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the banknotes are represented schematically and thus do not show real-world denominations, text, or detailed designs. Instead, they feature simplified shapes with labels '1,' '10,' and '40' for illustrative purposes. Therefore, there is no context of blurring, stretching, or pixelation as the depiction is minimalist and schematic by design.",
    "answer": "No"
