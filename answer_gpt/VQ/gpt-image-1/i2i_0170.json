      "question": "Are the clothing and bags of both women depicted with soft gradient blocks that retain their original shapes and proportions without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction is more illustrative and stylized with soft gradient blocks, yet retains the overall shapes and proportions of the clothing and bags. The style conversion results in a smooth appearance without introducing artifacts, maintaining the design of each clothing piece and accessory recognizable, although not textured or detailed compared to Image A. This observation is coherent with world knowledge of illustrative styles often simplifying textures while keeping shapes intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the mannequins and their outfits inside the store window appear structurally coherent and visually plausible in terms of shape and material after the style conversion, without any noticeable distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mannequins and outfits in Image B are rendered in a simplified, illustrative style that maintains structural coherence and proportions akin to their real-world counterparts. The visual plausibility is maintained even though the detailed textures are replaced with flat colors that suggest form without distortion, aligning with common practices in digital illustration or animated styles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the storefront maintain its original architectural details, such as the frame and tiles, without any visible distortion or introduction of non-natural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized representation of the storefront that mirrors its original architectural layout, maintaining elements like the frame's position and shape. The details are simplified into color blocks without texture detail, but this stylistic choice doesn't distort form, nor does it introduce elements not found in real-world architecture, consistent with typical illustrative or graphic design styles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the texture of the cobblestone pavement represented naturally with soft gradients, maintaining the structural integrity and visual coherence without any loss of detail or unnatural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cobblestone pavement is represented using simplified shading without detailed texture, yet the arrangement and visual coherence are maintained through soft gradients, which are common in illustrations to provide a clean, simplified impression while preserving structural integrity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the lighting effects and shadows in the image convincingly portrayed with soft gradient blocks, ensuring they contribute to the overall realism and natural appearance without breaking the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses soft gradients, typical of stylized artwork, to emulate lighting and shadow effects across the scene. These gradients contribute to visual flow, creating contrast and depth while ensuring the lighting is plausible within the illustrative context. This method aligns with world knowledge of gradient use in art to convey lighting naturally without harsh lines.",
