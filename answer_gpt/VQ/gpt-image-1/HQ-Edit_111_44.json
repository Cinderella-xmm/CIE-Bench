        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden embroidery patterns on the dress of the central figure appear rich in detail and are uniformly interwoven with the fabric, indicating a high level of craftsmanship. There are no visible artifacts or signs of repetitive digital patterns that would disrupt the flow of the embroidery. The seamless integration of intricate patterns supports the notion that the texture is consistent and not artificially manipulated.",
