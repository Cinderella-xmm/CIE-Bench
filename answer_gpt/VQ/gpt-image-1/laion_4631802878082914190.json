      "question": "Are the animal characters positioned directly over the original locations of the process boxes without shifting or overlapping neighboring elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal characters are positioned to represent various stages of the data journey, like 'Business Understanding' and 'Modeling'. Each character aligns closely with the respective stage from Image A. However, their addition introduces slight shifts from the original process boxes, as fictional representation requires a balance between placement and visual storytelling. In Image A, the process boxes are tightly arranged to form a clear cycle without overlap. Comparatively, the placement in Image B shows some variance due to the creative integration of the character motif, indicating that they are not directly over the original locations without shifting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the playful paths between characters form a continuous, unbroken winding route that follows the circular structure of the original diagram without abrupt turns or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a journey path that is visually represented by a winding trail connecting the characters. Although it forms a central focus leading to the data crystals, the arrangement takes a more whimsical approach rather than strictly mimicking the circular cycle from Image A, which has precise directional arrows. This artistic choice results in some abrupt paths and logical gaps in continuity, breaking from the original diagram's straight-lined flow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the central cluster of glowing data crystals positioned at the center of the diagram and scaled appropriately so it does not dominate or shrink the surrounding characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing data crystals are positioned centrally and are scaled to maintain an appropriate presence among the surrounding characters. This cluster acts as a focal point without overshadowing individual character placements, each of which engages with the 'data' element creatively. Image A’s central data depiction is aligned similarly, ensuring consistency in scale relative to surrounding stages, showcasing a parallel in visual complexity without overpowering the content.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the speech bubbles placed near each character without overlapping them or other elements, and do they contain legible text that is consistent in font and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubbles in Image B are placed adjacent to each respective character, ensuring clarity by maintaining separate space from other elements like characters and paths. The text within is legible and uses a consistent font size and style conducive to easy recognition. In contrast, Image A lacks speech bubbles, instead utilizing clear labels within process boxes. Image B successfully incorporates speech bubbles without compromise to legibility and positioning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the animal characters display realistic limb positions and interactions with props (e.g., magnifying glass, laptop, clipboard) that conform to known anatomy and ergonomics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal characters are rendered with considerable creativity. Despite their anthropomorphic nature, their limbs and interactions with props such as magnifying glass, laptop, and clipboard are drawn to mimic realistic positions with respect to known anatomy. Each character is positioned naturally within its role, for instance, the raccoon using a laptop fittingly. This continuity across props and portrayal aligns with expected ergonomics and enhances storytelling. Image A doesn't involve characters, making direct comparison impossible but emphasizing the designed anthropomorphic realism in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all elements (characters, paths, background, text) rendered with consistent line art, shading, and color saturation, avoiding mismatched textures or sudden changes in style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a cohesive design where the characters, paths, background, and text are rendered consistently. The line art, shading, and color saturation are harmoniously integrated, showing attention to detail and style continuity. There are no abrupt or jarring changes, allowing for a seamless visual narrative. Image A employs a monochrome schematic style without complex shading or color mixing, whereas Image B’s unified artistic approach ensures consistency across compositional elements.",

      "question": "Is the title banner located at the top edge of the image, fully visible, and not overlapping any part of the diagram or characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title banner in Image B is positioned at the top edge, serving as an introductory label for the cartoon setting. It is fully visible and respects the narrative composition, with no overlap over the characters or paths underneath. This placement accords with decorative functionality without disrupting introspective flow. While Image A doesn’t incorporate a title banner, Image B’s included feature remains appropriately formatted and placed to ensure clarity.",
