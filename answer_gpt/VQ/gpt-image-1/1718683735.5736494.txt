    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi-style figurine retain proportionally consistent limbs and head size relative to the body, avoiding unnatural elongation or compression?",
    "explanation": "Chibi-style art typically features exaggerated proportions, such as larger heads and smaller bodies, but these should still maintain a sense of proportional balance specific to this style. In Image B, the limbs and head are proportionally consistent with the chibi aesthetic, where the head is larger relative to the body, and the limbs are shorter but proportionate. The design does not appear unnaturally elongated or compressed beyond the characteristic chibi exaggeration.",
