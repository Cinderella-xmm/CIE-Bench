    "Question": "Q1: Are the buildings and water surface inside the sphere free from unnatural bending or warping at the edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sphere acts similarly to a lens, which naturally causes elements inside to curve due to refraction and the curvature of the sphere itself. This distortion is typical when viewing objects through a spherical lens. The buildings and water surface appear to follow this natural curvature without any glaring discrepancies beyond what is expected in a spherical object.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the wooden beams and stucco surfaces of the houses retain clear, natural textures without pixelation or repeating patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the small scale of the buildings as they appear inside the sphere might make consistency in texture more challenging. However, upon inspection, the surfaces and materials appear smooth and maintain consistent texturing without obvious pixelation or repeating patterns, suggesting they have been rendered with attention to detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the water surface show smooth, continuous reflections of the buildings and sky without excessive glare or broken mirror-like effects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, considering the spherical nature distorting the visual aspects slightly, the water surface still appears to reflect buildings smoothly. There is no excessive glaring or broken mirror-like effect present, which indicates that the reflections were handled with consideration of the sphere's optical effects.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the added mini bridges connected to both banks and do the plants grow from valid surfaces without appearing suspended in air?",
    "explanation": "The mini bridges appearing in Image B show appropriate connections to both banks, and the few plants visible appear rooted on realistic surfaces. The scene suggests careful placement where elements obey physical logic, maintaining a realistic and grounded appearance within the constraints of the scale.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do all visible characters have five fingers per hand, natural limb proportions, and clothing that conforms to body shape without clipping or floating?",
    "explanation": "Due to the miniature nature of the scene in Image B, the characters are very small, limiting visibility of detailed features like fingers. However, their general limb proportions appear natural, and clothing seems to fit well without signs of clipping or floating, adhering to expected form even at reduced size.",
    "answer": "Yes"
