      "question": "Are the eyes and grin added to the energy blast positioned within the glowing orb and aligned with its curvature, without creating jagged edges or broken light paths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and grin are part of the character design within the glowing orb. The eyes and grin are positioned and aligned with the curvature, creating a smooth integration with the orb's glowing effect. The alignment ensures that the energy blast maintains continuity of design without any jagged edges or breaks in the light path.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dialogue bubble in Image B is placed at the top left corner of the panel. It does not overlap with Naruto's face or hand. The bubble has clean borders and contains clearly legible text, which makes it easy to read without interfering with the main character artwork.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motion lines and energy beams in Image B appear to converge smoothly at the fusion point. The energy displays a continuous flow that merges the two attacks effectively, and there are no abrupt breaks or misalignments visible. This continuity enhances the dynamic nature of the fusion represented in the image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the debris and elemental fragments are rendered with shadows and highlights that give them depth and the appearance of floating in a 3D space. The consistent lighting throughout the fragments contributes to a cohesive look, avoiding a flat, pasted appearance.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Naruto’s face in Image B appears to maintain the original character design features, such as the correct number of whisker marks and the appropriate eye shape.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
