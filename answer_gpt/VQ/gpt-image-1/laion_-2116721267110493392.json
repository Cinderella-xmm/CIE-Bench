      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the cartoon versions of the two boys have proportionally correct head shapes and facial features that align with typical human anatomy, without exaggerated or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon versions of the boys are depicted with exaggerated features typical of cartoon styles, such as large, round eyes and simplistic features that deviate from realistic human anatomy. However, these features align with common artistic liberties taken in cartoon design, where proportions are intentionally altered for artistic expression and appeal. Therefore, while the features are stylized, they are correct within the context of the medium.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cyan and lemon yellow furniture elements rendered with consistent material textures and lighting that match the surrounding environment, avoiding glossy or flat-painted artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the furniture elements such as the cyan and lemon yellow chairs and tables are rendered with a flat color style typical of cartoons. This style lacks the textures typically seen in realistic rendering, as it is intended to maintain a uniform, smooth appearance. This choice complements the overall aesthetic of the illustration and is consistent across the image, which aligns well with the environment since cartoons often prioritize uniform lighting and texture.",

      "question": "Are the floating books and animated tablet screen positioned in a way that respects spatial depth and casting appropriate shadows, ensuring they appear physically plausible within the classroom setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floating elements like books and the animated tablet screen are positioned within the frame to give the impression of activity and interaction. However, due to the cartoon style, they do not follow realistic physics or cast shadows. The lack of shadows and realistic depth is standard in cartoons to emphasize fun and imaginative scenarios rather than physical plausibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the robots and gadgets placed at appropriate scales and distances from the children, with smooth surfaces and no visible digital artifacts like aliasing or missing textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robots and gadgets are drawn at a scale and position that complements the two boys, ensuring focus on the playful interaction. Their surfaces are smooth, indicative of the cartoon style, which avoids complex textures and detailed aliasing present in more realistic renderings. This choice ensures a clean and engaging appearance without digital artifacts.",

      "question": "Is the title text clearly readable, positioned at the top without overlapping critical elements, and styled with clean lines and uniform thickness that match the playful aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title text 'CLASSROOM ADVENTURE' is prominently placed at the top of the image. The style is consistent with the overall playful and bright aesthetic of the illustration, using clean lines and uniform thickness. It is readable and does not overlap with other critical elements, ensuring clear communication of the theme.",
