    "Question": "Q1: Does the cat’s body maintain the original shape and proportions when transformed into quartz and obsidian crystals, with no visible warping or unnatural breaks in form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal cat maintains a consistent shape and proportions that align with a real cat's anatomy. The limbs, body, and head reflect a natural feline posture. The transformation to quartz and obsidian crystals does not introduce warping or unnatural breaks, preserving the overall form as originally intended.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the emerald crystal eyes positioned correctly within the eye sockets, showing consistent size, shape, and reflective qualities that match the original facial structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat features large, striking emerald crystal eyes. The positioning is well-aligned with the expected location of a cat's eyes relative to its facial structure. They are of consistent shape and size, complementing the cat's symmetrical appearance and conveying a sense of realism through their reflective qualities.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the cat’s front paws and hind legs properly positioned on the wooden block, with no floating or disconnected segments that violate physical logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the cat's paws and legs is coherent with the stance of a seated cat on a surface. The paws rest naturally on the wooden block without any indication of floating or segment disconnection. This signals a precise alignment with physical logic, respecting gravity and the cat's base of support.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the quartz and obsidian surfaces display realistic textures with natural variations in translucency, shading, and edge definition, without pixelation or unnatural smoothness?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the crystal cat exhibit realistic textures typical of quartz and obsidian, characterized by subtle variations in translucency and shading. The facets of the crystals are well-defined, avoiding pixelation or excessive smoothness, indicative of a skilled representation of these minerals' natural properties.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the wooden block visually consistent with the original image in terms of texture, color, and lighting, and does it cast appropriate shadows under the crystal cat without unnatural gaps or distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden block on which the crystal cat sits maintains consistency with the original image's texture, color, and lighting. Shadows are cast appropriately under the cat, adhering to the lighting direction and environmental conditions without introducing any unnatural artifacts or distortions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
