      "question": "Do the top portions of the candelabra now appear as transparent, tapered glass caps with realistic light behavior and smooth contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top portions of the candelabra are depicted as transparent, glass-like structures with a tapered design. These structures reflect light in a manner that is consistent with glass materials, showcasing realistic light behavior and smooth contours. The use of transparency and light reflection hints at a glass material, as they closely mimic how light interacts with transparent, tapered surfaces. Therefore, the description matches the visual representation in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arms and central shaft replaced with smooth, uninterrupted gold-finish tubing that reflects light consistently and lacks visible seams or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms and central shaft of the candelabra are shown with a smooth and consistent gold finish. The light reflects off these surfaces uniformly, indicating high polish and lack of texture inconsistencies. There are no visible seams or breaks, which suggests the design is seamless and fluid, characteristic of a high-quality gold-finish tubing.",

      "question": "Is the brand logo embossed on the base such that it blends naturally with the surrounding texture and does not introduce irregular depth or lighting anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B has an embossed brand logo that appears to integrate well with the surrounding texture of the object. The embossing is subtle and follows the shape of the base without creating awkward shadows or reflections that would indicate depth or lighting inconsistencies. This seamless integration is indicative of careful craftsmanship, ensuring the logo does not disrupt the overall design and texture of the surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floral-engraved patterns evenly distributed, following the contours of the candelabra without flattening, repeating unnaturally, or appearing as surface overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral-engraved patterns appear evenly distributed and conform to the candelabra's contours. This design choice ensures that the patterns do not look flat or like surface overlays. The engravings are three-dimensional, providing natural depth and avoiding any obvious repetition or interruption in the pattern, suggesting a well-crafted design that enhances the aesthetic appeal of the object.",

      "question": "Does the script font label on the central tube follow the curvature of the tube naturally, without warping, stretching, or overlapping with other surface details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The script font label on the central tube in Image B is designed to follow the curvature of the tube naturally. The font is not warped or stretched; it adheres smoothly to the shape of the cylinder without interfering with other design elements, such as engraved patterns. This natural adherence demonstrates attention to design detail, ensuring text legibility and aesthetic harmony with the candelabraâ€™s form.",
