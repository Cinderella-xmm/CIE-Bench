    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the wood grain patterns across the surface of the boot evenly distributed and consistent with natural wood textures, avoiding artificial or repetitive patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wood grain patterns are visually analyzed to assess their distribution and consistency. The patterns appear naturally distributed along the boot's surface, mimicking the look of real wood without obvious repetitions or artificial symmetry, typical of natural wooden objects.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the transitions between light and dark wood tones on the boot follow the same contour and depth as the original leather and rubber sections, ensuring no abrupt or unrealistic shifts in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the transitions between different wood tones appear smooth and follow the contours of the boot. These transitions logically mimic the areas where light and shadows would naturally occur on a three-dimensional object, avoiding abrupt color changes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lacing holes and surrounding reinforcement areas shaped precisely like the original metal hardware and fabric loops, without deformation or missing structural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replicates the shape of the lacing holes and reinforcement areas from Image A but with a wooden texture. These structures maintain their shapes accurately, resembling the original hardware and loops, without visible deformities or missing elements caused by the material change.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden shelf flat, stable, and properly aligned beneath the boot, with no visible warping, floating, or unsupported edges that break physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden shelf is aligned properly beneath the boot, with its surface flat and stable. The edges do not appear to float or lack support, adhering to logical physical expectations for such a structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the boot retain its original three-dimensional shape, including toe box, heel, and ankle support, without any stretching, flattening, or irregular bulges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B successfully maintains the original three-dimensional shape of the boot, including key areas like the toe box, heel, and ankle support. There are no noticeable signs of distortion, such as flattening or unnatural bulges, maintaining the boot's structural integrity.",
