      "question": "Are the metallic textures added to the camera body natural, maintaining the camera's structural coherence without visible artifacts or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steampunk style employs a sepia-toned, intricately detailed design giving the camera a metallic, industrial appearance. The textured structures adhere well to the camera body’s shape, following its contours and details without visible artifacts or distortion. The coherence of the design suggests a skilled adaptation into the steampunk aesthetic.",
