      "question": "Is the cylindrical body of the tea canister proportionally consistent with the original teapot’s scale and maintains continuous, undistorted dragon engravings along its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tea canister has a cylindrical shape which deviates from the rounded, ornate form of the original teapot in Image A. The dragon engravings on the tea canister appear continuous and undistorted across the surface. However, due to the change in shape from a spherical teapot body to a cylindrical canister, the proportions of the original engravings might not be consistent with the original teapot's scale. The logic here involves understanding how a change in object geometry can influence the artwork's proportionality despite its visual continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the screw cap appear seamlessly integrated with the canister body, with no visible seams or mismatched textures, and does it exhibit consistent metallic sheen and fine leaf embossing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the screw cap of the tea canister appears to seamlessly integrate with the body of the canister, showing no visible seams. The texture and metallic sheen are consistent with the body, and the leaf embossing appears fine and detailed. This observation is based on recognizing standard features of well-designed objects where uniform texture and sheen are indicative of good craftsmanship.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"Dragon's Delight\" aligned smoothly along the spout’s curve, with legible, evenly spaced characters that do not distort the underlying metal texture or cause unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Dragon's Delight' on Image B is not aligned along the spout's curve but rather printed on the body of the canister. The text is legible and evenly spaced. The spout features text as well but only consists of 'DRAGON'S,' not related to the alignment query. The reasoning involves differentiating where text is intended to appear and ensuring readability and spacing irrespective of object curvature.",

      "question": "Is the tea leaf logo centered on the cap’s top, rendered with clean lines and uniform depth, and free from jagged edges or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tea leaf logo in Image B is indeed centered on the cap's top. It features clean lines and appears free from any jagged edges or inconsistent lighting, maintaining uniform depth. The visualization here involves assessing logo design, focusing on symmetry, detail, and lighting consistency, which are typical quality indicators for logo placement.",

      "question": "Are the dragon engravings fully intact and evenly distributed across the cylindrical body, with no gaps, repetition, or warping that would suggest deformation during the shape conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon engravings appear fully intact and evenly distributed across the cylindrical body of the canister. There are no visible gaps, repetition, or warping evident, which suggests careful preservation of the artwork during conversion from the teapot's original shape to that of the canister. This inference is based on examining engraving continuity and uniformity as well as applying the concept of non-distorted artwork in shape transformations.",
