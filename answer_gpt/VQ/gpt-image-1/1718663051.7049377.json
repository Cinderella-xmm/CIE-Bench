      "question": "Are the branches of the tree composed of clean, angular geometric lines consistent with Art Deco style, without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a depiction of a tree using stained glass-style design elements. The branches are composed of clean, angular lines with geometric shapes, consistent with the Art Deco style known for its emphasis on symmetry and streamlined forms. There are no jagged edges or unnatural breaks in the structure, which aligns with typical characteristics of Art Deco designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the grass in the foreground display muted, uniform coloration with preserved textural details such as individual blades or soft gradients, rather than appearing uniformly flat or artificially colored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass is depicted as part of a stained glass style composition which means expecting certain uniformity in color with detailed segmentation typical to stained glass. The grass is made with segmented pieces, giving it an impression of a uniformly colored texture rather than detailed individual blades or soft gradients. This results in a flat appearance indicative of stained glass, hence only indirect textural details are presented.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the mountain silhouettes composed of defined angular planes in bronze and teal tones, maintaining layered depth and spatial consistency without overlapping or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows mountain silhouettes as part of stained glass artwork, using angular planes and stained glass sections in bronze and teal tones. These segments maintain a visual separation of depth and spatial consistency, typical to such art style, with no overlapping or floating parts. The tones help in distinguishing layers, creating a cohesive stained glass representation of mountains.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the sky feature a smooth gradient from dark at the top to lighter near the horizon, with thin, evenly spaced accent lines that follow the curvature of the scene without intersecting or distorting the starfield?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is designed with stained glass, meaning that a smooth gradient is less likely, as it generally employs sections with specific colors rather than gradients. The accent lines are part of the stained glass style, intended to visually segment the sky, rather than representing a gradient effect as in a painted or photographic scene. There are no stars depicted, hence no starfield to distort or intersect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all elements—tree, mountains, and sky—rendered with consistent stained glass-style outlines and fills, lacking transparent patches, misaligned edges, or inconsistent shading within the same layer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is rendered in a consistent stained glass style, where outlines are uniformly applied across elements like the tree, mountains, and sky. Each segment is filled with solid colors typical of stained glass, with no transparent patches or misaligned edges, and each layer maintains consistent shading across its own structures. This is characteristic of a well-executed stained glass depiction.",
