      "question": "Does the kitten's body appear structurally consistent without any unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten is depicted with its body coming out of the computer screen, creating a 3D effect. Examining the available body parts visible in the image (aside from the blurred face), particularly the paws and the ears, there is no indication of unnatural distortions or artifacts that might suggest an inconsistency. The proportions and alignment appear to follow a natural perspective. This suggests a consistent rendering of the kitten's body structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fur details around the kittenâ€™s face natural and free from any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even though the face is blurred, the fur on the parts of the kitten that is visible outside the blurring (like around the ears and possibly parts of the cheeks) still presents a natural look. There are no signs of tampering with texture that could introduce unnaturalness, and the fur details visible match the expected texture of a cat's coat.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the kitten's position and perspective accurately simulate a 3D jumps-out effect without breaking its geometric shapes or distorting its proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten is shown emerging from a screen, implying a 3D effect. The limbs and ears that emerge seem correctly aligned and proportioned based on common perspectives and angles in 3D space. There are no visible breaks or distortions indicating an unnatural alteration of perspective.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the material properties of the blue blanket around the kitten look natural, supporting the 3D illusion without introducing any artificial artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The material of the blue blanket appears to maintain a realistic texture, resembling a soft, plush fabric. The 3D effect does not seem to have impacted the continuity or the feel of the blanket's material in a negative way, and there is no evidence of artificial artifacts that might disrupt the blanket's appearance or texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the kitten's paws shaped naturally, consistently placed, and free from any distortion or unrealistic deformations after applying the 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten's paws emerging from the screen seem to have a natural shape and are consistent with the position and alignment relative to the rest of the body, maintaining the overall coherence of the 3D effect. There are no apparent distortions or deformations that indicate an error in representation.",
