      "question": "Do the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls feature pyramid-inspired designs that are coherent with the original pyramid structure without unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style nesting dolls display pyramid-inspired designs, evident in their pointed tops and brick patterning similar to the pyramid's masonry seen in Image A. This shows a coherent design, maintaining pyramid characteristics without distortions. The dolls translate the pyramid's architectural elements into a stylized form while preserving the integrity of these features.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls arranged in a descending size order on the wooden table without any distortion or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the nesting dolls arranged in descending order from largest to smallest, preserving natural scaling. This arrangement is deliberate and coherent, enhancing visual appeal without any visible distortions or irregular scaling, adhering to common design principles.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls retain a natural texture and fine details that resemble the stone texture of the original pyramid without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls in Image B replicate the intricate stonework seen in the pyramid of Image A by using a detailed brick pattern. This approach maintains a sense of authenticity by preserving fine details associated with the stone texture. The visual translation from pyramid to doll does not introduce unnatural artifacts or texture inconsistencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the transition from the stone pyramid to chibi-style Russian nesting dolls preserve the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the scene without disrupting its visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition from the stone pyramid structure to chibi-style dolls in Image B retains authenticity through consistency in design elements â€” notably the brick pattern and overall shape. Such elements mirror the pyramid itself from Image A, allowing for a harmonious adaptation without disruption of the scene's visual integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sophisticated wooden table complement the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls and fit naturally within the environment of the original image without introducing visual inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden table serves as a neutral and elegant backdrop for the nesting dolls. It contrasts yet complements the stone-like appearance of the dolls, enhancing the scene's natural aesthetic. While Image A is set outdoors, the transition to an indoor representation with the table does not visually clash with the pyramid inspiration but rather subtly shifts its context in a consistent manner.",
