    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the body of the seahorse exhibit a consistent translucent pink glass appearance with visible subtle bubble textures, and are there no areas where the texture appears jagged, inconsistent, or artificially applied?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse body appears to be made of translucent pink glass, showing subtle bubble textures that are evenly distributed and consistent throughout the surface. The texture does not appear jagged, nor does it look inconsistent or artificially applied, which indicates a high-quality rendering. This interpretation relies on world knowledge of how glass can appear when crafted with bubbles for aesthetic purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the yellow belly rendered as a smooth, opaque glass surface with a precisely etched music note inside a heart, and are the edges of the symbol clean without blurring or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow belly of the seahorse appears smooth and exhibits an opaque glass quality. The music note is etched within a heart on the belly, with clearly defined lines, free from blurring or deformation. World knowledge about etched symbols on glass informs us that precise and consistent symbol edges suggest a well-designed piece.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ribbons on the head and fins rendered as solid lavender glass with smooth surfaces and light reflections, and do they maintain their original shape without warping or appearing stretched or flattened?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the ribbons on the head and fins are rendered in a lavender hue, resembling solid glass. The material reflects light effectively, suggesting smooth surfaces. Furthermore, they maintain their intended shape without visual signs of warping or distortion. This conclusion is drawn from world knowledge about glass sculpture characteristics, which often reflect light smoothly if expertly crafted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the seahorse positioned on a flat, reflective black surface that shows clear mirror-like reflections of its base and lower body, and is the stand seamlessly integrated without gaps or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse sits on a flat black base exhibiting reflective qualities, mirroring the seahorse's base and lower body clearly. This suggests a polished surface typical of high-quality stands or platforms used in art displays. The integration of the stand with the seahorse is seamless, as no gaps or floating effects are visible. World knowledge on reflective surfaces supports that such clarity in reflection indicates good craftsmanship.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all elements—body, belly, fins, ribbons, and base—visually consistent in lighting, shadow, and material properties, with no mismatched highlights, color shifts, or artificial edges suggesting poor blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows all components of the seahorse—body, belly, fins, ribbons, and the base—with consistent lighting and shadowing, as well as uniform material properties. The highlights and reflections are congruent across different elements, lacking any mismatched color shifts or artificially sharp edges. This indicates careful blending and suggests a coherent visual presentation, which aligns with world knowledge of high-quality art rendering.",
