    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figure proportionally scaled and positioned within the globe such that her body parts (especially limbs and head) maintain natural anatomical alignment and do not appear stretched or compressed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure appears to be accurately scaled and the positioning of her limbs and head within the globe maintains a natural anatomical alignment. The arms are comfortably resting in the lap, and there is no indication of distortion that would suggest stretching or compression. The proportions of the body parts seem reasonable, supporting the interpretation that the scale and position within the globe allow for a realistic portrayal of the figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the intricate patterns on the dress and the braided hairstyle clearly visible and free from blurring, aliasing, or loss of fine detail after conversion to a 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dress with clear and intricate patterns that maintain their detail, suggesting a high-quality conversion to the 3D model. The braided hairstyle is also depicted with distinct details which remain sharp and distinct, indicating there is no significant blurring, aliasing, or loss of fine detail. This observation supports the conclusion that the quality of visual information is preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wall patterns inside the globe accurately reflect the colors and shapes of the dress's pattern without warping, misalignment, or color deviation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns inside the globe in Image B match the design elements and colors of the dress. They appear to be well-aligned and free from noticeable warping or color deviation. This consistency suggests that the representation of the dress's pattern on the walls is precise and accurate, thereby capturing the essential features of the dress's design without distortion.",

      "question": "Are the miniature roots beneath the figure arranged in a way that follows natural growth patterns and does not intersect or distort the figure’s legs or skirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature roots are seamlessly integrated beneath the figure and extend outward in a way that mirrors natural growth. They do not intersect with or distort the position of the figure’s legs or skirt. The absence of any such interference suggests a thoughtful arrangement designed to preserve the integrity of the figure’s posture and the overall scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the miniature animals positioned at ground level with proper shadowing and scale relative to the figure, and do they have natural textures and forms without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature animals within the globe in Image B appear to be positioned appropriately at ground level relative to the figure. Their scale is consistent with the overall miniature setting, and the textures and forms of the animals look natural without noticeable artifacts. Proper shadowing contributes to the realism and gives the appearance of being part of the scene rather than superimposed.",
