    "Question": "Q1: Do the metallic textures on the cyclist’s outfit and helmet reflect light consistently with the scene’s illumination and maintain accurate surface contours without warping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cyclist’s outfit and helmet have a metallic texture, which suggests a reflective quality. The play of light on these surfaces should follow the direction and intensity of the light sources in the scene, which is designed to appear dynamic and futuristic with a neon effect. The metallic surfaces wrap smoothly around the contours of the cyclist's body and helmet, reflecting light consistently without disruptions or distortions, which suggests an effective rendering of light interaction typical for metallic surfaces. The surfaces align with the scene's neon theme and lighting, maintaining accurate shape without warping.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the electric blue neon glow lines along the road edges and on the cyclist and car smooth, evenly lit, and free from jagged edges or overlapping with real-world details like tires or license plates?",
    "explanation": "The electric blue neon glow lines in Image B are designed to emphasize speed and modern technology, flowing seamlessly along the road edges and highlighting the cyclist and car. These lines should be smooth without jagged edges, suggesting precision in digital enhancement. They are uniformly bright and should not overlap in a way that obscures or interferes with other elements such as tires or license plates. The edited image maintains these requirements, showing a consistent neon theme that enhances rather than disrupts the overall scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the transparent visor data display on the cyclist’s helmet aligned with the helmet’s curvature, showing clear digital content without ghosting, blurring, or distortion?",
    "explanation": "The visor data display in Image B is meant to provide digital information while seamlessly integrating with the helmet’s design. This means it should curve naturally with the helmet, maintaining clarity and focus. The visor should present digital content crisply without ghosting or blurring, which would suggest a lack of integration with the physical form of the helmet. In the edited image, the display is aligned correctly with the helmet's curvature, showcasing sharp and undistorted digital content.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the holographic cycling stats near the escort car spatially coherent, appropriately sized relative to the car, and displayed with soft edges and ambient glow without casting incorrect shadows?",
    "explanation": "The holographic cycling stats are an augmented feature in Image B, intended to provide additional information about the cycling event. These should be spatially coherent, meaning they must appear to be floating naturally in space without clashing with the car's scale or perspective. The display should have soft edges and an ambient glow that fits the high-tech theme, without erroneously casting shadows that do not align with the scene’s overall lighting. In the edited image, these stats are appropriately integrated, matching the surrounding elements and maintaining the visual harmony of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do all edited elements—including metallic finishes, neon glows, digital visor display, and holographic projections—coexist without visual contradictions such as mismatched lighting, texture clashes, or distorted shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edited elements like metallic surfaces, neon effects, digital displays, and holograms should be cohesive, working together within the same lighting and stylistic framework. There should not be any visual contradictions, such as lighting inconsistencies, texture clashes, or distorted shapes that break the illusion of a unified technological world. The metallic finishes, light effects, and digital projections should interact naturally, reflecting a well-designed, visually integrated scene. Upon evaluation, the edited elements in the image coexist without apparent contradictions, enhancing the futuristic theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"
