      "question": "Does the snow globe surrounding the latte art appear structurally coherent without distorting the Colosseum and Big Ben designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe around the miniature versions of the Colosseum and Big Ben appears to be well-integrated. The designs of the architectures do not show any signs of distortion or structural inconsistency within the glass sphere. They look proportionally accurate within the globe, suggesting that the editing maintains the structural coherence of these architectural features.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any visible unnatural textures or artifacts where the latte art transitions into the snow globe's glass surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The transition from the inside of the snow globe to its glass surface in Image B appears smooth and natural. There are no visible jagged lines, pixelations, or inconsistent textures that would indicate poor editing. The surface and interior elements seem to be blended seamlessly, indicating a high-quality edit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the miniature versions of the Colosseum and Big Ben inside the snow globe maintain their correct proportions and avoid appearing distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the Colosseum and Big Ben are rendered in their classic architectural proportions and do not appear squished or elongated, which confirms their proportions are preserved. They are miniaturized appropriately to fit the scale of the snow globe, maintaining a realistic appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the snowflakes in the snow globe add to the charm of the winter scene without obscuring or degrading the fine details of the Colosseum and Big Ben?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowflakes in Image B are dispersed throughout the snow globe and add a charming, wintry effect. The placement and opacity of the snowflakes are such that they do not obscure significant details of the Colosseum and Big Ben, allowing these structures to be clearly visible and detailed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background of the edited image softly blurred with a cozy café atmosphere that complements the snow globe without introducing inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is softly blurred, lending a warm and cozy atmosphere typical of a café setting. This blurring helps the snow globe stand out as the focal point of the image, and there are no inconsistencies or jarring elements that detract from the overall composition.",
