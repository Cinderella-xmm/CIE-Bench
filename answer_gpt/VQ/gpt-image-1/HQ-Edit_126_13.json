    {

      "question": "Do the annotated lines representing the tea journey follow a smooth, non-intersecting path around the tea set without overlapping or deforming the original objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The annotated lines in Image B visually trace a path from one step of the tea journey to another, integrating into the scene. They are placed in such a way that they provide clear progression without intersecting over the primary objects like the teapot, bowl, or vase. The lack of interference with these objects illustrates a conscientious design where the visual elements and their spatial arrangement are harmoniously aligned.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the handwritten calligraphy in soft pastel green seamlessly integrated into the scene without causing visual contrast or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The calligraphy in Image B uses a soothing pastel green color, which visualizes seamlessly with the warm tones and soft lighting in the image. This choice of color ensures the text is readable yet subtle, without harsh visual contrast or texture artifacts interrupting the composition. The script style also matches the overall tranquility and theme of the tea ceremony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the minimalist icons for each step of the tea journey proportionally scaled and visually coherent with the surrounding objects and layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The minimalist icons in Image B are proportionally scaled to fit within the scene without overpowering the existing objects like the teapot and table mat. Their design is simple, ensuring coherence with the clean and tranquil theme of the overall layout. Each icon appropriately matches the space and does not disrupt the existing visual balance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the added cherry blossom petals appear to float or fall naturally in the air without unnatural positioning or missing shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petals are carefully placed to simulate a natural falling or floating motion, consistent with how real petals might drift in air. They do not exhibit any unnatural positioning or lack of interaction with the lighting, which indicates well-rendered shadows and placement that align with the rest of the scene's lighting condition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the table mat, teapot, cup, and vase preserved without visible distortion, blurring, or artificial seams where new elements were added?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textures of the primary objects, namely the table mat, teapot, cup, and vase in Image B, appear intact and unaltered by the additions. There is no noticeable distortion or blurring, and the seamless integration of added elements like annotations suggests the preservation of the original textures. This smooth merging into the existing textures helps maintain realism and the quality of the image.",
