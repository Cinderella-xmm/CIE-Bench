    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass bottle form retain the original carâ€™s side profile and curvature without visible warping or disproportionate scaling?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass bottle is shaped like a car similar to the original Datsun car shown in Image A. By analyzing Image B, the side profile and curvature of the car appear smooth and proportional. The design is intended to mimic the real car's shape, and there is no visual evidence of warping or disproportionate scaling in the bottle's representation. The details, like the hood and side shape, are proportionate just like the actual vehicle.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the faceted glass stoppers aligned with the original headlight positions and do they show consistent lighting and reflection patterns with the surrounding glass?",
    "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the headlights appear to be part of the glass bottle structure rather than separate stoppers. They are positioned where the headlights of a car would naturally be, and they exhibit a consistent lighting and reflection pattern with the rest of the metal section of the bottle. However, they are not distinct 'stoppers' as the question suggests.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the gear-shaped lid positioned centrally on the roof and securely connected to the glass body without visible seams or floating edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a gear-shaped lid situated centrally on top of the car-shaped glass bottle, resembling a bottle cap. It appears to be securely attached without any visible edges or gaps, indicating a seamless connection. The placement on the roof is central, maintaining a balanced look.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the embossed Datsun emblem clearly visible on the front of the glass bottle and does it maintain proper depth and clarity without surface distortion?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, the Datsun emblem is embossed on the front of the glass bottle and is clearly visible. The logo maintains proper depth and clarity, and there is no apparent distortion on the surface. The text is legible and stands out against the bottle.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the glass body display natural reflections and highlights across its surface without abrupt transitions or artificial sheen?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the glass bottle displaying reflections and highlights typical of a glossy, transparent material. The surface has natural reflections, and there are no abrupt shifts or unnatural gloss that would indicate editing artifacts or artificial enhancements. The reflective quality is consistent with how glass would naturally interact with light.",
    "answer": "Yes"
