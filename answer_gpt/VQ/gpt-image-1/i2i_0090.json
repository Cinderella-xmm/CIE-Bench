      "question": "Do the edges and contours of the stapler maintain their smoothness without any jagged or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the contours and edges of the stapler in both views are smooth and well-defined. The design appears intentional and polished, with no jagged lines or irregular breaks evident. This smoothness is visually appealing and consistent with the aesthetic of a well-manufactured object. World knowledge about product design suggests that high-quality items usually have smooth, precise edges.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blue color and metallic finish of the stapler consistent across both the front and back views with no visible texture discrepancies or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue color of the stapler is uniform across both views. The metallic parts, such as the hinges or visible metallic components, maintain a consistent finish, appearing smooth and polished. No color or texture discrepancies are visible upon examination, indicating a consistent application of color and material finish. World knowledge about manufacturing implies that uniform color and finish are hallmarks of a quality product.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the mechanical components such as screws and hinges depicted accurately and consistently between the two views, avoiding any illogical positioning or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical components such as screws and hinges appear consistent in both views. Their positions are logical and functionally appropriate for a stapler, suggesting that they are accurately depicted. No distortions or illogical placements are noted, supporting the functionality expected in standard stapler designs. World knowledge about the mechanics of staplers infers that these components should support movement without visual or structural inconsistencies.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the stapler match the lighting conditions in both views, ensuring a believable three-dimensional effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, shadows and highlights are applied consistently, suggesting a uniform lighting source reflecting on the stapler from a specific direction. This consistency helps create a realistic three-dimensional effect, where the shadows and highlights correspond appropriately to the object's shape and position, contributing to the overall believability of the scene. Knowledge of lighting principles explains how highlights and shadows enhance the perception of depth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the layout of the stapler's side-by-side views clear and uncluttered, with no distracting or misplaced elements disrupting the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layout is straightforward, with the stapler displayed in two adjacent views, providing a clear representation without any extraneous elements. This uncluttered presentation keeps the focus on the stapler, avoiding any visual noise that could distract from the product features. This clarity is effective for product visualization, drawing attention directly to the item's design and details.",
