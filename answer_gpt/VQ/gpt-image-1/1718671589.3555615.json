      "question": "Do the biscuit panels on the building walls exhibit uniform texture and color without visible cracks, patches, or unnatural grain patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the biscuit panels display a consistent texture and uniform color, characteristic of gingerbread, without any visible imperfections such as cracks or patches. This analysis assumes familiarity with common gingerbread aesthetics, which are typically smooth and evenly baked. The visual inspection shows no irregularities in the grain or texture of the panels, indicative of a skillfully crafted and decorated gingerbread structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sugar-glazed dome smoothly curved with consistent color and reflective properties, and does it align correctly with the base structure without appearing warped or misproportioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals the sugar-glazed dome with a smooth, consistent curve that reflects light evenly, typical of a well-crafted glazed surface. The dome aligns correctly with the base structure, maintaining proportional unity without signs of warping or misalignment. This judgment utilizes context of typical sugar decoration practices where uniformity and even reflection are desirable for aesthetic appeal.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the icing patterns on the windows and doors clearly defined, evenly applied, and positioned within the frame boundaries without overlapping or deforming the original window/door shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible icing patterns on Image B's windows and doors are well-defined and consistently applied, conforming to typical decorative precision seen in confectionery detailing. The icing adheres to the frame boundaries perfectly, maintaining the intended design shape without overlap or distortion. Confectionery designs often strive for precision and neatness, which is evident here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the tree trunks and branches maintain natural branching patterns, and are the sugar-coated leaves evenly distributed without clumping or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree trunks mimic natural branching patterns and structures typical in crafted sugar trees. The sugar-coated leaves are uniformly distributed, lacking any noticeable clumping or unnatural float that would distract from the realistic tree effect. Visual cues combined with typical sugar decoration and model-making practices suggest an intention to mirror naturalist scenes accurately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the marble slab extend continuously under the building and surrounding area, with consistent lighting and reflection, and no visible gaps or distortions at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marble slab in Image B extends continuously beneath the gingerbread building and its vicinity, exhibiting uniform lighting and reflection typical of marble surfaces. Examination reveals no gaps or edge distortions, affirming coherence and craftsmanship consistent with practical and aesthetic marble usage. This inference combines visual observation with knowledge of architectural display conventions where base materials typically have consistent finishes.",
