    "Question": "Q1: Do the fortress walls and towers exhibit a uniform golden-brown cookie dough texture with darker edges that match the lighting direction and do not show unnatural pixelation or inconsistent shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress walls and towers appear to have a uniform golden-brown texture that resembles cookie dough. The lighting in the image highlights darker edges symmetrically, suggesting a deliberate choice to evoke shadowing consistent with natural lighting conditions. There are no signs of pixelation or inconsistent shading that would indicate errors in rendering or poor quality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the waterfalls rendered as smooth, continuous streams of royal icing that follow the natural contour of the cliff and show appropriate sheen and thickness without appearing clumped or broken?",
    "explanation": "The waterfalls in Image B are depicted as smooth flows of royal icing. They follow the contour of the cliff in a consistent manner, displaying an appropriate sheen indicative of wet icing. The streams maintain a continuous appearance without showing any clumping or breaking that would suggest inconsistency or rendering issues.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the trees formed from green marzipan positioned naturally on the terrain, maintaining plausible size and shape without appearing compressed, misshapen, or disconnected from the ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trees crafted from green marzipan are positioned naturally around the fortress. They exhibit a plausible size and shape that aligns with the terrain and overall thematic design. The trees do not appear compressed, misshapen, or disconnected from the ground, indicating careful attention to realistic placement and rendering quality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the white ceramic platter clearly visible beneath the cookie fortress, extending outward with clean edges and casting a soft shadow that aligns with the light source, without appearing to float or distort the surrounding terrain?",
    "explanation": "The white ceramic platter is prominently visible beneath the fortress in Image B. It extends outward with clean edges that align with the overall composition. The shadow cast by it is soft and follows the lighting direction without causing distortion or giving the impression that the fortress is floating. This presentation suggests accurate rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there any visible seams, texture discontinuities, or abrupt transitions between the cookie dough fortress, royal icing waterfalls, and marzipan trees that suggest poor blending or rendering errors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there appears to be smooth blending between the cookie dough fortress, royal icing waterfalls, and marzipan trees. The textures maintain consistency and there are no visible seams or abrupt transitions that would indicate rendering errors. The elements seem well-integrated into the scene, contributing to a cohesive visual presentation.",
    "answer": "No"
