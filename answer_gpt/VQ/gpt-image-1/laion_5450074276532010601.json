      "question": "Do the red helmet and blue cap on the paddles maintain proportional size relative to the paddle heads and avoid stretching or warping the underlying rubber surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The paddles in Image B have cartoon expressions and accessories added to them, including a red helmet and a blue cap. These accessories appear proportionate to the size of the paddle heads, fitting comfortably and realistically without disturbing the intended cartoon style. There is no visible stretching or distortion of the paddles' rubber surface, suggesting the accessories are well-integrated.",

      "question": "Are the cartoon facial features and accessories on the paddles seamlessly integrated with no visible stitching, sharp edges, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays cartoon facial features with expressive eyes, mouths, and accessories like a helmet and cap. The artwork shows smooth lines and consistent shading, with no visible stitching or hard edges. This seamless integration points to quality illustration craftsmanship typical in character design to maintain appeal and coherence.",

      "question": "Are the golden edges confined to the perimeter of the box lid and base, without extending into the interior or forming disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box outline features golden edges that define the treasure chest's borders. These gold trim lines are confined to the perimeter of the box, creating a neat visual demarcation with no extensions into the interior. There are no disconnected or jagged segments, supporting the typical appearance and function of a treasure chest.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the speech bubbles have pointed tails directed toward the paddles and avoid overlapping with the box or paddle handles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble in Image B has a tail that points directly towards the red paddle, aligning perfectly with the character speaking. The bubble does not overlap with the box or the paddles' handles. The tail directs the conversation, keeping the clarity and integrity of a comic-style layout where speech bubbles point towards speakers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the treasure map background composed of uniformly drawn lines with no pixelation, aliasing, or irregular stroke widths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The treasure map design in the background of Image B uses uniform lines without visible pixelation or aliasing. The map lines are consistent in stroke width, typical for clean graphic design ensuring no degradation of visual quality. The uniformity suggests a professionally executed illustration suitable for the image's style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the paddles tilted upward from the box but still supported by the handle slots, maintaining structural plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The paddles in Image B appear animated, lifted upward from a treasure chest. However, this is a cartoon depiction; hence, structural plausibility, typically required in logical setups, does not strictly apply here. The image's whimsical style prioritizes creativity over realism, even ignoring handle slots for supporting paddles properly, so structural plausibility in a literal sense is compromised.",
