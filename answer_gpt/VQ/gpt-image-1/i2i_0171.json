      "question": "Do the skis appear naturally detached from the skier with no visible artifacts or unnatural distortions in their shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skis are shown as detachable parts. Observing their depiction reveals that the skis appear smoothly shaped with no visible artifacts or distortions around their detachment points. The design suggests a natural transition to being detachable components of the figurine form, which is typical for toy-like designs. Given this visual consistency, they appear naturally detached without compromising their shape.",

      "question": "Does the magnetic snow powder base integrate seamlessly into the snowy landscape without introducing unnatural textures or breaking the scene's structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the skier figurine with a magnetic snow powder base intended to represent snow. Given the stylized toy-like design, it appears consistent with such items aimed at representing snowy bases. It complements the overall figurine setup, blending into the toy aesthetic without seeming out of place or breaking the visual consistency intended in the figurine design.",

      "question": "Are the skier's facial features and body proportions accurately preserved in the figurine form, avoiding any distortions or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skier figurine is stylized to fit a toy model design. While facial features are not visible, the body proportions adhere to common figurine design principles, wherein proportions are often altered for aesthetic or functional reasons. The figurine maintains details in the skiing posture and attire consistent with real-world skier appearances. Hence, the body proportions and design of the figurine remain credible and detailed.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging illustrations show the skier and mountain environment with a stylized approach. The cartoon-like depiction aligns with common practices for toy packaging illustrations designed to attract attention while maintaining thematic accuracy. The snowy environment and skier are rendered without introducing anomalies, respecting the intended toy aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are the skier's hands, ski poles, and posture anatomically correct and visually credible compared to the original image, with no unnatural shapes or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B with Image A, the skier's posture and holding of ski poles are represented accurately in the figurine form. Although the proportions are stylized to match a figurine design, they retain consistent anatomical plausibility suited to toy aesthetics and do not introduce noticeably unnatural shapes or distortions. The hands and ski poles are credibly modeled for the figurine's purpose.",
