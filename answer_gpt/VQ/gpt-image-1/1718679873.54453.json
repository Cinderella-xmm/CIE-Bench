      "question": "Does the miniature robot model retain accurate proportions and intact geometric shapes compared to the original robot, with no visible stretching, compression, or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature robot model in Image B appears to be a faithful scale model of a giant robot. Its proportions and geometric shapes are clean and consistent with what would be expected from a full-size robot. There is no visible stretching or compression, and the joints appear aligned correctly. This suggests that the model retains the accurate proportions and intact geometry as depicted in Image A, an essential factor for maintaining a realistic representation in a scaled-down version.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the circular display case transparent and smooth, with natural light interaction and no jagged edges, double outlines, or artificial artifacts around its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular display case in Image B is designed to showcase the miniature model. It appears transparent and smooth, with light interacting naturally across its surface. There are no visible jagged edges, double outlines, or artificial artifacts that would indicate poor rendering or editing. This smoothness and transparency are critical for a display case meant to protect and highlight a delicate or detailed item like a miniature model.",

      "question": "Are the tiny gears visible under transparent panels correctly aligned with the robotâ€™s surface, uniformly detailed, and free from overlapping or floating anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detailed tiny gears on the robot model's exterior seem uniformly integrated, fitting logically into the robot's surface design. They do not display any noticeable misalignment, overlap, or floating effect that would be visually jarring. This uniformity and seamless integration are necessary to convey a sense of mechanical realism and detail in miniature models.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hexagonal base geometrically precise, with uniform edges and a consistent matte-black finish, and does the model number text appear sharp and evenly glowing without haloing or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hexagonal base in Image B seems geometrically precise, featuring uniform edges that are characteristic of well-crafted display stands. Its matte-black finish appears consistent, providing a clean backdrop for the model number. The text 'RX-78' is sharp, with an evenly glowing appearance, and there is no evident haloing or distortion that would diminish the professionalism of the display.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the mini landscape surrounding the display include naturally scaled trees, ground textures, and distant cityscape elements that maintain spatial consistency with the size of the display case and model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mini landscape in Image B around the display appears to include elements such as trees and ground textures that are consistent with the scale of the model and its case. The trees and other elements maintain a believable size and orientation, so the spatial consistency is preserved. While the distant cityscape elements in the first image are not present or not visible due to the scale and type of display case, the overall scene seems cohesive and appropriate for a miniature setting.",
