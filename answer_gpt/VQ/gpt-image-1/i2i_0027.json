      "question": "Does the dog's body maintain a natural and structurally consistent pose in the chibi-style, without any noticeable distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is depicted in a chibi style, which is characterized by exaggerated features such as a large head and small body. Despite these exaggerations, the pose appears consistent with typical chibi stylization, giving off a playful and cute appearance without looking awkward or deformed. The limbs and facial features are proportionate within the chibi design, making the overall structure visually stable.",

      "question": "Has the enlarged head been integrated naturally into the image, without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style design inherently includes an enlarged head. In Image B, the head is smoothly connected to the body, and the texture of the head matches the rest of the dog figurine. There are no visible artifacts or mismatched textures around the head area. The illustration style is consistent throughout, ensuring the head appears naturally integrated.",

      "question": "Is the tennis ball touching the dog's nose in a way that looks natural and physically plausible, without any awkward positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball is positioned at the dog's nose, which is a common playful position for a dog and matches the playful chibi aesthetic. The ball appears nestled naturally under the nose, fitting well with the size and pose of the dog's head, avoiding any signs of awkward or unnatural positioning.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the relief tennis ball pattern on the base match well with the rest of the scene, contributing to a cohesive and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of Image B features a relief pattern of tennis balls, which complements the theme of the dog holding a tennis ball. This pattern matches the overall playful and thematic elements presented in the image. Its integration into the base provides a cohesive visual continuity, supporting the rest of the scene without feeling out of place.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the edited image retained the original focus on the ball while successfully integrating the chibi-style elements, resulting in a balanced and visually coherent composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Though Image A depicts a more literal interpretation of a dog's interaction with a ball, Image B shifts to a chibi style, increasing focus on cuteness and stylization. The tennis ball remains a focal point by being prominent and in shades that draw attention. Despite the playful redesign, the ball's importance is maintained, fitting within the chibi illustration and creating a visually balanced scene.",
