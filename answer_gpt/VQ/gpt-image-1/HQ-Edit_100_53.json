      "question": "Does the kimono feature bold, clean outlines and uniformly flat color regions without gradient blending or photographic texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono displayed has a style characteristic of traditional Japanese woodblock prints characterized by bold, clean outlines of the garments and uniformly flat color regions. The absence of gradient blending or photographic texture is evident, as the colors are applied in a flat, uniform manner typical of ukiyo-e prints. In contrast, Image A features detailed textures and gradient blending, which are traits of a photorealistic rendering.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms represented with simplified, stylized shapes and muted pink hues, avoiding photorealistic detail or irregular clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms are portrayed with simplified and stylized shapes, adhering to muted pink hues. This artistic representation avoids detailed realism and instead depicts the blossoms in a uniform, stylized manner, which is typical of traditional print styles. In Image A, the cherry blossoms have more realistic detailing and irregular clumping, unlike the stylized approach seen in Image B.",

      "question": "Do the path stones and vertical poles display textured patterns such as hatching, stippling, or woodgrain that align with traditional woodblock printing techniques?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the path stones and vertical poles showcase textured patterns such as hatching and stippling, which mirror the techniques used in traditional woodblock printing to suggest depth and texture. These patterns differ markedly from the realistic textures seen in Image A, where the stones and poles appear smooth and more lifelike.",

      "question": "Is the figure's body proportionate and structurally sound, with no exaggerated limbs, distorted joints, or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the figure with a kimono whose proportions seem consistent and structurally sound, showing no signs of exaggerated limbs, distorted joints, or unnatural bending. This aligns with traditional art forms that aim for aesthetically pleasing compositions. Image A similarly reflects accurate anatomical proportions, though within a more realistic style.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the distant hills depicted as simplified, layered forms with flat colors and clear outlines, consistent with traditional ukiyo-e landscape conventions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows distant hills as simplified, layered forms with flat colors and clear outlines, fitting the conventions of traditional ukiyo-e landscapes which favor stylization over realism. Image A, on the other hand, features a more realistic representation with depth and texture, marking a contrast with the stylized depiction in Image B.",
