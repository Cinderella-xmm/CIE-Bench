    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head of the character significantly larger than the body, with smooth, consistent scaling across facial features and neck, avoiding jagged edges or inconsistent proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon character has a large head compared to the body, which is a common trait in chibi-style art. The scaling of facial features is consistent, with smooth curves and no jagged edges, which is typical in well-rendered cartoon illustrations where proportions intentionally exaggerate the head size.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black outlines around the character's body and costume elements consistently thick, clean, and free of smudging or irregularities that suggest poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black outlines in Image B are bold, clean, and consistent throughout the character's body and costume elements. This is indicative of good quality cartoon design, where clear outlines are essential for defining shapes effectively without any smudging or irregularities.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the \"S\" symbol on the chest clearly visible, using bright red and yellow colors with no blurring, color distortion, or loss of definition at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'S' symbol on Image B's chest is clearly defined and features bright red and yellow colors, typical of Superman's iconic design. The edges are sharp without any blurring or color distortion, facilitating the recognition of the emblem.",

      "question": "Are the blue and red colors in the suit and cape uniformly vibrant and saturated, with no visible color banding, halos, or unnatural transitions between hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors in the suit and cape are vibrant and saturated, providing uniformity without any visible issues such as color banding, halos, or unnatural transitions. This is expected in high-quality digital illustrations where color application is smooth and even.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands of the character have exactly five fingers each, with natural-looking shapes and spacing, and are the arms and legs proportionally shortened without broken joints or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's hands are stylized in keeping with a chibi aesthetic, which means fingers are not portrayed realistically. Instead, they are simplified and rounded, fitting the overall exaggerated proportions of a chibi character. The arms and legs are proportionally shortened, maintaining the style without broken joints or unnatural bending.",
