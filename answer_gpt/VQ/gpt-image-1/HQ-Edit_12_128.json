      "question": "Does the frosted crystal frame preserve the original carved details (such as the floral crest and side columns) without warping or flattening the shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the frosted crystal frame of the clock retains intricate details such as floral crests and side columns. These details are well-defined and have not been warped or flattened, as shown by the clarity of the carvings despite the frosted or translucent material. The frame maintains the original ornate design elements noted in image A, indicating no loss of structural integrity or artistic detail. World knowledge about crystal and ornamentation suggests that intricacy can be maintained through fine craftsmanship, which appears to be the case here.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Roman numerals etched into the crystal face evenly spaced, legible, and aligned with the original hour positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing image B, the Roman numerals on the crystal face appear to be evenly spaced, legible, and well aligned with the original positions noted in image A. The crystal material does not obstruct readability, and the numerals retain distinct clarity, arranged around the clock face appropriately. Comparison with image A shows consistency in the placement and spacing of these numerals, affirming no distortion or misalignment due to the material change.",

      "question": "Is the faceted crystal pendulum symmetrically shaped, properly suspended by the chains, and free from floating or misaligned connections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal pendulum in image B is symmetrically shaped, which is evident through its even facets and balanced appearance. The suspension chains are correctly connecting the pendulum without it floating or showing misalignment, indicating proper attachment. Image A features a more ornate pendulum, yet in both images, the suspension mechanism remains consistent and visually correct. World knowledge on pendulum design suggests functionality relies on balanced suspension, which is maintained in image B.",

      "question": "Is the white marble wall uniformly textured, free from visible stitching or artificial boundaries, and does it cast soft, natural shadows beneath the clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a white marble wall with smooth, consistent texture. There are no visual signs of stitching or boundaries, suggesting a seamless surface typical of high-quality marble. Below the clock, soft shadows are cast, contributing to a natural appearance. World knowledge of marble surfaces and the interaction with light supports these observations, indicating a realistic depiction. Comparison with image A shows a different material backdrop but similar shadow interaction.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crystal components (frame, face, pendulum) visually integrated without noticeable gaps, material inconsistencies, or unnatural reflections at their junctions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal components in image B—frame, face, and pendulum—are visually integrated without visible gaps or inconsistencies in material. They are seamlessly connected, lacking unnatural reflections at junctions. This integration supports a realistic depiction of crystal design, typically known for clarity and cohesiveness. Image A shows wooden components, but both images demonstrate attention to detail in material integration, affirming the craftsmanship visible in image B.",
