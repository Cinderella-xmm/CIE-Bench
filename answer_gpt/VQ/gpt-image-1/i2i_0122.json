      "question": "Does the outdoor café table appear to have a natural wood texture and color, consistent with the existing glass cups?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the table appears to be made of metal with a darker color and smooth texture, inconsistent with a natural wood appearance. The glass cups rest on this metallic-looking table which contrasts with a wooden texture. Based on visual cues and common knowledge about café tables, this setting features a metal table which is not consistent with a natural wood texture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the snowy cabin in the background seamlessly integrated into the scene without noticeable edges or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowy cabin appears well-blended into the outdoor setting. The lighting and shadows around the cabin correspond naturally with the ambient light conditions, typically seen during sunset in snow-covered areas. There are no apparent edges or signs of artificial blending that disrupt the scene's harmony.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the reflections and shadows on the glasses match the lighting conditions of the new snowy cabin background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflections and shadows on the glasses in Image B are consistent with outdoor lighting conditions during a snowy sunset. The shadows cast by the glasses are angled appropriately, reflecting the low sun position typical in snowy landscapes. The lighting on the glasses and their reflections is coherent with the background setting and lighting direction.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sizes and proportional relationships between the two glasses and the outdoor café table natural and physically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sizes and proportions of the glasses relative to the table appear physically plausible. The glasses have a realistic size and are placed naturally on the table scene. Their size does not overwhelm the table nor seem disproportionately small, maintaining a believable scale in relation to typical café settings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the steam rising from the glasses look natural and consistent with the new outdoor café setting without any artificial interruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam in Image B rises gently from the glasses, consistent with typical visualization in cold outdoor environments where hot beverages contrast with the chilly air. The steam's appearance and movement correspond with natural physics and are not interrupted artificially, blending well with the setting.",
