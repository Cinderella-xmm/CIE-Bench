    "Question": "Q1: Do the arm-like appendages formed from the balconies maintain consistent proportions and smooth joints without jagged edges or unnatural bends?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the appendages resemble robotic arms, suggesting a transformation into a humanoid figure. These appendages appear consistent in proportions with smooth joints. They are constructed with intricate details common in robot design, avoiding jagged edges or unnatural bends typically found in traditional architectural structures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the glowing panels uniformly distributed across the window positions and do they emit light in a way that blends seamlessly with the surrounding surfaces without harsh halos or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "Image B features glowing panels integrated into the mechanical design of the robotic figure, possibly mimicking window arrangements. The glowing panels emit a warm light uniformly, integrating seamlessly with the structure without harsh halos or pixelation, which aligns with design elements commonly found in advanced robotics or sci-fi art.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the circuit patterns run along plausible structural lines (e.g., edges, corners) and exhibit consistent thickness and color without appearing as random overlays or digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the circuit patterns on the robotic figure are designed to run along the structural lines such as edges and joints, which is coherent with anatomical and engineering principles in mechanical design. The patterns exhibit consistent thickness and color, avoiding the appearance of random overlays or digital artifacts typical in poorly executed edits.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the dynamic parts at the edges of the building connected to the main structure through visible mechanical links, and do they follow realistic pivot points without floating or misaligned components?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows mechanical components with visible links, suggesting an advanced robotics design. These components are connected realistically to the main structure through proper pivot points, ensuring they do not appear floating or misaligned, adhering to believable mechanical design principles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the exposed gears positioned at structural junctions and scaled appropriately relative to the buildingâ€™s height and width, without appearing oversized or misaligned with surrounding features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gears and mechanical components are positioned well, respecting structural junctions typical of robotics. They are scaled appropriately, maintaining proportionate relationships with the overall design. This avoids the appearance of oversized or misaligned features that could detract from the intended sci-fi aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
