      "question": "Are the stripes on the zebra consistent with its natural patterns without appearing as unnatural or disjointed lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is depicted as a simplified cartoon character. Its stripes are stylized and consistent with the cartoon aesthetic, which is different from the complex and naturally random patterns seen on actual zebras. Naturally, zebra stripes are unique and vary significantly, whereas Image B's stripes follow a uniform pattern suited to illustrative design rather than natural randomness.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the zebra's ears maintain their natural upright position without any distortion or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's ears are depicted in a front-facing, upright cartoon style, which is common in these kinds of designs. Although they are positioned in the typical upward fashion, they are designed in a simplistic and exaggerated cartoon manner, differing from the actual curvature and details of real zebra ears.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the zebra maintain realistic proportions in its limbs and body, avoiding any grossly exaggerated or distorted features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is drawn as a cartoon character with proportions that are deliberately exaggerated to create a cute and playful look. The features such as the head and body are disproportionate compared to a real zebra, aiming for stylization rather than realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the texture of the zebra's coat smooth and free of unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a cartoon zebra, which inherently lacks the realistic texture seen in real animals. Its coat is represented by solid colors and lines, typical of illustrations, not permitting the natural fur texture and gradient we would expect in an actual zebra. Thus, the coat texture is smooth but not in the sense of realistic animal fur.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the grass around the zebra unaltered and free of any editing artifacts, maintaining its natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depicted grass is highly simplified and part of the cartoon design, which inherently means it does not match the natural look and complexity seen in real grass as in Image A. The grass is illustrative, supporting the stylized and minimalistic cartoon design.",
