    "Question": "Q3: Are the kimono panels clearly separated into distinct layers with clean edges and no overlapping or floating segments that suggest improper layering?",
    "explanation": "The kimono in Image B is depicted in a layered papercraft style. Each panel and layer is distinctly separated with clean edges, characteristic of cut paper designs. The design avoids any overlap or floating segments, which would indicate improper layering. Instead, the layers give a sense of depth and are crafted to emphasize the multi-dimensional aspect of the artwork.",

    "Question": "Q4: Do the gold foil elements exhibit consistent reflectivity and blend naturally with the surrounding floral pattern without harsh highlights or floating fragments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold foil elements are integrated into the floral patterns on the kimono. They exhibit a consistent sheen that suggests reflectivity and blend naturally with the paper medium, avoiding harsh highlights that could occur in digital rendering. The elements are smoothly incorporated into the design, without any indication of floating fragments or inconsistencies with the pattern.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the detachable panels aligned with natural fold lines or garment seams and do they appear securely attached without floating or intersecting incorrectly with adjacent clothing parts?",
    "explanation": "The detachable panels in Image B, related to the kimono design, follow the natural fold lines and seams common in traditional kimono designs. They are precisely aligned and appear securely attached, avoiding any floating appearance or improper intersection with neighboring parts. Such careful alignment is typical in a papercraft illustration, ensuring that each piece contributes to the overall integrity of the garment's structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
