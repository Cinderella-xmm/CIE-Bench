      "question": "Do the Lego bricks representing the cobblestone path maintain a natural appearance without introducing obvious unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cobblestone path is represented by LEGO bricks, which are known for their uniform shape and texture. The visual representation shows an orderly arrangement of bricks, mimicking the pattern found in cobblestones. The smooth texture and consistent pattern of the LEGO bricks do not introduce unnatural textures beyond what is typical for a LEGO setup.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Lego brick structures of the buildings coherent and visually credible, without any broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings are constructed using LEGO bricks. These blocks are designed for interlocking to create structures, and the image shows well-aligned and consistent shapes forming the buildings. The absence of broken lines or disjointed shapes suggests coherency and visual credibility in the LEGO diorama.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the man's figure in the Lego diorama retain proper proportions and physical rationality, avoiding unnatural body shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO figure, which follows the standard LEGO mini-figure proportions: a blocky, simplified representation of a human form. Despite the abstraction inherent in LEGO figures, the proportions are consistent with conventional LEGO art, maintaining physical rationality within this context and avoiding any peculiar or unnatural features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the man's clothing and accessories been preserved in the Lego diorama without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figure’s clothing is depicted with the typical simplistic LEGO style. Details like the jacket and hat are simplified but recognizable, and the briefcase is presented with minimal detail, typical of LEGO accessories. There are no signs of unnatural artifacts that deviate from the expected LEGO aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the briefcase in the Lego diorama appear natural with correct ergonomics, lines, and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figure’s hand is designed in the typical LEGO fashion, meant to grasp objects like a briefcase with a simple, curved, U-shape. This conforms to the standardized ergonomics of LEGO figures, maintaining their intended aesthetic and functional design. Despite the abstraction, the hand appears natural within the context of LEGO figures.",
