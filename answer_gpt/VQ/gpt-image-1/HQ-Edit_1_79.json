      "question": "Are the fingers in the central panel positioned naturally over the book page, with no unnatural bending, extra joints, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fingers are depicted as sketched art featuring smooth and natural curves, which resemble typical human hand positions when interacting with a book. The placement and orientation are consistent with how fingers commonly rest on a page, and there are no indications of extra joints or distorted forms typical in drawing errors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hand on the left panel transition into a tree branch with a smooth, continuous shape, maintaining five fingers and no abrupt geometric breaks or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left panel illustrates a conceptual transition of a hand into a tree branch. The transformation maintains an organic flow, appearing smooth and continuous. While the hand does morph into a branch with fewer than five distinguishable fingers, the concept is executed without abrupt geometric breaks, aligning with artistic visualization rather than anatomical accuracy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the floral embellishments on the right side of the bench attached to the wooden surface without floating or misalignment, and do they have consistent lighting and shadow direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right panel of Image B shows floral decorations integrated into the scene, placed against a drawing of a wooden bench. The flowers appear coherently and are blended into the environment without signs of misalignment or appearing detached, with harmonious lighting that maintains a sense of consistency throughout the illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the edges of the card panels display a natural leaf pattern with soft texture and color blending, without pixelation or unnatural line work?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the card panels are illustrated with artistic leaf motifs. These elements display soft textures and smoothly blended colors, characteristic of high-quality drawings, with no visible pixelation or unnatural line work disrupting the overall aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the three panels aligned horizontally across the image, with consistent size and spacing, and do they sit within the frame without overlapping or distorting the original subject or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a triptych arrangement with three panels aligned horizontally. They appear evenly sized and spaced, fitting cohesively within the image frame. There is no visual distortion caused by overlapping elements, ensuring the central subject and surrounding artistic components are unobstructed and clearly presented.",
