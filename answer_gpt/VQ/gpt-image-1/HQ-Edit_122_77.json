      "question": "Do the vine-like tendrils follow the natural contour of the head without floating or breaking apart at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vine-like tendrils appear to flow naturally from the head, following the contour without any visible separation or unnatural floating. The continuity and integration of these tendrils with the rest of the hair structure ensure they do not break apart at the edges. This suggests well-executed alignment and attachment, consistent with the natural flow and growth pattern of vines.",
