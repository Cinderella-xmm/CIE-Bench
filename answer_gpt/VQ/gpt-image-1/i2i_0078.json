      "question": "Are there any visible seams or unnatural edges where the watch meets the new steampunk-style background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch appears to be seamlessly integrated into the steampunk-style train station background, with no visible seams or unnatural edges. The blending of the focus and the color grading is consistent, suggesting professional editing techniques have been employed. The convergence of shadows and reflections around the watch base also indicates that no sharp or artificial transitions exist. This analysis considers the visual integration rules in photographic compositions.",

      "question": "Does the wristwatch retain its original proportions, geometric shapes, and fine details without distortion in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the wristwatch retains the correct proportions, geometric shapes, and fine details consistent with what would be a well-maintained visual representation of a high-quality watch. The symmetry, circular dial, and the even links in the band remain intact. The original detailing like numeral markings and watch hands appear unaltered and sharp. World knowledge about how such edits respecting product integrity rules works supports this assessment.",

      "question": "Do the textures and finishes on the watch's metal band and face appear natural and detailed, matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metal band and face of the wristwatch exhibit a natural sheen and texture typical of a polished metal surface, which aligns perfectly with expectations of luxury watch finishes. The level of detail, including reflections and subtle highlights, suggests careful attention to preserving realism. When compared to Image A, these aspects remain consistent, indicating no degradation in texture or finish quality post-editing. This conclusion is drawn from understanding material rendering and photographic consistency.",

      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the wristwatch match the light sources in the new steampunk-style train station background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the watch appears consistent with the ambient warm light sources of the steampunk-style train station. Shadows are cast appropriately considering the numerous light sources visible in the background, matching their direction. This suggests careful adjustment of light settings to maintain coherence between the watch and the surrounding setting. This evaluation is based on the alignment of natural lighting principles in photography.",

      "question": "Have the original lighting and shadows around the watch been preserved without introducing unrealistic contrasts or overly bright/dark areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the lighting and shadows around the watch appear well-balanced, without introducing unrealistic contrasts or overly bright/dark areas. The tonal gradients and transitional lighting effects have been maintained, as would be expected in a naturally lit environment. Comparing to Image A, there is no sign of introduced harsh or soft lighting discrepancies, suggesting skilled preservation of the original lighting setup. The assessment leverages knowledge of photographic lighting techniques.",
