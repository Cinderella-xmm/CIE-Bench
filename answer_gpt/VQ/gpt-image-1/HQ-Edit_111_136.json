      "question": "Does the white chiton with gold accents on the woman’s body show natural fabric folds and lighting consistency, without visible pixelation, texture repetition, or unnatural stiffness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chiton design is based on classical Greek pottery art, with a focus on simplicity and stylization rather than the realistic depiction of fabric folds. The chiton shows smooth lines typical of such art styles, rather than naturalistic fabric folds. The absence of pixelation and unnatural stiffness aligns with the artistic tradition it draws from.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the classical Greek-style waves and laurel leaves in the woman's hair consistent in shape, density, and lighting with the surrounding environment, and do they avoid unnatural clumping or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waves and laurel leaves in Image B are rendered in the stylized manner typical of Greek pottery, where elements are often depicted in simplified forms. This stylistic choice affects the elements of density and consistency, and these factors are appropriately matched with the ancient art style and the depicted background.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trees and animals in the background retain recognizable forms while being rendered in a golden, stylized manner consistent with classical Greek pottery art, without distorted proportions or fragmented geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a stylized depiction of trees and animals, maintaining recognizable forms while adhering to the simplified, golden-toned aesthetics of classical Greek pottery. This approach avoids distorted proportions and fragmented geometry, adhering to the standards of the art style.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky rendered with coherent cloud formations and directional lighting that matches the overall illumination of the scene, avoiding artificial seams or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky features dramatic cloud formations that are consistent with the artistic style of Greek pottery art. The lighting matches the overall scene's illumination, with the absence of artificial seams or inconsistent shading as typical in such artwork where lighting is abstract rather than realistic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the woman’s hands and feet anatomically correct, with five fingers per hand and natural joint positioning, and does her posture reflect plausible human motion without deformation or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the woman’s hands and feet following the conventions of ancient Greek pottery art, prioritizing form and balance over anatomical exactness. While the stylization may exaggerate or simplify, it avoids obvious errors such as deformation or misplaced joints, reflecting plausible human motion within its artistic norms.",
