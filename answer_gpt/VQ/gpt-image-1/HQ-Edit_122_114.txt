    "Question": "Q1: Are the cogs and gears forming the nest properly aligned and interlocked, showing no visible gaps or floating elements that break geometric continuity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cogs and gears fit together seamlessly, forming the nest structure around the mechanical stork. These elements are interlocked and align well without visible gaps or inconsistencies that break the flow of the design. Cogs and gears are designed to work in unison to transfer motion effectively, and their precise alignment is crucial for functionality. Observing the image, the mechanical elements appear meshed in the correct manner, akin to how they would be in a functional machine.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the copper pipes run along the roof edges in a physically plausible manner, with consistent thickness and no abrupt bends or floating sections?",
    "explanation": "The copper pipes in Image B run along the house roof edges, following a path consistent with typical architectural designs where pipes are often used to channel fluids or cables. The pipes in this image maintain a consistent thickness throughout their lengths and make bends at angles that are smooth, avoiding any abrupt or unnatural curvature. Additionally, there are no indications of floating sections; each pipe seems to be anchored or integrated into the structure, providing a believable visual implementation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the metallic plates covering the stork’s body arranged in a way that follows the underlying anatomy, without unnatural overlaps or gaps between plates?",
    "explanation": "The metallic plates on the stork in Image B are arranged to mimic the anatomical structure of a bird, following the contours of the stork's body. Each plate appears to be positioned to allow for the natural extension and contraction that a bird would require. There are no notable gaps or overlaps that suggest unnatural arrangement, indicating a thoughtful design that respects the organic shape while employing a mechanical aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the mechanical joints at the stork’s neck, wing, and leg connections properly shaped and positioned to match the movement range of a real bird, without appearing distorted or misplaced?",
    "explanation": "In the image, the mechanical joints of the stork are designed to replicate the mobility found in a real bird. They are placed strategically at the neck, wing, and leg areas, where articulation is necessary. Each joint is sized and aligned to allow rotational and tilting movements equivalent to organic joints, considering the physics of avian mobility. The image shows no distortion or unnatural positioning of these joints, affirming a well-engineered artificial design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the integration of mechanical elements (cogs, pipes) with the wooden house maintain proportional harmony and avoid elements that appear disproportionately large or suspended without support?",
    "explanation": "The mechanical elements of Image B, including cogs and pipes, are proportionally integrated with the wooden structure of the house. The scale of each element is reasonable and corresponds well with one another, creating an aesthetic balance between the machinery and the traditional architecture. Each piece seems to sit firmly within the composition, avoiding the visual discordance of floating or unsupported parts. This careful integration suggests a conscious effort to blend the mechanical and natural elements seamlessly, ensuring a harmonious appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
