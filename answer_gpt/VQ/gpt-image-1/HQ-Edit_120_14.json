    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cogwheel joints clearly defined, aligned with the frame's geometry, and rendered with consistent metallic texture and shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical insect features several cogwheel joints prominently displayed along its legs. The consistent metallic texture and shading suggest a cohesive design and attention to detail in rendering, with the alignment adhering to the geometry of the mechanical frame. There is a meticulous representation of gears connected logically, enhancing the realism of the insect's design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the carapace-shaped seat have detailed surface textures, proper curvature, and seamless attachment to the seat post without visible seams or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a traditional bicycle seat, there is a carapace-like structure forming the body of the insect. The surface textures are intricately detailed with decorative engravings, and the curvature is fluid, suggesting a seamless attachment to the insect’s body. This creates a polished appearance without visible seams or warping.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the mechanical legs have realistic hinge mechanisms, correct proportions, and no overlapping or misplaced segments that break spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases mechanical legs with articulated joints and hinges that appear realistic. The proportions are consistent and thoughtfully constructed within the body’s design, contributing to spatial logic. The segments are placed correctly, avoiding overlap that would otherwise disrupt the perceived functionality of the design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wingtips smoothly attached to the top tube, showing consistent copper coloring, reflective properties, and no jagged edges or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B appear to emanate smoothly from the insect's body, consistent with its metallic design. The copper color of these wings is uniform, and the reflective properties are consistently applied across the surface. There are no jagged edges or signs of texture repetition, ensuring a polished and coherent visual presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the clock faces clearly visible, properly embedded in the handlebars, and free from texture artifacts, incorrect lighting, or distorted numerals/runes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face (located in the head region of the insect) is distinct and incorporated into its design, diverging from traditional handlebars. The clock face is prominent, with numerals clearly visible and lighting properly showcasing its placement without distortion or artifacts. This design choice integrates elegantly within the overall appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do all newly added mechanical elements (legs, joints, wings, clocks) share consistent material properties, such as metallic sheen, color tone, and surface imperfections, without abrupt visual breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical elements within Image B, such as legs, joints, wings, and the clock, display a unified metallic sheen, consistent color tone, and similar surface characteristics. These features blend seamlessly into the overall design, showcasing a thoughtful approach to maintaining visual consistency and cohesion without disruptive elements.",
