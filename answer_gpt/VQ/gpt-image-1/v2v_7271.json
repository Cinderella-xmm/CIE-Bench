      "question": "Are the brick textures and shapes of the building and the \"LAUNDROMAT\" sign consistent with Lego bricks, without introducing unnatural artifacts or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brick textures and the 'LAUNDROMAT' sign have a clear Lego-like appearance. The bricks are uniform in size and shape, and the sign has distinct blocky edges that resemble typical Lego brick shapes. There are no visible artifacts, and the design retains the fine details expected in a Lego-styled environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the person holding the laundry appear naturally integrated into the Lego-style environment without any visible distortion or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The person in Image B is designed to look like a Lego figure, with simplified blocky shapes and joints typical of Lego characters. The integration into the environment is smooth, with no visible distortions or blending issues, making the figure appear as part of the overall Lego-style composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the washing machines and interior elements inside the laundromat look like they are made of Lego bricks, preserving their structural integrity and avoiding broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the washing machines and interior are composed of distinct Lego-style blocks, with a clear geometric structure typical of Lego designs. The structural integrity of the elements is preserved, with no broken shapes, making them closely resemble real Lego creations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stack of folded laundry held by the person retain its natural appearance and texture, without appearing as if it is made of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stack of folded laundry does not retain a natural textile appearance and clearly follows the blocky aesthetic of Lego bricks. The laundry appears as a stack of rectangular, blocky shapes, indicative of Lego construction, rather than smooth, natural fabric.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the scene, including the person, the laundry, and the laundromat, coherent and visually plausible as a stop-motion diorama crafted in the style of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition in Image B is coherent and visually aligns with the Lego brick style. The environment, person, and prop elements all adhere to the blocky, geometric Lego aesthetic, creating a plausible stop-motion diorama effect that is visually consistent.",
