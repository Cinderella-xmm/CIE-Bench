    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the figure's raised leg and upper arm maintain continuous, smooth curvature without sharp breaks or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure displays a smooth curvature in both the raised leg and upper arm. The lines are continuous, which is typical in illustrations where fluid motion is emphasized. This indicates a careful design choice to represent grace and flexibility associated with yoga positions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tones are unified, as indicated by the warm color palette shared by the sky, sand, and figure's clothing. The use of consistent warm tones that blend harmoniously reflects a coherent design, enhancing the peaceful atmosphere typical of serene beach settings.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the angle between the neck and torso consistent with human flexibility, and do the extended arms show smooth, uninterrupted lines without kinks or bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a realistic pose for a yoga practitioner, with the neck and torso angle consistent with human flexibility. The arms are depicted as smooth, uninterrupted lines, showcasing an understanding of proportion and movement, typical of illustrations focused on yoga poses.",

      "question": "Do the textures on the figure’s skin and clothing show consistent shading and fine detail without visible pixelation or smeared regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure’s skin and clothing in Image B display consistent shading with smooth blending, avoiding any pixelation or smearing. This reflects a well-rendered illustration that maintains the quality typically expected in vector or high-resolution digital art.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the foot have exactly five fingers, each with natural curvature and proper contact with the foot, without overlapping or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand appears to be correctly formed with five fingers, each curving naturally and making proper contact with the foot. This suggests the artist's attention to anatomical accuracy and detail, crucial for realistic depiction in art.",
      "weight": 1,

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadow in Image B is aligned with the sun’s position, tapering naturally toward the horizon. This is consistent with realistic shadow behavior, reflecting an understanding of lighting and perspective in visual art.",
