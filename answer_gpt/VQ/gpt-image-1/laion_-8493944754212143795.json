      "question": "Does the shimmering mane formed from the water maintain fluid motion and transparency consistent with the original waterfall, without appearing solid or rigid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's mane is depicted as flowing smoothly, resembling the fluidity and movement of water typical in a waterfall. The visual cues indicate a transparent and dynamic motion, similar to the natural water flow observed in Image A. The mane in Image B does not appear solid or rigid, carrying the traits of water motion found in waterfalls.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scale patterns on the transformed rock body seamlessly integrated with the original stone texture, without visible seams, unnatural repetition, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon’s body appears with scales that are neatly integrated into the original texture, creating a natural continuation of the stone surface seen in Image A. Each scale is placed consistently with no visible seams, distortion, or repetition, suggesting a smooth transition from the stone texture to the scaled body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cloud wings formed from the foam extend naturally from the dragon’s body and align with the direction of water movement, without appearing detached or floating unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foam flows into cloud-like wings that appear seamlessly joined to the dragon's form. The wings extend naturally, following the water's direction, similar to how foam might move and change in the waterfall seen in Image A. The wings do not seem detached but are integrated smoothly with the dragon, maintaining the natural alignment of water movement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing blue runes embedded into the scales with smooth, diffused light emission and no sharp edges or unnatural brightness that disrupts the surrounding texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing blue runes are integrated into the scales on the dragon’s body. The runes emit a smooth and diffused light, avoiding harsh edges and overly bright sections that might disrupt the continuity of the scales' texture. The light from the runes appears well-balanced within the dragon design, suggesting an even integration.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dragon’s body and wings match the direction and intensity of natural sunlight in the original scene, without conflicting illumination or floating highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the dragon with shadows and highlights that are consistent with the subtle lighting seen in Image A. The illumination aligns with the natural sunlight direction perceived in the original waterfall, ensuring coherence in the light intensity and direction on both the body and wings. There are no floating highlights that conflict with the scene's natural lighting.",
