      "question": "Does the sparrow maintain its natural proportions and texture details without appearing overly stylized or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow appears highly stylized, taking on a more animated or cartoon-like appearance, which is characterized by exaggerated eyes and simplified texture details. This differs from a natural representation, where a sparrow would have more realistic proportions and detailed feather texture. The prominent size of the eyes and the smooth texture of the feathers contribute to this stylized depiction. Therefore, it loses the fine details characteristic of a natural sparrow.",

      "question": "Does the sparrow appear to be perched naturally on the wooden chair without any distortion or unnatural positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow is sitting on the top of the chair, and there is no indication of distortion or unnatural positioning. It is perched in a stable manner that one would expect from a bird resting on a chair, which suggests a natural position. Although the sparrow is stylized, its placement and posture relative to the chair are appropriate and do not indicate any imbalance or distortion.",

      "question": "Does the wooden chair exhibit realistic wood grain and texture without any unnatural artifacts or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair appears smoother and more stylized than a real wooden chair would. It lacks the detailed wood grain and texture one would expect from natural wood. Real wood would usually show more varied lines and imperfections, contributing to its texture. The appearance of the chair in Image B is consistent with a stylized depiction, focusing more on overall shape and color rather than realistic grain details.",

      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the sparrow and the chair consistent and natural, contributing to the overall realism of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the stylized appearance of the sparrow and the chair, the lighting and shadows are consistent across the scene. The lighting highlights the features of the sparrow and chair appropriately, and shadows fall where they naturally would given this setup, maintaining consistency. The light source seems uniform, which supports a realistic look in terms of lighting, even if the textures are stylized.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the sparrow and the chair look visually credible and undistorted in the 3D-rendered depiction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition and layout in Image B feature the sparrow perched on the chair in a balanced manner, which makes the scene visually credible. Despite the stylization of each element, the positioning and proportions within the scene are correct and do not exhibit distortion. Thus, the overall arrangement appears logical and well-rendered in terms of spatial relationships.",
