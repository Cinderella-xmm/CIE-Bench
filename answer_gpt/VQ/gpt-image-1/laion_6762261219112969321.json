    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the cloud textures on the seat, backrest, and armrests appear soft, layered, and continuous without flat or blocky regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cloud textures resemble fluffy and soft clouds, typically depicting cumulus clouds. The layers are intricately designed, smoothly transitioning into one another, creating a continuous and seamless appearance. Such textures commonly indicate softness and continuity, characteristic of well-drawn clouds. There are no visually discernible flat or blocky regions, which confirms the coherence and naturalistic appearance of the clouds.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the wooden frame and legs replaced with branching, flowing wind-like structures that follow natural fluid motion without sharp angles or rigid breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, compared to the traditional wooden frame and legs observed in Image A, the supporting structures have been transformed into elements resembling wispy clouds or flowing wind. These structures are depicted with smooth, curving, and swirling motion patterns, emulating a dynamic and natural flow similar to wind or fluid movement. There are no abrupt angles or breaks, maintaining the elegance and fluidity throughout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned on the upper cushions with smooth integration into the cloud texture, lacking jagged edges or unnatural color contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays large, rounded eyes embedded within the cloud textures on the sofa's upper cushions. These eyes are smoothly incorporated into the clouds, with seamless borders that fit naturally into the overall design. The integration appears harmonious, with no jarring edges or color dissimilarities that would disrupt the cohesion of the clouds.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the mist trail extend continuously from the back of the sofa with consistent texture and fading intensity, without sudden breaks or unnatural boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mist trails develop smoothly from the sofa's back, with an organic and consistent texture. The transition from dense to light mist is gradual, lacking any abrupt discontinuities or unnatural demarcations. This suggests a continuous, flowing trail, maintaining unity with the sofa's cloud theme.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall structure of the sofa preserved with proper alignment between the seat, backrest, arms, and base, without visible gaps, overlaps, or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the sofa has transformed into a fantastical cloud representation, its functional alignment remains intact. The seat, backrest, and arms, though visually portrayed as parts of clouds, are consistently aligned with no evident misalignment, gaps, or overlaps. The structure maintains a coherent form, suggesting a deliberate design rather than an arbitrary abstraction.",
