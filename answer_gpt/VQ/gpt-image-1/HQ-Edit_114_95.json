    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass-like surface of the transformed Eiffel Tower show natural transparency and subtle reflections consistent with real glass under overcast lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed Eiffel Tower in Image B exhibits a surface resembling glass, with a level of transparency that reveals the interior structure. The overcast lighting is soft, which would typically cause subdued reflections on a glass surface due to its diffusive nature. The reflections observed are subtle and consistent with what would be expected under such conditions, lending authenticity to the glass-like appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the embossed patterns on the glass surface aligned with the original lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower and proportionally consistent across all levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass surface of the Eiffel Tower retains an embossed pattern that mimics the original lattice design. The patterns appear proportionally consistent with the actual structure of the Eiffel Tower, maintaining alignment throughout its levels, which indicates attention to detail in comparison to traditional design elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold-plated base positioned correctly at the bottom of the tower, with smooth edges and consistent metallic texture that matches the scale and lighting of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold-plated base in Image B is located at the bottom of the transformed structure. It features smooth, consistent edges and a metallic texture that reflects the soft lighting characteristic of the overcast scene. The gold coloring and shiny quality are correctly portrayed, matching the overall scale and aesthetic of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Parisian skyline motif visible along the glass surface without distorting the towerâ€™s shape or appearing as a floating or disconnected element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Parisian skyline depicted along the glass surface of Image B is visible without causing distortion to the tower's shape. It integrates seamlessly with the design, appearing as part of the overall structure rather than a separate or floating element, which enhances the overall harmony of the design.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the logo at the neck of the bottle clearly defined, centered, and free from jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo positioned at the neck of the bottle is well-defined and centered. The clarity of the design is maintained without any jagged edges or noticeable texture artifacts, which contributes to a polished and professional appearance of the design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the main structural elements of the tower (legs, arches, central column) preserved in correct proportion and alignment, with no signs of stretching or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed tower in Image B retains all main structural elements, including legs, arches, and central column. These elements are proportionately preserved, maintaining proper alignment without noticeable geometric distortion or stretching, indicating a faithful representation of the original structure's integrity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as pixelation, color bleeding, or unnatural reflections around the transformed tower or its components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, there are no visible signs of pixelation, color bleeding, or unnatural reflections present around the transformed tower or its components. The image appears clear and well-rendered, ensuring a high-quality visual outcome.",
