      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D soccer player appear to blend seamlessly with the realistic soccer field and stadium without any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style player has exaggerated and cartoon-like proportions typical of chibi characters, which stand out against the realistic background of the soccer field and stadium. The background, maintaining its realistic depiction, contrasts with the stylized figure. Despite this stylistic difference, there are no jarring artifacts or inconsistencies at the interface between the character and the background scene, suggesting a technically competent blend within the constraints of differing styles.",

      "question": "Are the soccer field, stadium, and cheering crowd still visually plausible and structurally coherent, without any distortions or unnatural textures introduced by the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer field, stadium, and cheering crowd have been preserved with their realistic appearances. There are no signs of editing that distort these elements and no unnatural textures have been introduced that compromise their visual coherence or structural plausibility in the context of a soccer match setting.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D soccer player maintain proper proportions and physical logic, avoiding any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a chibi-style soccer player, which inherently features stylized proportions such as a larger head and smaller body. However, these proportions are consistent with the typical chibi design philosophy, which does not result in any distorted or broken geometric shapes. The player's shape seems intentional and coherent within the chibi design style, aligning with expected chibi aesthetics rather than realistic physical logic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the chibi-style 3D soccer player look natural and free of any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures and materials of the chibi-style player appear smooth and stylized, as is standard for chibi representations. The textures are clean, with no visible artifacts such as pixelation or awkward blending, and the materials used for the clothing and other surfaces are consistent with a cartoon-like character design, looking intentional rather than natural in a realistic sense.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the action pose of the chibi-style 3D soccer player consistent with the original image, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the original player is in an action-packed pose consistent with kicking a soccer ball. Image B replicates this pose in the chibi style, maintaining the dynamic positioning of limbs and body orientation. While the chibi proportions are different, the overall pose retains structural consistency and visual credibility in representing a similar action scene.",
