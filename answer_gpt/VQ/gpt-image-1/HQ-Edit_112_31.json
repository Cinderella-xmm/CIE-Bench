    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the horseâ€™s head enlarged proportionally so that facial features like the eyes and muzzle remain clearly defined and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush horse has a head much larger than proportional to its body, which is typical for a chibi or plush toy. The eyes are oversized and cartoon-like with exaggerated features, typical of plush toys. The muzzle is minimalistic, not distorted, and clearly defined, maintaining a consistent style of toy design. This indicates that the enlargement of the head is intentional for stylization purposes, keeping facial features clear and undistorted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the body of the plush horse display a consistent fabric texture with soft, non-reflective surfaces and no abrupt transitions between color regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a plush horse where the fabric texture appears soft and consistent, being non-reflective as expected for a plush toy. The color transitions are smooth, without any abrupt or jarring changes between regions, providing a cohesive appearance associated with well-crafted toy design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes and mouth of the plush horse depicted with visible stitching patterns and raised texture consistent with embroidery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and mouth of the plush horse appear smooth and simple, with a flat application without any visible raised stitching or embroidery textures. Typically, plush toys sometimes use embroidery for facial features, but in this instance, the features are likely printed or made from flat fabric patches without distinct raised patterns.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the legs of the plush horse appear short and thick with smooth, rounded shapes and no distorted or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the plush horse with legs that are short and thick, which aligns with the common design of a plush toy. The shapes are smooth and rounded, maintaining an appearance free of distortion or broken geometry, contributing to a cohesive and stable structure typical of plush toys.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dandelions in the foreground composed of flat, circular felt-like discs on straight stems, lacking naturalistic detail or depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dandelions are stylized such that they consist of simple, flat circular discs atop straight stems that resemble felt. This simplistic representation lacks the naturalistic detail or depth found in real flowers, indicating a stylized approach typical in crafted or toy-like settings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the forest background rendered as a flat, untextured plane with no depth cues such as overlapping trees or atmospheric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background that consists of stylized, flat shapes representing trees. There is no sign of overlapping elements, shadows, or any atmospheric perspective that would indicate depth. This is consistent with a flat, untextured depiction seen in toy or model settings, which prioritizes simplicity.",
