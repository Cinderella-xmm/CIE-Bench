      "question": "Do the proportions of the shirt and tie appear natural and appropriate for the baby's body size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the proportions of the shirt and tie seem to fit the individual seated, matching the typical dimensions expected for an adult wearing business attire. In an adult, the shirt and tie are expected to align with the body shape and size, showing proportional adjustments for comfort and fit. Comparison with the infant in Image A shows a notable difference in proportions, where the shirt and tie were notably oversized, demonstrating a clear contrast in size and fit.",

      "question": "Are the textures of the shirt and tie smooth and consistent with typical fabric materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt and tie exhibit a consistent, smooth texture that corresponds well with typical fabric materials. The light reflects evenly across the surface, suggesting materials like cotton or polyester, commonly used in business attire. This is consistent with how fabric should appear in a professional studio photograph. Such textures in clothing are expected to be uniform and wrinkle-free, matching conventional fabric textures.",

      "question": "Do the baby's hands holding the glasses appear anatomically correct and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands holding the glasses appear to be from an adult rather than a baby, suggesting a correct and proportionate alignment for an adult individual. The fingers grip the glasses naturally, and there are no visible distortions or unnatural positions expected in an adult's anatomical structure. This consistency with expected adult hand anatomy indicates a lack of distortion.",

      "question": "Does the baby's posture and the way the clothes drape over the body look natural and believable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an adult seated comfortably on a couch, dressed in a well-fitted business suit. The posture appears natural with an appropriate drape of the clothing over the body, consistent with a tailored fit. This is in contrast to children's clothing, where overgrown proportions can lead to bunching or unnatural folds.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit appears seamlessly integrated with the individual, with no visible signs of editing such as inconsistent edges or unnatural seams. The attire aligns perfectly with the person's body, with all parts fitting well, suggesting that the image is not edited but photographed with a naturally fitting outfit.",
