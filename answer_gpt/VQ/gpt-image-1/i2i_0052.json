        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the chibi-fied players are illustrated in a simple and cartoonish style typical of chibi characters, which naturally includes simplified shapes and textures.

        "Yes",
        "No"

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows chibi characters holding tennis rackets and shaking hands, depicted with an emphasis on friendly interaction. Although the setting is more abstract without direct reference to a pastoral setting, the structure of the action is clear and not distorted, maintaining consistency in the context of a simple character illustration.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The semi-transparent court logo in Image B is unobtrusive and does not overshadow the chibi characters. It's integrated in a way that complements the image aesthetically without causing any distraction or distortion, respecting the visual hierarchy where the characters are the focal point.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cohesive composition where chibi characters and the background are harmoniously integrated. The cartoonish style ensures that all elements are visually balanced, and the semi-transparent logo provides depth without disrupting the image’s overall balance.",
