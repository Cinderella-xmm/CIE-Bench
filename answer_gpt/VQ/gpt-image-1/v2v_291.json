      "question": "Do the hippo and rabbit maintain their natural proportions and structural consistency in the 3D cartoon design without any visible distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo and rabbit are stylized with oversized heads and large eyes, common in cartoon and chibi designs to convey cuteness and friendliness. These stylizations are deliberate and part of the artistic choice in cartooning, meaning they don't reflect natural proportions as found in real-life hippos and rabbits. Compared to Image A, where proportions are natural, the 3D design in Image B exhibits intentional distortions for artistic effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gentle lighting and cozy tones in the 3D design enhance the natural appearance of the hippo and rabbit without creating any unnatural highlights or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D design in Image B uses soft lighting and warm colors, typical in cartoon styles, which contribute to a welcoming and gentle atmosphere, fitting with the cute characterization of the animals. The lighting is deliberately soft and consistent without harsh shadows or highlights, aligning well with the idea of creating a comforting scene. Compared to Image A, where natural lighting is present, Image B focuses on aesthetic appeal rather than realistic lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the hippo's skin texture and the rabbit's fur preserved in the 3D design without any loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vision is simplified in a way typical of cartoon designs, with smooth surfaces and a lack of detailed textures. This is a stylistic choice aiming for a clean and simplified visual, typical for such cartoons. Natural textures aren't preserved as in Image A, where skin and fur details are visible, indicating a preference for artistic simplification over realistic detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the placement of the title banner and nameplate integrate seamlessly with the 3D design of the hippo and rabbit, maintaining visual credibility and not disrupting the harmony between the characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a title banner and nameplate, which fit well with the overall cartoon design, integrating effectively with the visual elements without disruption. These graphic elements complement the 3D characters aesthetically and contribute to the cohesive theme of the image. There is no comparable element in Image A, making the integration a unique aspect of Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the nature-inspired backdrop with earthy greens and rich tones blend naturally with the 3D design of the hippo and rabbit, avoiding any visual inconsistencies or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background with shades of green and earth tones typical of cartooning, creating a harmonious and pleasant setting that integrates well with the 3D character design. This aesthetic choice aims to maintain coherence in the cartoon style, ensuring congruity between the characters and their environment. The softer textures and colors enhance the overall design without introducing inconsistencies or contrasting effects, unlike the realistic setting in Image A.",
