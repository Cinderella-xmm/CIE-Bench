      "question": "Are the sugar-crusted armor details on the donut surfaces uniform and free from unnatural pixelation or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the doughnut characters are illustrated with a uniform sugar-crusted texture that appears to be similar across all depicted doughnuts. The style is consistent, and there is no visible evidence of pixelation or repeated patterns that would give an unnatural appearance. This analysis was done by observing the consistent style use and lack of error in the visual texture creation, indicating strong craftsmanship in illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the doughy limbs extend naturally from the donut bodies without distorting the circular shape or creating floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the doughnut characters have arms and legs that seamlessly extend from the main circular shape of the donut. The artist has managed to preserve the circular nature of the doughnuts, ensuring the limbs do not appear to be awkwardly attached or floating, which suggests a good understanding of anatomy and perspective.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the icing eyes placed within the visible surface area of each donut and aligned with the curvature of the dough, avoiding floating or misaligned features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The icing eyes on the donut characters in Image B are consistently placed in a manner that follows the curvature of the doughnut's surface. They do not appear to be detached or floating but rather integrated into the surface, suggesting the artist has effectively used perspective to align features correctly to maintain a believable character design.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the marshmallow spears and chocolate shields proportionate to the donut characters and correctly oriented as if being held or used?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates that the marshmallow spears and chocolate shields are proportionate to the size of the donut characters. The positioning and orientation suggest they are being actively used or held by the characters, maintaining a relationship in scale and position that contributes to the scene's coherence.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the coffee mug fortress positioned at a plausible scale and distance relative to the donut characters, without appearing unnaturally large or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coffee mug appears behind the group of donut characters, and its size and placement suggest a reasonable sense of scale and distance. The mug does not overshadow the characters inappropriately nor does it distort the spatial relationships in the illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the playful fonts legible and cleanly outlined, with no pixelation or color bleeding at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fonts used in Image B are sharply presented, with clear outlines and no signs of pixelation or color bleeding. The readability of the text is ensured by distinct font styling appropriate for a comic panel, maintaining a professional and polished appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two panels are well delineated with clear and defined borders. The alignment supports a natural and understandable progression from one panel to the next, allowing the narrative to be followed without any visual confusion. This suggests effective panel design commonly found in comics.",
