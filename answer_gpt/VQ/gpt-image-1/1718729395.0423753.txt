    "Question": "Q1: Does the angel's facial skin retain smooth, consistent texture and natural coloration without artificial halos, pixelation, or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "In the analysis of Image B, the entire face is blurred, which makes it impossible to evaluate the texture, consistency, or any unnatural elements within the facial area. Without visible features, one cannot confirm if the skin texture and coloration present any artifacts like pixelation or highlights. Therefore, based on the visible parts of the image other than the face, a conclusion about facial skin cannot be made.",
