    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the pyramidâ€™s steps transformed into armored segments with consistent thickness, alignment, and geometric integrity, without visible breaks or unnatural warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure has transformed into a creature with pyramid-like elements making up its body. The pyramid's steps have been reimagined as scales or armored segments on the creature's body. These segments maintain consistency in thickness and alignment, echoing the original architecture of the pyramid in Image A. The shapes are coherent and smoothly integrated into the creature's form, displaying no signs of warping or irregularity, suggesting a deliberate transformation while preserving the geometric integrity of the original steps.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the entrance at the top of the pyramid replaced with an eye-like structure that matches the stone material and scale, without abrupt texture changes or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the creature, which maintains pyramid-like features, displays a large eye-like structure where the entrance would typically be. This eye is made to blend with the surrounding stone material in color and texture, although it has a distinct appearance due to its function and form. There are no abrupt transitions or isolated elements that float or disrupt the continuity of the stone texture, indicating a smooth integration of the feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trees and foliage surrounding the pyramid transform into vine-like scales that follow natural growth patterns and maintain consistent texture and lighting, without unnatural sharp edges or disconnected patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction shows a creature adorned with vine-like patterns that might be interpreted as foliage. These patterns display a consistent texture and lighting throughout, simulating natural vine growth over surfaces. The transformation maintains coherence across the creature's body without showing sharp edges or patches that appear disconnected from the overall design, auguring a naturally blended adornment pertinent to its environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are ancient stone patterns preserved and integrated into the base of the pyramid-creature, maintaining continuity with original carvings and avoiding mismatched or floating decorative elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are ancient stone patterns visible around the base of the creature, echoing the style of the original pyramid's carvings. These patterns are incorporated smoothly into the base, maintaining continuity with what one might expect from ancient stonework. The design avoids any appearance of mismatch or elements that appear to float or seem disjointed from the rest of the structure, ensuring that all decorative elements are firmly grounded and consistent with the original aesthetic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the luminescent plants around the base emit soft, localized light that interacts realistically with the environment, without overexposed areas or unnatural color spillage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an inclusion of luminescent plants around the base of the creature. These plants emit a soft, gentle light that casts localized illumination upon nearby surfaces. The interaction of this light with the surrounding environment is crafted to be subtle, without creating overly bright or overexposed areas. The colors emanated blend naturally, staying within realistic expectations without creating unnatural spillage over the darker surroundings.",
