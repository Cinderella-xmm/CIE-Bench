      "question": "Do the transformed wings retain smooth, continuous petal shapes that follow natural curvature and avoid jagged or fragmented edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object's wings are transformed into petal-like shapes that are smooth and have continuous curves. These wings exhibit a natural flow, akin to real flower petals, which typically have unbroken and consistent edges. The natural curvature of flower petals tends to avoid jaggedness, contributing to a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leaf designs on the wings detailed, evenly distributed, and free from unnatural pixelation or repeating patterns that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed wings feature leaf designs with visible veins, which are detailed and add realism. The leaves are placed evenly along the wings, and there are no signs of pixelation or repeating patterns, which can indicate artificial enhancement or poor digital editing.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tendrils extending from the antennae curve smoothly and taper gradually, resembling natural plant growth rather than sharp, mechanical lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tendrils emanating from the antennae exhibit graceful curves and tapering at the ends. Such characteristics mimic natural plant tendrils, which often have soft curves rather than abrupt, linear shapes. The flow of these tendrils appears organic and fluid.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the small blossoms at the wing edges and foot similar in color, texture, and size to the surrounding flowers in the meadow, and do they attach seamlessly without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blossoms on the wing edges and foot in Image B match in hue and texture with the other flowers in the image, suggesting consistency with the surrounding environment. They are integrated without displaying disassociation, like floating or clipping, thus maintaining a natural appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the butterflyâ€™s body transformed into a straight, slender stalk that connects naturally to the head and base, with no visible breaks or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the creature has been transformed into a smooth, slender stalk that extends naturally from the head to the base. There are no signs of breaks or misaligned segments, and the transitions are seamless, resembling a plant stem.",
