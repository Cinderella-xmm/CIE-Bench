      "question": "Does the city skyline in the mirror maintain realistic lighting and contrast, matching the ambient light of the bathroom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the city skyline reflected in the mirror is a nighttime scene with illuminated buildings, which contrasts with the ambient lighting of the bathroom. The bathroom, as seen in the rest of the space, has warm lighting from the fixture above the mirror and natural lighting from the side window, indicating a daytime or early evening setting. Typically, a mirror reflection should match the external lighting conditions to appear realistic. Here, the night scene in the mirror contrasts with the lighter ambient light, suggesting a lack of realism in synchronization with the bathroom's lighting.",

      "question": "Are the textures and details in the city skyline clear and sharp, without unnatural blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details of the city skyline in the mirror seem sharp with distinguishable buildings and lights. The clarity of the high-rise structures and their lit windows suggest a high-quality image with good resolution. There is no visible blurring or pixelation that undermines the details' clarity, making the cityscape visually appealing and detailed.",

      "question": "Does the skyline fit perfectly within the mirror's frame without distorting the geometric shape or overflowing its borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, the city skyline is perfectly displayed within the mirror's frame. The image is well-contained within the mirror’s borders, with no distortion of the geometric shapes of the buildings; the framing is clean with a balanced composition. This indicates that the image was well-aligned to fit the mirror's space, respecting its boundaries.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the city skyline in the mirror complement the bathroom's interior without clashing with elements like the marble countertop or fixtures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elegant city skyline blends with the bathroom's sophisticated interior. The gold fixtures, marble countertop, and dark vase complement the luxurious and modern feel that the cityscape projects. The colors and themes do not clash—instead, they create a harmonious aesthetic that integrates the urban scene with the bathroom decor.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the original bathroom elements around the mirror (such as the light above and objects on the countertop) unaffected and retain their natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all elements outside the mirror remain consistent with their appearance in Image A. The light fixture above the mirror, along with the soap dispensers and vase on the countertop, maintains its position and natural appearance, showing no signs of editing or altered lighting and shadow effects. This suggests that the mirrored image insertion did not affect the surrounding bathroom elements.",
