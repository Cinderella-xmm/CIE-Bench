      "question": "Do the hands and arms of both individuals maintain natural proportions and shapes without appearing distorted or having unnatural numbers of fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individuals' hands and arms appear complete and proportionate, with no apparent distortion or extra fingers. The fingers and hand shapes are consistent with natural human anatomy. The poses reflect a typical animated style associated with artistic representation, which is consistent with natural proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the characters' clothes and the grass field preserved naturally without losing detail or creating unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textures on the characters' clothes in Image B appear smooth and clear, with a representation typical in animated or illustrative styles, lacking photographic details but consistent with artistic expression. The grass field maintains a uniform color and shade without apparent unnatural patterns. Although less detailed than Image A due to the change in style, the depiction is coherent and expected in such artwork.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the lighting in the edited image accurately reflect the original sunlight direction, maintaining shadow and highlight placements in a natural manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting reflects a backlit scenario similar to Image A, with light coming from behind the characters, creating shadows towards the viewer. The highlights on the characters' edges and shadows cast on the ground are consistent with the direction of sunlight observed in the original, maintaining the overall sense of depth and realism expected in daylight.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the positioning and trajectory of the frisbee in mid-air consistent with realistic motion, avoiding any apparent physical inaccuracies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frisbee in Image B is positioned similarly to that in Image A, indicating it is captured mid-flight. Its trajectory and position are consistent with a throw or catch in progress and align with the poses of the individuals who seem prepared to catch it, suggesting realistic motion dynamics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the facial expressions and body postures of the characters align naturally with their dynamic poses and the context of playing frisbee, without any exaggerated or inconsistent distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B hold dynamic poses reflective of active movement consistent with playing frisbee. The body postures align with the action of reaching or anticipating a catch. While artistic interpretation renders them in a stylized form typical of animation or comics, the poses and expressions (excluding their faces) match with the activityâ€™s context.",
