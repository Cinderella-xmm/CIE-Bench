      "question": "Is the sun disc replacing the Sphinx’s head seamlessly integrated with the neck and body, showing no jagged edges or misaligned contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun disc is positioned as the head of the Sphinx, replacing its original human face. The visual cues of this integration show a smooth transition between the sun disc and the body, with no visible jagged edges or misalignments. Common sense indicates that any integration would look seamless and natural, without abrupt gaps or incorrect placements. Therefore, the integration of the sun disc appears well executed without any visual disruptions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the golden wings extend symmetrically from the sides of the Sphinx’s body with smooth, continuous surfaces and natural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the Sphinx with large golden wings extending from its body. The symmetry can be assessed by observing if both wings are evenly distributed and have identical shapes and angles. The wings are depicted with a smooth surface and a natural curve, indicating attention to detail in their addition. From world knowledge, symmetrical wings are designed for aesthetic balance, which seems to be effectively portrayed here.",

      "question": "Are the sand flows on the limbs continuous and gravity-consistent, without abrupt breaks or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sand flows depicted in Image B should logically adhere to gravity's pull, meaning continuous downward movement without breaks or floating sections. The edited image illustrates sand flowing seamlessly from the limbs toward the ground, following a consistent pattern that adheres to gravity's natural effects. The visualization correctly maintains continuity, ensuring the sand flows naturally and logically.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ankhs on the paws correctly shaped, properly scaled, and emitting a soft, localized glow without distorting adjacent textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ankhs on the Sphinx’s paws in Image B are analyzed for their shape, scale, and glow. Visually, they appear correctly shaped and proportioned relative to the paws. The glow emitted from the ankhs is localized, meaning it softly illuminates without disrupting adjacent textures or causing distortion. Based on world knowledge of lighting effects, the glow remains controlled and aesthetically pleasing.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire edited figure exhibit consistent lighting and shading across all added elements, with no visible seams or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited figure in Image B displays consistent lighting and shading methodology, which involves checking if added elements like the sun disc, wings, and glowing ankhs harmonize with the preexisting environment. The image shows a cohesive integration of lighting and shadows, with no discernible mismatches in texture or visible seams. This suggests a well-executed edit where all elements are unified under the same lighting treatment.",
