      "question": "Do the exaggerated muscles on the athleteâ€™s arms, shoulders, and abdomen follow natural anatomical contours without introducing unnatural bulges or broken shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms, shoulders, and abdomen of the athlete are depicted with an exaggerated muscular appearance typical of graphic illustrations or stylized artwork. The muscles are highly defined and follow the general anatomical structure observed in muscular human physiques. However, given the stylized nature, they are exaggerated for dramatic effect. The contours seem consistent with natural human anatomy in a stylized representation, not introducing any unnatural bulges or broken shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fiery red gloves with gold accents visually consistent in material texture and color, with no visible seams, pixelation, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gloves in Image B are depicted with a fiery red color and possibly gold accents. Their appearance seems consistent with the rest of the stylized illustration, which often smooths details for dramatic color and form. There is no visible pixelation or seams apparent, and the highlights seem naturally part of the intentional vibrant art style rather than errors in execution.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the strobe lights in the background evenly distributed and consistent in direction and intensity, without creating unnatural shadows or light leaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The strobe lights in the background of Image B appear to be evenly distributed and consistent with the overall dynamic feel of the stylized artwork. The light's directionality and intensity appear cohesive with the scene, enhancing the dramatic flair without introducing unnatural shadows or light anomalies that feel out of place.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blank motivational quote panel aligned with the perspective of the scene and does it have consistent lighting and shadowing to appear as if part of the environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motivational quote panel in the center seems well-aligned with the triptych composition format. The lighting and shadowing around the panel appear consistent with the surrounding artistic design, reinforcing the panel's integration as part of the overall scene rather than appearing as an external or misplaced element.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition balanced and framed appropriately so that the central figure and key elements (gloves, stance, lighting) remain clear and undistorted when scaled for print?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B is balanced across the triptych with a central motivational panel flanked by images of the athlete. The key elements like the gloves, the athlete's stance, and the energetic lighting are distinct and clear. Given the stylized art's emphasis on bold, clear forms, the composition is likely to remain sharp and balanced when scaled for print, maintaining clarity in key visual elements.",
