      "question": "Does the chibi-style representation of the bandage inside the packaging maintain structural coherence without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style bandage inside the packaging is designed to be cute, which is common in such artistic representations. This style simplifies features deliberately to enhance appeal. Visual cues show that the bandage character has coherent textures, like stitched patterns around the edges, which are akin to real bandages. The character maintains its shape well and does not present any textures or distortions that appear unnatural within this illustrative context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fabric texture and adhesive surface of the realistic bandage outside the packaging depicted with high detail and free from artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The realistic bandage in the edited image outside the packaging is displayed with a high level of detail, showcasing the distinct textures of the fabric and the adhesive surface. The lighting and shadows contribute to observing grainy textures consistent with real bandages. There are no artifacts visible that distort the visual information; the depiction is clean and precise.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the packaging design, including the isometric perspective and the label \"HEALING ESSENTIALS,\" integrate naturally into the scene without disrupting visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging design is consistent with the stylistic theme of a product box, with the label 'HEALING ESSENTIALS' presented clearly. The isometric perspective is logically applied, giving the box depth and dimension. The colors and typography are cohesive with the rest of the scene, maintaining visual credibility without any jarring elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and placement of the chibi-style bandage within the packaging logically consistent with the realistic bandage outside, avoiding any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style bandage is larger, fitting snugly inside the packaging based on its positioning and outline. While it doesn't replicate the realistic proportions of a real bandage, it maintains consistency in its own stylized form when compared to the realistic bandage outside. Both bandages are proportionally coherent within their contexts, avoiding distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the materials used for the packaging and the realistic bandage appear natural and consistent with their intended purpose, without any obvious unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging looks like it's made of standard cardboard for toys or collectibles, and the realistic bandage displays materials consistent with actual bandages. Both materials are depicted naturally, with textures and lighting that match their purpose, avoiding any distractions or artifacts that would seem unnatural.",
