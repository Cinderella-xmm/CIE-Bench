      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the sandpiper's body maintain correct proportions and natural posture, with wings aligned to the torso and legs positioned symmetrically beneath the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandpiper illustration on the packaging depicts a body that appears proportionate with a natural posture. The wings are visibly aligned with the torso, and the legs seem to be positioned symmetrically beneath the body. This suggests that the image maintains correct anatomy consistent with typical representations of birds like sandpipers in artistic illustrations, aligning with expected biological anatomy.",

      "question": "Are the textures on the packaging surface uniform in pattern and color, with no repeating tiles, sharp edges, or unnatural transitions between areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the packaging in Image B appears to have uniform textures with consistent color application and no visible sharp edges or unnatural transitions. The colors blend smoothly across the surface, indicative of professional and cohesive design consistent with commercial packaging standards.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Shoreline Explorer Set\" fully visible, correctly aligned, and rendered with smooth edges without jagged lines or transparency artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text \"Shoreline Explorer Set\" is prominently displayed on Image B. The alignment seems centered and appropriate for packaging design, and there are no visible jagged lines or transparent artifacts, suggesting that the text is well-rendered and clean, a common expectation for product packaging that needs to be legible and visually appealing.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the wave patterns on the flat bottom of the packaging form continuous, flowing curves without gaps, overlaps, or angular distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wave patterns at the bottom of Image B appear continuous, forming smooth curves that suggest natural water movement. There are no apparent gaps, overlaps, or angular distortions, indicating that the design was well-executed with attention to maintaining the flow and interpretive nature of water patterns typical in such imagery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the binocular-shaped cut-out window properly shaped with smooth contours, and does it show a clear, non-distorted view of internal kit components without floating or misplaced objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the binocular-shaped cut-out has smooth contours and allows a view into the internal kit components. The view through the window is clear and does not display any distortions, with no indication of floating or misplaced objects, reflecting quality control in the packaging design suitable for showcasing product features.",

      "question": "Is there a smooth, continuous transition between the sandpiper illustration and the surrounding packaging elements, with no visible outlines, shadows, or color discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandpiper illustration in Image B blends harmoniously with the surrounding packaging elements. There are no abrupt outlines, shadows, or color discontinuities evident, which implies that the illustrator effectively integrated the bird within the package design, maintaining a seamless transition typical in high-quality illustrations on commercial products.",
