    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes and smile drawn on the glass surface without causing visible distortion or blocking of the internal filament structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bulb is anthropomorphized with a face featuring eyes and a smile drawn onto the glass surface. Generally, when illustrations place features on a transparent surface, they are strategically positioned to avoid distorting internal elements. Here, the features are visible without majorly obscuring or distorting the internal filament structure, which is represented as part of the overall design rather than a functional element.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the arms extend from the bulb body in a way that follows the curvature of the glass and metal cage without appearing detached or geometrically broken?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bulb is depicted with cartoonish arms that seem to be attached to the sides of the body. These arms appear to extend naturally from the bulb, creatively following its cylindrical shape and integrating with the design without appearing geometrically broken or detached.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the metal cage fully intact with all loops connected and symmetrically arranged around the bulb, showing no missing or distorted sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bulb has been redesigned into a cartoon-like character, and the metal cage is transformed into part of the character’s design. The illustration keeps the metal cage loops symmetrically intact around the bulb, contributing to its character form without showcasing missing or distorted sections.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the background elements cast shadows and reflect light in a manner consistent with the direction and intensity of the bulb’s glow?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is stylized with elements that create an industrial environment. It features shadows and highlights that align with the light emitted by the bulb character, reflecting artistic consistency rather than realistic physics. The shading and light reflection reinforce the cartoon atmosphere, correctly aligning with the bulb's glow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the colors applied evenly across all surfaces (glass, metal, background) without visible banding, oversaturation, or texture degradation?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses a vintage-style palette, providing consistent color application across all surfaces. The glass, metal, and background feature evenly distributed colors, enhancing the classic illustration style without visible banding, oversaturation, or texture degradation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the text box and speech bubble positioned so that they do not overlap with the bulb’s internal structure or metal cage, and are they clearly readable?",
    "explanation": "In the comic-styled Image B, the text box and speech bubble are positioned nearby but do not obstruct the bulb's character design. They are placed outside the central figure's frame, keeping the internal bulb features visible and the text clearly readable.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the arms positioned in a way that follows natural joint angles and does not intersect with the bulb’s glass or metal cage in an impossible manner?",
    "explanation": "The cartoonish arms in Image B are drawn with bending and positioning that reflect typical anthropomorphic cartoon design, which allows for exaggerated angles, while still maintaining a sense of natural flow. They are integrated into the bulb character design without awkward intersections or unrealistic poses against the glass or metal structures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
