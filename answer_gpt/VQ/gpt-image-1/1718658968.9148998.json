      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the wooden puzzle pieces covering the castle's exterior uniformly textured with natural oak and mahogany variations, showing no repeating patterns or artificial seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle is constructed from wooden puzzle pieces, with the surface displaying textures similar to natural wood, with shades reminiscent of oak and mahogany. These variations appear natural, contributing to a realistic wood appearance, and no visible repeating patterns or seams disrupt this natural look. Therefore, based on the visual cues, the pieces appear uniformly textured.",

      "question": "Do the towers, archway, and surrounding walls retain their original shape and proportions without any geometric distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The towers, archway, and surrounding walls in Image B are built with precision, maintaining a clear and consistent shape. The proportions are symmetrical and well-aligned, with no visible distortion. The structural integrity seen suggests careful construction to match intended design shapes, reaffirmed by the uniformity of the interlocking puzzle pieces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the top edges of both towers composed of clearly interlocked wooden puzzle pieces with no gaps, floating fragments, or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the top edges of the towers in Image B, the wooden puzzle pieces fit seamlessly, with no visible gaps or signs of misaligned fragments. The pieces are intentionally interlocked in a stable manner, ensuring a continuous and connected edge, suggesting a well-designed and constructed puzzle.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the castle resting on a smooth, continuous wooden surface that matches the wood type and finish of the puzzle pieces, with consistent lighting and shadow under the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the castle on a wooden surface that visually aligns with the same texture and finish as the puzzle pieces. The continuity of the wood type and the way shadows and lighting uniformly interact with it confirm that the surface is consistent with the rest of the structure. Shadows appear natural and consistent across the base, supporting the observation of an evenly finished substrate.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the reflections in the water and shadows beneath the castle show accurate interaction with the wooden surface, with no unnatural glare, color shifts, or floating reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict water or reflections, as it presents a wooden puzzle model, indicating a deliberate edit from the original castle setting. Therefore, there are no reflections or water interactions present in the scene to analyze concerning this question.",
