      "question": "Does the crystal vase maintain the original shape and proportions of the ceramic vase, with clear faceted surfaces that follow the curvature without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal vase is visually similar in shape and proportions to that of the ceramic vase in Image A, maintaining a similar silhouette. The crystal vase exhibits clear faceted surfaces that conform to the overall curvature of the vase, resembling the ornate structure without any apparent geometric distortion. This observation aligns with common knowledge of how faceted crystal vases typically adhere to their shape, ensuring intricate details are preserved while altering the material.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the abstract floral patterns on the crystal vase etched into the surface with uniform depth and clarity, without appearing superimposed or blurred?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the abstract floral patterns etched onto the surface of the crystal vase appear with uniform depth and sharpness, typical of precision crystal cutting techniques. They do not give the appearance of being superimposed or blurred; instead, they look like they are part of the vaseâ€™s structure, which suggests high craftsmanship in crystal design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the crystal flowers retain the recognizable shapes of the original blooms and display internal refraction and pastel coloration without appearing solid or opaque?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal flowers in Image B maintain the recognizable shapes of the original blooms from Image A, reflecting the accuracy in the translation of form from ceramic to crystal. These flowers exhibit internal refraction, visible through their translucent nature and pastel-like coloration, differing from a solid or opaque appearance. This matches the typical characteristics of crystal objects which tend to manipulate light to create visual effects.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mirrored pedestal flat and reflective, showing a clear, undistorted reflection of the crystal vase and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirrored pedestal appears flat and highly reflective, showcasing a clear and undistorted reflection of the crystal vase and flowers. This is indicative of a well-maintained mirror surface that enhances the visual presentation of the crystal arrangement by providing an accurate reflection, consistent with common expectations for mirrors under proper lighting conditions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting show realistic refraction and internal glow in the crystal elements, with soft highlights and no unnatural bright spots or flat shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B effectively showcases realistic refraction and an internal glow within the crystal elements. The highlights are soft and natural, contributing to a sense of depth and brightness that is characteristic of transparent crystal. There are no unnatural bright spots or areas of flat shading observed, which suggests careful attention to detail in simulating how light interacts with crystal materials.",
