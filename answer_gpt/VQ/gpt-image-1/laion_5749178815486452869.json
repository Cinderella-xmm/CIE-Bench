      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the green field appear to float above the starry background with clean, continuous edges and no visible distortions or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green field is depicted as an island with its edges clearly defined against the starry background. The edges are smooth, continuous, and do not show any visible distortions or broken geometry, which contributes to the surreal floating effect typical of fantastical or imaginative art. This contrasts with Image A, where the field is part of a terrestrial landscape, not floating. The bright field color in Image B also provides a clean segregation from the cosmic background.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the yellow and red flowers vividly colored but free from unnatural texture artifacts or color fringing around their petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers are brightly colored, with yellow and red hues vividly displayed. The petals have smooth textures without unnatural artifacts or color fringing, retaining a natural and vibrant appearance even within the surreal art style. This depiction contrasts with Image A where the flowers may appear more integrated with the background natural scenery.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the apple-shaped object in the sky significantly larger than the tree and properly lit with consistent shading and texture, resembling a real fruit rather than a flat graphic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large apple is prominently shown, larger than any included tree or object, and it is consistently shaded to give a three-dimensional effect. The texture appears smooth and realistic with a shine that mimics natural lighting, contributing to a real fruit-like appearance. Image A lacks this large, centralized three-dimensional fruit object.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the insect figures (bee and butterfly) stylized but still identifiable, with smooth contours and no anatomical deformities or fragmented parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the insect figures are designed in an artistic, stylized form. The contours of both the bee and butterfly are smooth and clearly depict the respective anatomical shapes without deformities or fragmentation. This design maintains their identifiable features while fitting the surreal style. Compared to Image A, where the insects are part of an integrated natural scene, Image B uses artistic distortion without losing recognizability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the tree replaced by a hollow, angular geometric form with clean lines and internal voids, matching the surreal style without appearing fragmented or physically impossible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a hollow geometric form which serves as a substitute for a tree, matching the surreal thematic style. The geometric form is angular, with clean lines and internal voids that do not seem fragmented or physically impossible, despite its artistic abstraction. In Image A, a realistic tree is present, while Image B replaces that with a geometric form that adheres to the surreal aesthetic.",
