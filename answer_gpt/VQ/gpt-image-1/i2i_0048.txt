    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the proportions of the zebra's body consistent and free from any geometric distortions like warping or stretching?",
    "explanation": "Observing the zebra in Image B, its body proportions seem normal and consistent with natural zebra representations. The absence of unusual warping or stretching implies correct image processing or editing maintaining the authenticity of the subjectâ€™s anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the relative position between the zebra and the background grassland remain unchanged and natural?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a zebra in an urban setting, not a grassland backdrop. Therefore, the relative position cannot be compared to Image A's grassland background. The significant change of setting affects this aspect, making the scenario unnatural relative to a typical zebra habitat.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the grass blades and the zebra's hooves detailed and free from any loss of sharpness or introduction of noise?",
    "explanation": "Image B places the zebra in an urban environment, lacking grass blades to evaluate. The zebra's hooves, however, appear detailed and sharp, showing no introduction of noise. This suggests attention to maintaining quality in focused elements despite the background change.",
    "answer": "Yes"
