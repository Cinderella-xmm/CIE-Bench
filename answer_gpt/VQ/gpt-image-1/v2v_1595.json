      "question": "Does the soccer ball retain its natural hexagonal pattern and smooth texture after being transformed into a halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball maintains its hexagonal pattern, which is characteristic of soccer balls. The surface texture is represented using halftone dots typical of pop-art style. While its texture transforms into a pop-art style, the recognition and patterning are consistent with real soccer balls. Thus, the pattern is recognizable even though the texture is different due to the style change.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glittering effects on the goalpost converted into the halftone pop-art style without creating unnatural textures or losing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the goalpost is rendered in a halftone style, emphasizing the vibrant colors typical of pop art. The sparkle effects in Image A transform into bold lines and halftone shading. Although glittering effects are not directly replicated, the image maintains coherence and stylized detailing appropriate for pop art.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the soccer ball and the goalpost remain consistent and physically plausible after applying the halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays proportions similar to those in Image A, with the soccer ball and goalpost maintaining their expected size relative to one another. Their proportions align with real-world perspectives where a soccer ball is placed in front of a goalpost.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the soccer ball and the netting of the goalpost preserved without distortion in the halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the soccer ball maintains its hexagonal and pentagonal geometries characteristic of soccer balls, and the netting is replicated with consistent mesh patterns. The halftone pop-art style does not distort these basic geometric elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the soccer ball and goalpost maintain visual credibility without introducing obvious artifacts in the halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition visually represents a recognizable perspective where the soccer ball is clearly in front of the goalpost, a plausible setup in a sports context. The pop-art transformation alters colors but keeps the layout coherent and attractive without unnecessary artifacts.",
