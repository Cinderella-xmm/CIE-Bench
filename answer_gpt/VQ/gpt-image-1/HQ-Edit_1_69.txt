    "Question": "Q1: Does the red dress maintain natural fabric folds and surface texture despite increased saturation and bold outlines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the red dress is represented in a style similar to graphic illustration or animation, which uses bold outlines and flat colors. This artistic style inherently simplifies textures and folds, opting for a cleaner graphic representation. Therefore, the dress does not maintain naturalistic fabric folds and surface texture as seen in realistic photography.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the woman’s leg and arm positions consistent with natural human biomechanics during a walking motion?",
    "explanation": "Image B simplifies the woman's posture and movement in an illustration style. The arm and leg positions, shown in stylized motion, are consistent with typical walking dynamics. They do not appear awkward or unnatural despite the artistic rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the black slipcase visually integrated into the scene with consistent lighting and shadow direction relative to the surrounding environment?",
    "explanation": "The black slipcase in Image B is designed in stark contrast to the surrounding colorful panels and lacks integration with the illustrated scene's lighting and shadows. It appears as a separate design element rather than being seamlessly integrated into the environment.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the bold outlines around the woman’s body follow the natural contours of her shape without creating gaps or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses bold outlines typical of artistic illustrations to define shapes. These outlines closely follow the contours of the woman's form, maintaining a consistent edge without gaps or incorrect overlapping, indicative of proficient graphic stylization.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the woman’s right hand have five fingers with natural proportions and smooth skin texture, without deformation or extra digits?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's right hand is drawn in an illustrative style emphasizing proportion and clarity. While true texture is absent due to the graphic format, the hand maintains a correct number of fingers with visually natural proportions, conforming to common depictions in this art style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
