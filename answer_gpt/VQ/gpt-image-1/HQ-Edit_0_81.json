      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the elderly man’s robe evenly distributed, continuous across folds and seams, and free from jagged edges or texture repetition artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man's robe features vivid geometric patterns typical of stylized or abstract interpretations commonly found in illustrations. The color palette is more vibrant, and the designs appear to cover the entire garment uniformly. These types of illustrations tend to avoid small visual artifacts such as jagged edges as they are designed to maintain visual clarity and appeal. Hence, the design is likely to be continuous and evenly distributed across the garment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the ornate wooden staff maintain a natural wood appearance with coherent grain direction, proper thickness, and no floating or detached decorative elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the illustrated image, the wooden staff appears to be more symbolic, fitting a colorful and exaggerated style. The natural wood appearance may be stylized with exaggerated grain and colors. The design avoids realistic grain direction to match the overall aesthetic, focusing instead on harmonizing with the vibrant surroundings. Given these characteristics, the staff likely maintains a coherent artistic style but may not reflect a realistic wood grain appearance.",

      "question": "Are the colors of the spice piles in the background visibly intensified but still physically plausible, without color bleed, haloing, or loss of individual grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the spices are illustrated with heightened colors, matching the vivid and decorative overall theme. While realistic depictions ensure individual grain texture to maintain physical plausibility, illustrative styles focus on color impact. This might lead to a reduced emphasis on texture detail and a simplified play of light and shadow to enhance color presence. Color bleeding or haloing could occur due to the illustrative approach, moving away from photorealistic textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the decorative border motif clearly defined, properly aligned with the image’s edge, and positioned without intersecting or distorting any existing elements such as people, stalls, or ground tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The border motif clearly demarcates the scene into a traditional illustrative frame, which is consistent with stylized designs found in artworks containing borders. These motifs are typically well-aligned and customized to enhance the illustration's focal elements without clashing with key elements such as people or stalls. Proper framing maintains compositional integrity, suggesting that the border does not intrude on existing elements within the image.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the wooden box held by the man show consistent wood grain, proper shadowing under ambient light, and natural flower arrangement without distorted petals or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden box partakes in the highly stylized and colorful aesthetic. Therefore, detailed wood grain might not be depicted in a traditional sense. The flower arrangement is exaggerated with vibrant, almost unnatural colors, staying true to the artistic style rather than realism. Thus, there might be a lack of naturally occurring shadows and petal detail commonly found in realistic depictions.",
