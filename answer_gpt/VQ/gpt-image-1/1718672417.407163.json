      "question": "Are the braids on the alpaca’s neck and head seamlessly integrated with metallic ornaments and amulets without visible texture mismatches or broken strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the alpaca’s braids are adorned with detailed metallic ornaments and amulets. The integration is examined by observing the continuity between the strands and the ornaments, ensuring the strands do not have any disconnection or mismatched textures. The ornaments appear to be well-integrated without visible breaks in the strands, suggesting good cohesion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the newly added Norse-style garments around the alpaca’s body show coherent patterns and visible runic inscriptions without jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the garments’ patterns and inscriptions should be scrutinized for sharpness and coherent design. The runic motifs and textures seem smoothly rendered with clear lines, indicating high attention to texture and placement without jagged edges. This suggests that the garments have been integrated with care.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the standing stones in the background positioned naturally within the forest scene, with proper scale, shadowing, and mist effects that match the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluating Image B's background, the stones must be assessed in terms of perspective, scale, and environmental coherence. The stones are positioned naturally with shadowing that corresponds to the misty backdrop, creating a realistic scene that maintains the atmosphere's consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the metallic components and amulets in the braids anchored realistically, with no floating elements or unnatural angles that suggest poor integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic elements in Image B are observed for their interaction with the braids to assess realism. The beads and pendants are placed at logical angles and positions which suggest natural integration without floating or appearing detached from the strands.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the alpaca’s facial features, including eyes, nose, and mouth, proportionally correct and aligned with the rest of the head despite added accessories and styling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even though the face is not visible, in assessing Image B, alpaca facial features in terms of alignment and proportionality could be inferred from the general symmetry and positioning of accessories and braids around the head, suggesting a consistent integration with the head's shape.",
