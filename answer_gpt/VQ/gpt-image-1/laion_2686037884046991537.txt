    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes and mouth drawn on the whoopie pie surfaces aligned with the curvature of the cookie and free from visible distortions or floating elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the whoopie pie characters' facial features, such as the eyes and mouth, are cartoonishly superimposed. These elements are aligned with the surface of the whoopie pie, with no visible distortions like floating elements or misalignment that could disrupt the perception of a curved surface. This design choice supports the visual illusion of actual characters without visual disturbances.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the chocolate cookie surface retain its original texture pattern (such as cracks and dimples) beneath the cartoon-style coloring, or is it completely smoothed out in an unnatural way?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon rendering of the whoopie pie characters has smoothed out the chocolate cookie's surface texture. The distinctive natural patterns like cracks and dimples that would typically be visible on such a surface are replaced with a flat, solid color indicative of a cartoon style, which makes the surface appear unnatural compared to a realistic presentation.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the limbs of the whoopie pie characters proportionally scaled to the cookie body and connected at logical points (e.g., sides or top), without appearing detached or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "The limbs of the whoopie pie characters in Image B are proportionally designed and appropriately attached to the sides of each character. They do not appear to be detached or misaligned. The design follows a logical attachment at the sides of the cookies, consistent with anthropomorphic cartoon standards.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the spatula held by the leading whoopie pie character proportionally sized compared to the cookie body and oriented in a way that suggests natural grip and movement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spatula is of a size that complements the overall scale of the whoopie pie character. It does not overpower the figure nor is it disproportionately small. The spatula is held in a position and manner that humorously suggests the character's intention to embark on an adventure, thus reflecting a natural grasp by the cartoon character’s hand.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the two whoopie pie characters peering over the edge of the plate positioned so that their lower halves remain below the plate’s edge, with no unnatural floating or cut-off limbs?",
    "explanation": "The whoopie pie characters in Image B are drawn such that their lower halves appropriately appear to be behind and below the plate's edge. There is no indication of floating or cut-off limbs; they are integrated logically within the setting, respecting spatial logic and gravity, as depicted in a cartoon setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "explanation": "In Image B, the text bubble is positioned near the speaking character without overlapping essential features such as eyes or limbs, providing clear communication and preserving the integrity of the image's visual structure. The font used is clear and easy to read without any blurriness, upholding both aesthetic appeal and legibility.",
