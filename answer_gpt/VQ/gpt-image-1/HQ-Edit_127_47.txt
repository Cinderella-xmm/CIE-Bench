    "Question": "Q1: Are the trees, mountains, and water inside the glass orb correctly proportioned and undistorted despite the spherical enclosure, with no visible warping or bending of vertical lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass orb contains a miniature landscape scene that includes trees, mountains, and water. Despite the spherical shape of the orb, the vertical lines of the trees and the horizon appear straight and not distorted. The image maintains the natural proportions and alignment of these elements, indicating a careful adaptation to the orb's curvature. This observation is based on the visual examination of the enclosed scene, where the natural vertical alignment and proportions remain unaffected by the orb's shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the ducks retain their natural body shape and size relative to the water and rocks, with smooth, reflective surfaces that do not show exaggerated shine or unnatural specular highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ducks inside the glass orb are depicted as smooth and glossy figurines. Their size and shape appear realistic and consistent with the scale of the surrounding water and rocks. While they have reflective surfaces typical of polished objects, the highlights are not exaggerated or unnatural, contributing to a coherent and believable miniature scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the water beneath the ducks transparent enough to clearly see the rocky bottom, with no visible layering artifacts, texture tiling, or unnatural opacity variations?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the water inside the orb is depicted as clear, allowing a view of the rocky base beneath it. There are no visible artifacts, such as layering or texture repetition that would distract from the scene's realism. The transparency of the water is consistent, without unnatural opacity changes, enhancing the visual integrity of the miniature diorama.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the miniature animal figurines positioned on solid surfaces (rocks or ground), properly scaled compared to surrounding elements, and free from floating or unnatural shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the animal figurines are precisely placed on the rocks, fitting naturally into the scene. Their scale is appropriate in comparison to the ducks and rocks, adding to the scene's realism. Additionally, there are no apparent floating elements or unnatural shadowing effects, which confirms their grounded and cohesive placement within the miniature landscape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the wood base have a natural grain pattern and cast a consistent shadow under the orb, indicating physical contact and realistic lighting interaction?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the glass orb resting on a wood base that features a realistic grain pattern. The shadow cast beneath the orb is consistent with the direction and intensity of the light source, suggesting genuine contact and interaction between the base and the orb. This detail helps in creating a believable and well-integrated presentation for the overall scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
