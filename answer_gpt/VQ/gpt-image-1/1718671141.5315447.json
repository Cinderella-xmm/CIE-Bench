      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brass gears and copper funnels added to the building's exterior consistent in material appearance, showing realistic metallic reflections and surface details without artificial or pixelated textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the exterior of the building prominently features brass gears and copper funnels that are typical of steampunk design elements. These additions show realistic metallic reflections characteristic of actual brass and copper, with proper surface details indicating metallic quality. There are no signs of artificial or pixelated textures, suggesting that the rendering of the material is high-quality and consistent with real metal. This conclusion is drawn from the visible metallic shine and texture alignment observed in the structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the clock faces on the observatory dome maintain correct proportions and alignment with the spherical shape, with no visible warping or bending of clock numerals or hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock faces feature proportional roman numerals and hands that align seamlessly with the spherical shape of the dome. The numerals and hands are straight rather than warped, maintaining the circular structure typically seen in clock designs. This visual consistency indicates that the clock faces are correctly aligned with the dome, ensuring a realistic representation without distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the steam emanating from the structure appear volumetric and translucent, rising naturally from vents without abrupt edges or unnatural clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steam arises from various vents around the structure, displaying a volumetric quality and translucence typical of real steam. It rises naturally without abrupt edges, indicating proper rendering of gaseous movements. The steam clusters naturally in wisps and flows, further supporting the realistic appearance typical in atmospheric conditions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ornamental metal details on the observatory dome continuous and properly scaled, with no gaps, overlapping errors, or jagged edges suggesting incomplete rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental metal details on the dome are consistently rendered, showcasing proper scaling and continuity. There are no visual signs of gaps, overlapping errors, or jagged edges that would suggest incomplete or faulty rendering. The details contribute to the overall elaborate steampunk design while maintaining coherence with the dome's architectural structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the reflection of the building in the water a symmetrical and undistorted mirror image of the edited structure, including all added steampunk elements such as gears, clock faces, and steam vents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection in the water mirrors the features of the building above, including the added steampunk elements. Detailed elements like gears, clock faces, and steam vents appear in the reflection with symmetry and without distortion, maintaining the visual integrity of the structure in the reflection. The consistency and alignment validate that the reflection is a correct mirror image, showing the added elements clearly and accurately.",
