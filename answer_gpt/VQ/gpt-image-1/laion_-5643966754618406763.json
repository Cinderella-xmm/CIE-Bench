    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the tread patterns on the tire surfaces preserved and reinterpreted as armored segments with no visible texture repetition or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armored segments on the creature resemble tread patterns with consistent detail across its surface, much like tires. The texture is uniformly distributed without visible repetition or detail loss. This reinterpretation maintains the tactile depth seen in tire surfaces, ensuring a creative yet faithful transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic joints within the wheel openings align properly with the original rim shape and appear physically connected without gaps or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a robotic armadillo with mechanical limbs reminiscent of tire rims and joints. The physical connections here are seamless, without noticeable gaps or misalignment. The design of the creature integrates these components naturally, maintaining structural integrity without deformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glowing mechanical eyes centered within the hub openings, emitting light consistently without haloing, pixelation, or unnatural brightness spillage onto adjacent surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing eyes in Image B are centrally located within the head segment, designed akin to a hub opening. The light emission is smooth and consistent, showing no signs of haloing or pixelation. The brightness is managed well, enhancing the visual appeal without spilling unnaturally over adjacent surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the antennae attached to the upper portion of the tire stack with continuous, smooth geometry and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the antennae are protruding from the robotic armadillo's head, showing smooth and continuous form. Visually, there are no floating or disconnected segments, ensuring cohesive attachment at the point of origin.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire structure composed of the tires forming a unified, balanced creature shape with no missing, duplicated, or incorrectly scaled parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B is constructed using parts that resemble tire components, forming a unified and balanced robotic armadillo. Each segment is uniquely scaled, contributing cohesively to the whole without errors such as missing or duplicated parts. The design showcases creativity while maintaining structural integrity.",
