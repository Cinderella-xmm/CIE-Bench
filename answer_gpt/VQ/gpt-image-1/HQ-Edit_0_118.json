      "question": "Are the edges and transitions of the woman’s clothing, hair, and facial features smooth and consistent with watercolor rendering, without jagged lines or unnatural texture breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork adopts a watercolor style, characterized by smooth transitions and soft blends. The woman's clothing and hair edges appear fluid, aligning with watercolor's natural consistency, void of any jagged lines or unnatural breaks. This style is typically smooth, as watercolor blends colors in a gradual manner, allowing seamless transitions in texture and outline.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the elongated drape sections of the robe follow natural gravitational flow and maintain consistent fabric thickness and fold patterns without appearing stretched or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the robe's drape sections in a manner consistent with natural gravitational flow, typical of watercolor art. The fabric maintains consistent thickness and fold patterns, presenting a realistic depiction of cloth’s weight and texture. Watercolor styles typically emphasize smooth, flowing lines that suggest fabric folds naturally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the botanical patterns on the robe evenly distributed, aligned with the fabric weave, and blended naturally with the surrounding colors without visible seams or repetition artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the botanical patterns on the robe are shown with an even distribution, characteristic of a well-rendered watercolor. The alignment with fabric weave presents a natural incorporation, blending adeptly with surrounding hues. Watercolors excel in seamless pattern integration, avoiding visible seams or artifacts typical of digital editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the leaf outlines within the book pages clearly defined, proportionally scaled to the page size, and integrated without distorting the book's spine, edges, or page curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaf outlines in the book pages in Image B are well-defined, proportionally scaled to complement the page size. They integrate fluidly, without distorting the book’s structural elements like the spine or curvature, fitting harmoniously into the overall watercolor style, which traditionally supports clean, scaled details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the added sun rays originate from a logical direction relative to the tree canopy and cast soft glows and subtle shadows that match the depth and density of the surrounding foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has sun rays that originate logically from the light source suggested by the tree canopy above, creating soft glows and shadows resonant with the depth of surrounding foliage. Watercolors commonly portray light effects and shadows in a nuanced manner, enhancing realism and dimensionality.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the border positioned uniformly around the image edge, containing subtle literary symbols (e.g., books, quills), and does it not obscure or distort any part of the main subject or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The border in Image B is placed uniformly along the image edges, adorned with small literary symbols like books, which are characteristic of artistic framing. It does not obscure or distort the primary elements of the subject or background, maintaining the composition's integrity. This consistency is key in aesthetically balancing artwork.",
