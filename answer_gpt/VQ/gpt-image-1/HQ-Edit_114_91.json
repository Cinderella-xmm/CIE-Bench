    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the ivy formations on the hammerhead shaped like symmetrical, watchful eyes with natural leaf arrangement and no visible digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus should be on whether there are any formations on the owl-like structure present in place of the anvil, specifically checking for ivy formations. It seems that the ivies are carefully integrated to form the owl's face, adding to its mystical and symmetrical look, especially emphasizing the eyes. The design appears natural without noticeable digital artifacts in these regions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss-covered bark texture cover the hammer and anvil uniformly without abrupt color shifts, patchy areas, or synthetic-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anvil and the hammer have been transformed into an owl shape covered in moss and bark-like texture. The texture appears organically integrated and consistent throughout, matching the coloration and pattern one would expect from moss on wood, without abrupt changes or visible synthetic-looking patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the root-like structures beneath the anvil extend downward from the base in a way that mimics real tree roots, with tapering thickness and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a typical anvil, the lower portion extends into root-like formations emanating from the transformed owl body. These roots look natural as they taper towards the end, and they logically connect with the 'base,' resting on the table without any indication of floating or disconnection.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the emerald runes integrated into the bark surface such that they appear carved in, with subtle glow that blends into the surrounding texture and does not cause bright outlines or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The runes on the owl structure in Image B are illustrated with a distinct glow typical of emerald luminescence. These symbols seem embedded or carved into the bark material, and the glow is subtle enough to blend with the surrounding texture, not resulting in bright outlines or evident pixelation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the ivy tendrils follow logical climbing paths from the window frame and floor, wrapping around the hammer and anvil without crossing through solid parts or appearing suspended in mid-air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ivy tendrils originate and extend logically from the window frame and the floor area, enveloping the transformed owl design suitably. The ivy naturally follows solid structures, without visually conflicting with the surrounding objects or unnaturally appearing suspended.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the transformed anvil and hammer fall consistently with the light source from the window, and do they interact naturally with the wooden table and surrounding tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The light from the window in Image B casts shadows in the scene, aligning with the transformed owl structure's positioning on the table. The shadows interact naturally with the environment, considering the set light source direction and the surrounding objects like the tools, avoiding inconsistency or unnatural lighting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
