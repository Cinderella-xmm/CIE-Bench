      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the shrunk vegetables retain their natural texture and fine details without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts reduced broccoli and cauliflower. The broccoli maintains its bumpy texture, and the cauliflower retains its curd-like surface, indicating that the small-scale representation preserves detail consistent with their natural textures. There are no visible artifacts or unnatural smoothening, which would suggest an altered texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the shapes of the shrunk vegetables proportionate and physically plausible, avoiding any unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both broccoli and cauliflower florets appear proportionate. The broccoli exhibits the typical tree-like structure with an expanded head and the cauliflower maintains its rounded form. There is no evidence of unnatural distortions such as excessive elongation or compression.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shrinkage preserve the natural colors and material appearance of the vegetables without introducing any artificial tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the reduced vegetables in Image B shows that the broccoli retains a vibrant green hue, and the cauliflower remains white, consistent with their natural colors. There is no introduction of non-natural hues, such as unexpected saturation or color shifts that could denote artificial modification.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the spatial arrangement of the shrunk vegetables consistent with the original structure, maintaining visual credibility within the dish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the arrangement in Image A with the shrinkage in Image B, the broccoli and cauliflower remain ordered similarly within their casserole. Despite the smaller size, they preserve a cohesive, visually credible arrangement suggestive of intentional placement rather than random scattering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the edges and geometric shapes of the shrunk vegetables remained intact, avoiding any broken or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables maintain intact, unbroken edges. Both the trees of the broccoli and the curves of the cauliflower demonstrate smooth outlines without any unusual breaks or jaggedness, which would suggest damage or distortion at this smaller scale.",
