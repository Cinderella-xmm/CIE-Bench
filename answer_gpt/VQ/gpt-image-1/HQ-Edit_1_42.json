      "question": "Does the cartoon version of the man have correctly proportioned limbs, five fingers per hand, and natural joint angles without bending or elongation errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the cartoon version of the man is depicted with simplified and stylized features typical of cartoon art. While it's common for cartoon characters to have exaggerated or simplified features, in this case, the man seems to have correctly proportioned limbs, with no visible bending or elongation errors in the arms and legs. However, the hands are drawn in a simplified manner, and it's common for cartoon characters to have fewer than five fingers for ease of drawing.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the swirling leaves positioned in a way that follows logical airflow paths and do not intersect or pass through the man’s body or bench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the leaves are depicted swirling around the man in a way that suggests they are being carried by the wind, a common artistic representation in autumn-themed art. The placement of the leaves does not intersect or pass unnaturally through the man’s body or the bench, as they seem to float around him, aligning with typical airflow paths in such scenarios.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tree canopies and foliage display consistent color distribution and intact branching structures without visible breaks or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree canopies and foliage in the edited image are stylized with a consistent autumn color palette of oranges and browns. These colors are distributed evenly across the art, and the branches appear intact without visible breaks. The edges of branches and leaves align with the overall style of the artwork, which is illustrative and smooth.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cream-colored paper background uniformly textured and do the tree branch motifs lie flat without distortion, clipping, or unnatural shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the edited image features a cream-colored paper texture, typical of stylized illustrations to give a vintage feel. The tree branch motifs are laid flat against this background, and there is no noticeable distortion, clipping, or unnatural shadowing that distracts from the overall composition, indicating a cohesive design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the elements (man, leaves, bench, paper border) arranged within clear margins and aligned symmetrically or logically to suggest a bounded page layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the elements are placed logically within each frame, creating a balanced and intentional composition. The man, leaves, and bench are centered within each scene of the grid. The paper border acts as a frame, suggesting a clear bounded page layout for each vignette of the cartoon sequences, which is aligned symmetrically and logically.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all surfaces (clothing, skin, leaves, paper) rendered with consistent sharpness and texture detail without jagged lines, smudging, or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the surfaces are rendered with consistent sharpness and texture detail, maintaining the stylized cartoon aesthetic. There are no jagged lines or smudges present. The leaves, paper, and clothing are smooth and consistent with the art style's illustrative nature, avoiding any unnatural smoothing that would deter from the designed appearance.",
