    "Question": "Q1: Is the head proportionally enlarged but still geometrically consistent with the neck and shoulders, without unnatural stretching or compression?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the head is stylized, reflecting a chibi or cartoon style which commonly features enlarged heads while ensuring proportional consistency with the body parts they connect, like the neck and shoulders. World knowledge about chibi style suggests that this is typical, and visually, the head does align well with the neck and shoulders.",

    "Question": "Q4: Does the bent posture maintain anatomical alignment of the spine, hips, and knees without unnatural angles or floating segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite being stylized, the posture maintains an appropriate anatomical alignment. The simplified cartoon form keeps the proportions and bend of spine, hips, and knees consistent without introducing unnatural angles or segment separations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
