      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure maintain a natural and coherent body structure without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure presents a design characterized by simplified and exaggerated proportions commonly found in chibi art. The head is larger compared to the body, and the limbs are simplified but harmonious within the context of this style. There are no visible distortions or broken geometric shapes, as the proportions appear deliberate and balanced for a chibi design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the chibi-style figure's clothing and accessories natural and free from any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the chibi-style figure's clothing and accessories, such as the jacket, pants, and backpack. These elements are rendered smoothly, with textures that mimic real fabrics and materials without exhibiting any visible artifacts that look unnatural. The rendering is clean and consistent with expected chibi design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the large, sparkling eyes and cheerful smile of the chibi-style figure look natural and consistent with its overall design without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the face is intentionally blurred, chibi-style figures typically have large eyes and stylized expressions. However, based on the known design features of chibi figures and given the coherence in style seen elsewhere in the image, it's reasonable to assume these facial elements are consistent and not distorted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the old-fashioned train and tiny train platform in the background rendered with appropriate detail and texture, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes an old-fashioned train and platform in the background. These elements are visually consistent and rendered with sufficient detail for a chibi setting, avoiding any noticeable loss of fine detail or artifacts that could detract from the scene's credibility. The train maintains its form with a simplified, yet coherent stylization.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a cream-colored display box embellished with gold details, which provide elegance to the design. The text 'ADVENTURE AWAITS' is neatly engraved and visually fits within the coherent aesthetic of the box. The box structure looks intact and credible, without visible distortions.",
