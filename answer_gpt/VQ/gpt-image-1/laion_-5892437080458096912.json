      "question": "Does the gold necklace at the neck area have smooth, continuous lines without jagged edges or pixelation, and does it integrate seamlessly with the surrounding skin and garment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold necklace appears smooth and continuous, as it's rendered in a classic style fitting for an ancient Greek or Roman theme. Given that the design uses clean lines and consistent colors, the integration into the overall image theme would naturally lead us to believe it integrates well with the surrounding skin and garment. There appears to be no notable pixelation or misalignment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the golden satin material on the gown uniformly textured with consistent light reflection, and do the geometric embroidery patterns follow logical symmetry and spacing without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gown's appearance suggests a rich, satin-like material typical of ancient artworks, with light reflecting consistently, suggesting a smooth and continuous texture. The geometric embroidery, reminiscent of ancient Greek motifs, is symmetrically placed, following logical spacing and without distortion, in keeping with traditional ergonomic alignments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the exposed shoulders anatomically accurate with natural skin tone and texture, and are the Greek motifs clearly defined and properly aligned with the shoulder structure without overlapping or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The exposed shoulders are well-aligned in terms of anatomical accuracy, with a natural skin tone that matches the rest of the visible skin areas. The Greek motifs are clearly defined, consistently aligned with the shoulder structure, and are appropriately distanced to avoid any overlap or warping, maintaining classic symmetry and structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background scene feature coherent lighting, realistic proportions of olive trees and columns, and a seamless integration with the figureâ€™s silhouette without visible edges or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background is designed with coherent lighting, which aligns with the figure's lighting, enhancing the realism of the overall image. The proportions of the olive trees and columns are rendered typically to fit a Roman or Greek theme, showing consistent scale and perspective. The integration with the figure appears smooth, with no visible edges or misalignment suggesting any post-edit interruptions in the continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand near the waist have five distinct fingers with natural joint angles, smooth skin texture, and proper shadowing consistent with the light source, without any added or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand displayed has clearly visible five fingers which are naturally positioned, with appropriate joint angles that correspond to a relaxed pose near the waist. The skin looks smooth and well-blended with the gown, and shadows are consistent with the articulated light source, indicative of proper artistic rendering.",
