        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The phoenix claws in Image B are proportionate and have natural joint angles, characteristic of realistic bird claws. The flame held by the claws emits a soft, diffused glow, lacking harsh outlines or an unnatural level of brightness, which suggests a realistic depiction of light behavior.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the magical elements such as plumage, embers, claws, and flame appear to cast shadows and reflect light in a manner that is consistent with the ambient lighting on the wooden surface. This consistency in lighting and shadow is crucial for avoiding any appearance of these elements floating or being disconnected from the scene.",
