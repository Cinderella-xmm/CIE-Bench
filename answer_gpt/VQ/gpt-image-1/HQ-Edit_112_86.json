    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the main body of the teapot appear as clear glass with visible internal reflections and refractions consistent with transparent material, without any opaque or metallic residue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main body of the teapot is transparent, consistent with clear glass, displaying internal reflections and refractions characteristic of such materials. This transparency is evident as the floral patterns are engraved or frosted on the surface and do not impede visibility. Commonly, glassware allows light to pass through relatively unobstructed, confirming the absence of opaque or metallic residue.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the glass surface uniformly frosted with no signs of smudging, uneven opacity, or artificial texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns on the teapot's glass surface in Image B are consistently frosted, showcasing an even distribution of opacity throughout the design. Frosting a pattern usually involves techniques that require precision to avoid smudging or uneven textures, which is well-executed here without any visible artifacts or inconsistencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the handle and spout exhibit a consistent amber tint with smooth gradients and sharp boundaries, without color fringing or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the handle and spout demonstrate a uniform amber tint. The gradients are smooth, and the transitions from tinted to untinted areas are sharp, ensuring the boundaries are clearly defined. The absence of color fringing or unnatural highlights suggests a well-rendered, realistic depiction of tinted glass.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the reflection under the teapot symmetrical, sharp, and correctly aligned with the objectâ€™s base, showing accurate contours and transparency effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection seen under the teapot in Image B is symmetrical, aligning accurately with the teapot's base. The contours are sharp and reflect the transparent nature of the teapot, indicating that the reflection was handled with precision to maintain realism in transparency effects, consistent with glass objects on reflective surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the lid, spout, handle, and body preserved such that there are no stretched, compressed, or misaligned sections compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, both images display identical proportions for the lid, spout, handle, and body, suggesting that no elements appear stretched, compressed, or misaligned. In any glass or metal crafting, maintaining proportions is crucial for function and aesthetics, and this consistency is evident here between glass and metal teapot depictions.",
