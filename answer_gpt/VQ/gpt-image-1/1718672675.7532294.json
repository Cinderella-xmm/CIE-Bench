    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the armor-like rock sections maintain visible sedimentary layering and natural erosion contours consistent with the surrounding cliff face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rock armor of the giant figure is designed to integrate with the natural cliff setting. The armor appears to mimic natural rock formations with visible stratification and texture that echo the natural cliff seen in Image A. This suggests that the editor intended for the armor to appear as part of the landscape, blending with the naturally occurring sedimentary layers and erosion features. Such design choices make the rock sections appear consistent with the surrounding environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the moss growth confined to shaded or moist areas of the rock armor and does it show natural variation in density and color rather than uniform application?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, moss is depicted on specific sections of the rock armor, often in shaded areas or crevices where moisture would naturally collect, much like real moss growth in natural environments. The density and color of the moss also vary, suggesting an attention to detail in replicating natural growth patterns, rather than applying a uniform layer of vegetation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the spectral limbs originate from the cliff base and merge with the sea surface in a way that preserves water-level continuity and avoids floating or detached appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spectral limbs in Image B appear to flow from the base of the giant figure and seamlessly merge into the sea, suggesting a mystical yet continuous connection. The limbs appear integrated with the sea level, preserving the illusion that they are part of the natural environment and not detached objects.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees forming the mane spaced irregularly and angled naturally along the cliff edge, consistent with wind exposure and terrain slope?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees on the giant's head are depicted with irregular spacing and varying angles, which would be consistent with how trees typically grow in response to wind exposure and the slope of terrain on a cliff top. This irregularity reflects a more realistic interaction with environmental factors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the runes follow natural rock fissures and exhibit soft edges with shadowing that matches ambient lighting, rather than appearing as crisp, untextured overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The runes on Image B's rock armor have edges that blend naturally with the rock's texture and exhibit shadowing compatible with the ambient lighting, giving them a more integrated and realistic appearance. They avoid looking like crisp, superficial additions and instead seem to belong to the rock face.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the spiraling spirits emit or absorb light in a way that matches the sun's position and create subtle volume effects consistent with mist or vapor, without sharp edges or unnatural opacity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swirling spirits exhibit a light interaction that corresponds with the sunset lighting, casting appropriate shades and not overshadowing the sunâ€™s influence. These spirits possess a mist-like, translucent quality without harsh edges, which aligns with how vapor interacts with light, contributing to a realistic and mystical ambiance.",
