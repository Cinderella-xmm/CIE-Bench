        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the woman and child appear larger and follow the Japanese Chibi style, which typically features exaggerated eye size. However, the positioning and spacing of the eyes remain proportional to their facial structures, with no distortion or unnatural spacing. This style is intentional and characteristic of the Chibi aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the added floral accents in the background consistent in size, lighting, and texture with the existing flowers and do they cast plausible shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is styled as a Chibi art piece where the background emphasizes the whimsical depiction of flowers. The floral accents, although simple, maintain consistent size and lighting relative to the rest of the artwork. Due to the nature of this art style, shadows are more implied than realistic, designed to enhance the overall picture's charm.",
