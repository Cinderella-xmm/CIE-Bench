    "Question": "Q1: Do the brass and copper elements on the uniform show natural surface variations, such as subtle scratches, patina, and reflective highlights, without appearing uniformly smooth or unnaturally glossy?",
    "explanation": "The brass and copper elements on the uniform show realistic texture with natural surface variations, such as wear, scratches, and highlights typical of metallic surfaces. This is achieved through careful attention to lighting and material properties that avoid an overly polished appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the gear components on the uniform properly embedded within the fabric structure, maintaining consistent depth and avoiding overlapping or misaligned teeth that break geometric continuity?",
    "explanation": "The gear components are integrated neatly into the fabric structure of the uniform. They maintain consistent depth and alignment, ensuring their teeth fit together without breaking geometric continuity, giving a coherent and plausible appearance of functionality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the mechanical throne have visible support structures and grounding that prevent it from appearing suspended or unstable, with all cogwheels and braces attached logically to the frame?",
    "explanation": "The mechanical throne features visible support structures that logically connect cogwheels and braces to the frame. This logical attachment of components provides a sense of stability and grounding to the throne, making it appear secure and not suspended.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the copper, brown, and dark green hues distributed evenly across the uniform, throne, and background, with transitions between colors following natural lighting gradients and avoiding abrupt or patchy changes?",
    "explanation": "The colors are distributed evenly, with smooth transitions that follow natural gradients of lighting. There are no abrupt changes or patchy zones, suggesting a cohesive and realistic depiction of shades across elements in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the steam trails in the background have gradual opacity and wispy edges, flowing naturally from potential sources like vents or machinery, without sharp outlines or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "The trails of steam in the background exhibit gradual opacity and wispy edges, which flow naturally as one would expect from machinery or vents. These traits give a realistic and flowing dynamic to the steam, without sharp outlines or pixelation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do both hands display five fingers with proper spacing and curvature, and are the knuckles and fingernails rendered with natural detail, without any fused, missing, or duplicated digits?",
    "explanation": "Each hand displays five fingers with appropriate spacing and natural curvature. Additionally, the knuckles and fingernails are depicted with appropriate detail and accuracy, free from abnormalities such as fusions or additional digits.",
    "answer": "Yes"
