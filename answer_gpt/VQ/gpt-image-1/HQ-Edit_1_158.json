      "question": "Does the silhouette of the woman maintain correct anatomical proportions and avoid geometric distortions such as misaligned limbs, unnatural bends, or missing body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the woman is stylized and simplified as part of a paper-cut illustration. The woman is depicted sitting in an armchair, reading a book. Despite the stylization, the anatomy is well-proportioned and there are no apparent geometric distortions, misaligned limbs, or missing body parts. The stylized form still conveys a clear sense of a seated human figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the enlarged book proportionally consistent with the womanâ€™s hands and arms, and does it not appear to float or clip through the chair or body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book the woman is holding is proportionally consistent with her hands and arms within the context of the stylized paper-cut art style. The book appears properly held by her arms and does not float or clip through the chair or her body. The illustration effectively uses the medium to maintain consistency in spatial relationships.",

      "question": "Are the lace details on the sweater seamlessly integrated with the original knit texture, showing no signs of unnatural edges, repeating patterns, or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a beautifully integrated lace texture throughout the woman's sweater. The lace pattern replaces the original knit texture found in Image A, and it appears intentionally designed as part of the paper-cut style. There are no signs of unnatural edges, repeating patterns, or inconsistencies in the material, fitting seamlessly with the artistic style chosen.",

      "question": "Do the simplified bookshelves maintain coherent shelf structure with aligned edges and realistic spacing between books, avoiding floating or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelves are simplified into a uniform pattern typical of stylized illustrations. The shelves are coherent, with aligned edges, and the spacing between books is depicted consistently. The design avoids floating or misaligned elements, providing a balanced backdrop consistent with artistic interpretations of bookshelves.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the antique-gold cardstock background uniformly textured and lit, with no abrupt edges or lighting mismatches that separate it from the central figure and other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an antique-gold cardstock background that is consistently textured and lit, in line with a paper-cut aesthetic. The background shows uniformity with no abrupt edges or lighting mismatches that would make it appear disconnected from the central figure and other elements. The design effectively integrates all components into a cohesive visual presentation.",
