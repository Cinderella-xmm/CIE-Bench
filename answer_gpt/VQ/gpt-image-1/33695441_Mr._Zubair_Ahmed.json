    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the steps now display a series of uniformly sized, overlapping scale-like segments that follow the spiral path without visible gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a spiral structure resembling a dragon or serpent, composed of overlapping scale-like segments. The scales follow the spiral path with consistency and without visible gaps or misalignments. This gives a cohesive appearance where the individual elements are seamlessly integrated into the overall form. By comparing it with real-life observations and designs of reptiles or mythological creatures, the representation aligns with such characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the railing now form a continuous, gently curving spine-like structure with consistent thickness and no abrupt changes in direction or width?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The railing in Image B has transformed into a spine-like structure, borrowing the anatomy of a dragon or serpentine creature. The spine curves gently around the spiral and maintains a consistent thickness throughout, with no abrupt changes in direction or width, reflecting a smooth and natural form. Such a depiction matches anatomical features of vertebrate spines often illustrated in art, providing continuity within the design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wooden patterns applied to the spine consistent in tone, grain, and texture with the original railing, and do they appear as an integral part of the structure rather than a separate overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden patterns resemble intricately carved details along the spine structure. Each part of this pattern seamlessly fits the contour of the spiral, and the texture appears deliberately crafted to seem like a natural extension of the anatomy depicted. The consistency in tone and texture suggests an integral part rather than an external application, which aligns with high-quality sculpture or detailed illustration techniques.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the stone-like ridges aligned along the outer edge of the spiral coils and smoothly integrated into the surface, without appearing detached or misaligned with the underlying form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image portrays stone-like ridges following the outer edge of the spiral with precision. Their integration into the coil structure is smooth and adheres to the natural curve and alignment expected from such designs. There are no apparent detachments or misalignments as seen in less refined works, indicating a high level of consistency and craftsmanship.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the spiral coils decrease in size proportionally toward the center, maintaining smooth curvature and even spacing without compression or stretching that distorts the spiral shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spiral coils decrease in size proportionally as they approach the center, maintaining a harmonious curvature and even spacing. This proportionate reduction reflects natural logarithmic spiral patterns found in nature, such as shells or hurricanes, and ensures there is no distortion in the depiction, maintaining visual symmetry and balance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do shadows and highlights on the scales, spine, and ridges follow the contours of the new surface structure, matching the direction and intensity of ambient light from above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The highlights and shadows in Image B adhere to the contours of the dragon-like scales, spine, and ridges effectively. They reflect an understanding of how light interacts with three-dimensional surfaces, following realistic shading principles akin to those used in detailed illustrations to add depth and dimension, closely matching the direction and intensity of ambient light from a conventional top-down source.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the edges of the scale segments, spinal bones, and stone ridges clearly defined and free from blurring, aliasing, or stair-stepping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the elements such as scale segments, spinal bones, and stone ridges possess clearly defined edges. There is an absence of blurring, aliasing, or stair-stepping artifacts, which suggests a high level of precision in the illustration technique. This level of detail is paramount for ensuring the artwork's readability and clarity, essential in professional digital illustrations.",
