    "Question": "Q1: Does the LEGO version of the military ship maintain its original shape and structural proportions without visible distortions or misaligned brick patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO military ship is composed of recognizable, consistent shapes typical for LEGO models, maintaining structural proportions with no visible distortions. The bricks are well-aligned, contributing to a visually coherent representation of a ship.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the LEGO-rendered ocean waves shaped in a way that mimics natural wave motion, without appearing overly rigid or uniformly flat?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO ocean waves in Image B are constructed using uniformly flat bricks. While LEGO inherently has limitations in mimicking natural curves, the representation does not mimic natural wave motion and appears rigid.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the LEGO accessories used for the boat deck properly scaled and positioned to match the size and perspective of the character and the surrounding scene?",
    "explanation": "The scale and positioning of the LEGO accessories on the boat deck in Image B appear consistent, matching the size and perspective of the character and the surrounding scene, maintaining proper proportion and alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the LEGO-textured life vest and shirt retain their original colors and show no signs of unnatural texture repetition, pixelation, or mismatched edges?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO-textured life vest and shirt with clear, consistent coloring typical of LEGO, without any signs of texture repetition, pixelation, or mismatched edges. These elements retain their original appearance effectively.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO model positioned on a shelf that appears structurally sound and spatially coherent, with appropriate shadows and depth cues?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO model in Image B is placed on a shelf with clear structural integrity and spatial coherence, supported by appropriate shadows and depth cues that enhance the perception of a real physical model.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, misaligned bricks, or missing pieces in the LEGO model that break the illusion of a cohesive construction?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the LEGO model shows no visible artifacts like jagged lines, misaligned bricks, or missing pieces, thereby maintaining the illusion of a cohesive and well-constructed model.",
    "answer": "No"
