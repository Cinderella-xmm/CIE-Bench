    "Question": "Q1: Does the crystal cloche have smooth, continuous curvature with natural light refraction and no visible seams or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "The glass cloche in Image B appears to have a smooth, continuous curvature, indicative of a well-crafted glass dome. The natural light refraction on the surface of the cloche shows realistic behavior, suggesting no visible seams or jagged edges. The highlights on the glass are consistent with how light should interact with a rounded transparent object.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the grassy mound have natural undulations, consistent grass coverage, and a seamless transition to the birdhouse base without gaps or floating sections?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the grassy mound has natural undulations and a consistent grass texture covering the surface. The transition of this grass mound to the base of the castle is seamless, with no visible gaps or floating sections, enhancing the authenticity of the model's setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Do all added elements (cloche, flowers, creatures, mound) respond to light consistently with the same direction and intensity as the original birdhouse and background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, all added elements such as the cloche, flowers, creatures, and grassy mound appear to respond to light consistently with the direction and intensity. This consistency with the pre-existing elements like the birdhouse and background is evident from the uniform shadow casting and light interaction throughout the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
