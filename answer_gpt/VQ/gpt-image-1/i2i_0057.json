      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse robot maintain the same posture and appear structurally consistent with the cow's original position and stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the biomechanical horse robot is grazing with its head lowered, while the cow in Image A appears to be walking down the road. The stance and posture of the robot and the cow are distinctly different. The robot's position suggests an animal at rest, whereas the cow is in motion, indicating that their positions are not structurally consistent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the materials of the biomechanical horse robot, specifically the silver-white metallic shell and exposed joint mechanisms, seamlessly integrated into the rural setting without looking out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a biomechanical horse robot with a futuristic and metallic design, contrasting with the natural elements of the rural scenery. The grassy landscape and trees evoke a typical countryside setting, where such a technologically advanced figure may not blend in seamlessly due to material contrast with the natural environment.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the textures of the biomechanical horse robot, including the metallic shell and joints, appear natural and detailed without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture of the biomechanical horse robot in Image B is detailed, with various mechanical parts and a well-defined metallic sheen. These elements are consistent with a realistic depiction of robotics and do not show any unnatural artifacts in terms of texture complexity and clarity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical characteristics of the biomechanical horse robot, like its size relative to the road and grass, realistic and logically consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the biomechanical horse robot appear consistent with realistic expectations for a horse-sized figure. It is proportionate to the road and grass, not appearing oversized or undersized relative to these natural surroundings, making it logically consistent in scale.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the addition of the biomechanical horse robot preserve the visual plausibility of the scene, meaning does it not disrupt the natural appearance and flow of the road, grass, and trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the biomechanical horse robot in Image B is detailed and proportionate, its futuristic design contrasts with the rural setting. This steel and mechanical design disrupts the natural appearance and flow inherent in the scene containing trees, grass, and a winding road, affecting the cohesive natural appearance.",
