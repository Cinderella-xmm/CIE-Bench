    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the creature added to the image appear naturally integrated with the temple and surrounding jungle, without any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a creature that resembles a temple is depicted, situated on an empty background without the jungle context from Image A. Given this environment, the creature is not designed with integration into the temple and jungle scene; it seems stylistically distinct and lacks the lush context present in Image A. The creature appears as a standalone illustration rather than being naturally blended into a jungle setting, which would require careful integration to avoid unnatural textures or artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the creature's design reflect the temple's shape and textures accurately, maintaining structural coherence and avoiding distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B is designed to resemble a temple structure with clear geometric shapes such as steps, symmetry, and a small upper structure that mimics the style seen in Image A's temple. The design maintains structural coherence as it uses shapes that are reminiscent of those found in ancient pyramids or temples, accurately reflecting the form without unnecessary distortion.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the custom-designed orb or capsule at the creature's feet visually consistent with the temple's architectural details and natural elements, without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orb found next to the creature in Image B appears to be stylized with intricate patterns similar to those that might be seen in art or architecture. While it does not directly integrate with the architectural style of the temple, the orb maintains intricate designs and is rendered with detail, ensuring visual consistency without lost details or unnatural textures.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the addition of the creature and the custom-designed orb maintain the scene's overall authenticity and natural appearance, without disrupting the harmony of the jungle and temple setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setting in Image B lacks the jungle and temple context found in Image A, as the creature is illustrated in a different context that does not include environmental scenery. This abstract and character-focused illustration diverges from the natural and historic appearance of Image A entirely, failing to maintain or contribute to the authenticity and harmony of the jungle and temple setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the creature's invented name and elemental type displayed clearly beside or beneath it, without interfering with the visual quality or introducing any distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's name 'STELZAD' and type 'MYSTIC' are displayed clearly below the illustration. This text does not interfere with the visual quality and complements the design without being distracting. The positioning and font style are coherent with the illustrationâ€™s theme.",
