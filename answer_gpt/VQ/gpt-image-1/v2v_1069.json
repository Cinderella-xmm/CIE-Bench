      "question": "Does the transition from the ceiling fan to the snow globe maintain structural coherence without any visible distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling fan is housed within a snow globe, which requires a smooth transition in terms of scale and positioning. The fan appears seamlessly integrated into the snow globe's environment with no visible distortion or break in coherence. This integration suggests a natural setting for the fan, maintaining structural integrity and avoiding any odd warping or mismatched textures, and the fan's design remains consistent and natural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the fan preserved within the snow globe's interior, avoiding any loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the fan inside a snow globe with clear details visible, such as the shape of the fan blades and the central hub of the fan. Despite being encased in a snow globe, the visual representation of the fan remains sharp and detailed, with no blurring or unnatural textures impacting its appearance. This suggests that the fan's details are well-preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the exterior setting with soft lighting and a warm background complement the snow globe scene naturally, enhancing the overall realism and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe is set against a warm, softly lit background that enhances the feeling of coziness and shelter. This warm hue complements the snow globe and its contents, enhancing the realism of the scene by creating a comforting atmosphere. The lighting seems intentional and integral to the overall aesthetic, supporting the notion that it fits the snow globe's presentation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the snow globe and its contents physically plausible, with no distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, the snow globe appears with typical spherical proportions, and the fan inside fits comfortably without any indication of distortion or geometric inconsistency. The symmetry of the globe and the regularity of the fan's shape contribute to a realistic presentation, suggesting the proportions of both the globe and the fan are plausible.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the light passing through the snow globe create delicate shimmering effects on nearby surfaces that appear authentic and do not disrupt the scene's overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting through the snow globe does not explicitly suggest dynamic shimmering effects on nearby surfaces. Instead, the focus is on the interior of the globe and the snowflakes that suggest a gentle snowfall, while the lighting subtly highlights the scene. Without actual shimmering as a focal effect, it does not disrupt the globe's authenticity or overall scene's believability.",
