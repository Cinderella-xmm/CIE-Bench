      "question": "Are the facial features on the central body aligned with the original angular design and free from visible texture artifacts or shape distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central body of the drone in Image B features a face-like design with angular elements, consistent with its stylized robotic character. The facial features integrate well with the overall angular design, offering a cohesive appearance without clear texture artifacts or distortions. This is achieved by using sharp lines and geometric shapes that complement the angular nature of the body's design, suggesting a well-executed alignment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the arms formed from rotor blades have consistent proportions and smooth joints that suggest functional rotation without visible warping or breakage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms are depicted by the rotor blade structures attached to the body. These appear to have smooth connections that suggest a functional joint mechanism, essential for rotation. The joints and proportions are consistent, avoiding visible warping or breakage, which points toward a credible envisioning of mechanical functionality, despite the cartoonish style of the depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the spider-like legs connected at the original landing gear locations and do they display coherent joint structures without gaps or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spider-like legs in Image B are drawn with multiple articulated segments that appear to be connected logically at what could be perceived as landing gear locations on a typical drone. There are coherent joint structures depicted, without awkward gaps or segments that appear to malfunction, creating a sense of completeness and functional design, appropriate within a stylized artistic interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the lighting on the drone consistent with the futuristic cityscape background, showing appropriate metallic reflections and no harsh transitions between the drone and environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting on the drone in Image B blends well with the darker color palette of the futuristic cityscape background. The metallic reflections on the drone's surfaces are subtle and consistent with the ambient lighting conditions depicted in the environment. Harsh transitions that would disrupt the visual coherence between the drone and the background are not evident, indicating a well-integrated portrayal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the speech bubble positioned near the robotic face with clear, legible text and no overlap with drone components or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubble is placed strategically near the drone's face, ensuring that the text remains legible and clear. It's positioned at a distance that doesn't overlap with any of the drone's components or interfere with the background elements, maintaining clarity and enabling the message to be easily interpreted in the context of the illustration.",
