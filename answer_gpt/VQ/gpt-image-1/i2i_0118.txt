    "Question": "Q1: Does the character seamlessly integrate into the tablet screen without any visible gaps or unnatural edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character, which is Pikachu, seems to be emerging from a tablet screen. The integration appears smooth, with clean lines and no visible gaps or distortion between Pikachu and the tablet. The character seems well-integrated, as common sense tells us there should be no visible glitches or abrupt transitions when a character is meant to appear as part of the scene. This seamless transition suggests a crafted attempt at creating a 3D popping effect, which reflects well-done digital compositing.",
