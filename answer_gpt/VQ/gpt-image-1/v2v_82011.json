      "question": "Do the bold calligraphic outlines and flat planes of color on the dolls' clothing and hair maintain the original proportions and positions without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bold calligraphic outlines are consistent with the contours seen in traditional Ukiyo-e artwork, maintaining overall proportions and positions. The flat planes of color are smoothly applied, with colors and shapes reflecting the original design without introducing distortions. The overall structure remains consistent with realistic proportions, despite stylistic changes.",

      "question": "Are the textures of the dolls' skin and hair free from unnatural artifacts and maintain a natural appearance after the style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is transformed into a flat, non-textured style typical of Ukiyo-e art, which doesn't emphasize texture but rather smooth color transitions. This style transition does not create unnatural artifacts, as the appearance remains consistent with the artistic genre’s intent, giving it a cohesive yet stylized presentation resembling traditional Japanese prints.",

      "question": "Do the dolls' limbs and facial features retain their structural integrity and do not appear deformed after the style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dolls with structural integrity preserved through clear outlines and proportions. The limbs and features maintain their original shapes, enhanced by the Ukiyo-e style’s unique depiction, which includes stylized yet proportionate representations and avoids distortion.",

      "question": "Does the subtly patterned, simplified background complement the dolls without disrupting the visual flow and maintaining the overall sense of reality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a simplified cloud pattern consistent with traditional Japanese design elements, harmoniously supporting the foreground subjects. This aesthetic is non-intrusive and well-integrated, maintaining visual flow and enhancing the stylized representation without challenging reality as defined by the artistic style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the dolls’ poses from Image A, ensuring consistency in their actions and stances vital to narrative coherence. The poses are translated well into the Ukiyo-e style, allowing the scene's intent and positioning to match traditional artistic interpretations, thus enhancing visual credibility within the new context.",
