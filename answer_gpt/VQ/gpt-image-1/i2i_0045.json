      "question": "Are the girl, stone platform, and frisbee free of unnatural distortions or artifacts, appearing structurally coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a girl throwing a frisbee while standing on a stone platform. Examining the elements for structual coherence, the girl's pose is natural with arms outstretched as might be expected while throwing a frisbee, and there is no evident distortion. The stone platform appears uniformly solid without irregularities, and the frisbee is distinctly round and well-defined in motion. Given these observations, all elements appear to be free of unnatural distortions or artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the grass and blue sky background integrate smoothly with the foreground elements, avoiding obvious seams or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image presents a clear blue sky and expansive grass field as the background, which visually blends well with the foreground elements like the girl, stone platform, and frisbee. There are no visible seams or abrupt changes between the background and foreground, nor do the textures of the background appear out of place when considering the overall composition. Hence, the integration appears smooth.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the girl, stone platform, and frisbee adhere to the golden ratio principles in their positioning, creating a balanced and visually credible composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual analysis of the image, the girl, stone platform, and frisbee are arranged in a composition that appears balanced. The girl's position is central enough to draw viewer attention, and the frisbee's placement captures motion effectively. While specific golden ratio calculations aren't possible from viewing the image, the arrangement feels visually pleasing and credible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details like the texture of the girl's clothing, the surface of the stone platform, and the frisbee preserved clearly without degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the image, the girl's clothing shows clear edges and folds, indicating well-preserved texture. The stone platform's surface is sharply detailed without blurring or pixelation, and the frisbee appears vivid in color with a smooth texture visible in its structure. These observations suggest that the details are well-maintained without degradation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting on the girl, stone platform, and frisbee match the lighting conditions of the new grass and sky background, avoiding mismatched shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting across the image shows consistent brightness that aligns well with a naturally lit outdoor scene. There are no mismatched shadows or highlights when comparing the lighting on the girl, stone platform, and frisbee with the grassy field and clear sky. The even lighting suggests that all elements are exposed to a similar light source, creating a unified lighting condition.",
