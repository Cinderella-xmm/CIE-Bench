      "question": "Are the transitions between the man's clothing and the cow's fur smooth and free of unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the man's clothing and the cow's fur involves combining two distinct textures: fabric and animal fur. A smooth transition would mean there are no sharp edges or mismatched textures that appear unnatural. The visual cues suggest that the blending has been done smoothly, as there are no visible cutting lines or texture mismatches at the transition points.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the combined figure, including the size of the horns relative to the body, appear physically plausible and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a figure that combines human clothing with features of a cow. For proportions to be plausible, the horns should appear in a size that is consistent with the cow's size. The body proportions should be anatomically reasonable, without distortions. The horns appear appropriately sized for the cow's body, which indicates a plausible proportion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the details of the man's white coat and the cow's fur well-preserved and free from unnatural blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observing the man's white coat and cow's fur for detail preservation means ensuring there's no loss of detail or quality, which typically appears as blurring or pixelation. The coat's texture and cow fur are sharp and clear, avoiding such quality issues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the posture of the combined figure, including the positioning of the legs and head, appear natural and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The posture in Image B consists of a figure standing and walking. Its posture should align logically with what is expected from the man and the cow in motion. Comparing with Image A, the posture remains consistent, maintaining a natural walking movement without awkward positioning or alignment issues.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement of the combined figure within the scene, including its interaction with the grass and background, appear visually credible and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the placement needs to harmonize with the scene, meaning the figure should appear as though it belongs, without awkward overlaps or distortions with the grass and background. The figure seamlessly integrates with the surroundings, showing no visual incongruities that betray editing.",
