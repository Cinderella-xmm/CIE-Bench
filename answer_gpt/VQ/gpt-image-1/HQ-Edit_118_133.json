      "question": "Does the surface of the teapot’s body exhibit a consistent, smooth high-gloss ceramic finish without visible texture artifacts or abrupt transitions from the original metallic look?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a teapot with a smooth, high-gloss finish that suggests ceramic material. The visual cues indicate a consistent finish without abrupt transitions from metallic textures that were present in Image A, where the teapot exhibited intricate metal engravings and reflections. The ceramic finish in Image B shows a uniformity indicative of a high-quality material without any texture artifacts commonly found when transitioning from metal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the wick positioned at the tip of the former spout location in a straight, vertical orientation that aligns naturally with the candle design, without bending or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wick is visually positioned at the tip of the teapot's spout location in a straight, vertical orientation. This placement aligns naturally with the aesthetic of turning a teapot into a candle holder, especially given the verticality of typical candle wicks. There are no signs of bending or deformation that would detract from the candle design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the handle now rendered as a solid gold-colored accent with no visible remnants of the original wood or metal, and does it retain its original curvature without warping or unnatural thickness changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle in Image B is depicted as a solid gold-colored accent, differing from Image A, where the handle had a wooden appearance. It maintains its original curvature and thickness, aligning with the teapot's design while completely altering the material appearance to gold. This transition reflects the theme of luxury without any visual distortions or remnants of its prior material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns around the base of the teapot evenly spaced, proportionally scaled, and stylistically consistent with the existing engraved motifs, without overlapping or distorting the base structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns present around the base are evenly spaced and proportionally scaled, maintaining consistency with the surrounding motifs. This preserves the integrity of the teapot's design, ensuring that the patterns do not overlap or distort the base structure, which contrasts Image A’s detailed metallic engravings that cover most of the surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text \"Eternal Elegance Candle\" placed centrally on the front face of the teapot in a flowing script font that matches the luxury theme, with no pixelation, shadowing, or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is placed prominently in the center of the teapot's face, utilizing a flowing script font that aligns with the luxury and elegance theme. It contrasts against the teapot's surface without any visible pixelation, shadowing, or clipping artifacts, ensuring a clear and professional appearance suitable for a luxury item.",
