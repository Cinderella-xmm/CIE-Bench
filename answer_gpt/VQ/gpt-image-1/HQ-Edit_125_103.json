      "question": "Does the transformed teapot maintain a uniform cylindrical shape with smooth, continuous surfaces and no visible geometric distortions or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cylindrical object which appears to be a tea container maintains a smooth, continuous surface characteristic of a cylindrical shape. There are no visible signs of distortions or irregularities; the surface is depicted with clean lines, suggesting a uniform shape. The uniformity is maintained due to consistent lighting and even curvature, making the object appear undistorted and regular.",

      "question": "Are the golden foil floral patterns clearly embossed with consistent depth, proper lighting interaction, and no signs of blurred edges or artificial textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden floral patterns on the cylindrical container appear to be embossed. The interaction of light creates a subtle shadow effect along the edges, giving the patterns depth and suggesting an embossed feature. The edges are sharp with no signs of blurring or artificial textures, indicating good craftsmanship and detail in the embossing.",

      "question": "Are the redesigned cups stacked in a stable, physically plausible manner with matching rim sizes and lids that fit securely without gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three bowls or cups are stacked on top of one another. Each cup appears to have rims and lids that fit securely, showing no visible gaps or signs of misalignment. The edges of the stacked cups match in size, which supports stability in their arrangement. This arrangement suggests a stable, physically plausible stacking system.",

      "question": "Is the Japanese calligraphy positioned at the top of the packaging with natural brushstroke variation and clear legibility, without clipping or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Japanese calligraphy is positioned at the top of the tea canister. The calligraphy is presented in a manner that shows natural variation in brush strokes, indicating a handwritten style. The calligraphy is clear and legible, with no visible signs of clipping or distortion, suggesting careful attention to detail in its representation.",

      "question": "Does the bamboo motif along the side have consistent node spacing, natural grain texture, and smooth edges without repeating or distorted segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bamboo motif is distinctly patterned along the side of the tea canister. The motif exhibits consistent node spacing and grain texture that resembles natural bamboo. The edges of the motif are smooth, and there are no visible repeating or distorted segments, indicating a detailed and careful design.",

      "question": "Is the surface beneath the tea set completely flat, uniformly white, and free from any unintended shadows, textures, or reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the set is depicted without any noticeable shadows, textures, or reflections. The surface appears to be flat and uniformly of a white or light color, consistent with a studio photography setup intended to isolate the objects for emphasis. This suggests an absence of any unintended visual defects.",
