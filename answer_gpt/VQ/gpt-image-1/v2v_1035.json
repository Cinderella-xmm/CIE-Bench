      "question": "Do the Russian nesting dolls maintain the recognizable shape and proportions of the giraffe without introducing unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Russian nesting dolls are stylized representations of giraffes. They maintain the giraffe's key features such as the long neck, ears, and pattern of patches. While stylized, they don't exhibit any unnatural geometric distortions; rather, they are artistically simplified while preserving the essence of a giraffe's anatomy. This analysis involves recognizing the stylized yet intact representation of a giraffe's form in relation to typical giraffe proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the Russian nesting dolls consistent with the giraffe's fur pattern, avoiding unnatural or overly smooth surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows Russian nesting dolls with textures that mimic the pattern of a giraffe's fur, which consists of irregular brown patches. The dolls have a smooth surface typical for such items, contrasting with the actual fur texture seen in Image A. While smoothness is expected in crafted items, the textural representation in the edited image is consistent in its thematic portrayal of a giraffe's pattern without unnatural simplification.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the different sizes of the Russian nesting dolls smooth, without visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Russian nesting dolls vary in size from largest to smallest, exhibiting a smooth transition without visible seams or unnatural edges. This aligns with the typical construction of nesting dolls where each successive size fits seamlessly within the previous one. The artist ensures a coherent scaling without disrupting the visual harmony of the set.",

      "question": "Does the arrangement of the Russian nesting dolls on the wooden table look balanced and natural, without any dolls appearing to float or overlap unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the dolls are placed side by side with increasing size, standing firmly on a flat surface. This arrangement is visually balanced and natural, suggesting solid positioning without any of them floating or overlapping in an unrealistic manner. The reasoning is based on observing consistent spatial distribution typical of a set display.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the Russian nesting dolls and the wooden table consistent with the lighting in the original image, avoiding any unrealistic highlights or dark spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is indoor with warm tones, casting soft shadows consistent with the indoor setting. Image A, showing the giraffe outdoors with natural lighting, serves as a different contextual background. Therefore, within its own setting, Image B reflects consistent lighting and shadows, avoiding any unrealistic highlights or dark spots on the wooden surface and the dolls.",
