      "question": "Does the area around the apples show any unnatural textures or artifacts after adding the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' have been added to the image. The text is distinct from the background and doesn't appear to interfere or overlay with the apples themselves, which are the primary subjects in the image. Upon examination of the areas surrounding the text, there aren't any noticeable artifacts or distortions that would suggest any unnatural textures have been introduced. The wooden surface on which the apples sit, and the defocused background remain visually consistent and natural-looking.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the fonts for \"Fresh\" and \"Sweet\" appear visually consistent with the background image, avoiding any visual disruption or inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fonts for 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' in Image B are white and straightforward, featuring a clean and sans-serif style that provides good contrast against the slightly darker wooden surface and natural colors of the background. The text does not clash with the image's aesthetic and remains visually consistent as it avoids drawing undue attention away from the main subject. Therefore, the fonts are consistent with the background and maintain the image's visual appeal without causing disruptions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the shapes of the apples preserved without distortion after incorporating the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' have been positioned outside the boundaries of the apples. The apples are fully visible, and their shapes remain consistent with how apples are typically perceived: sphere-like with natural curves. There is no indication that the text has led to any warping, cropping, or distortion of the apples themselves.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the alignment of the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right properly aligned so that it doesn't alter the apples' structure or visual balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' is placed at strategic positions in Image B, forming a diagonal layout from bottom left to top right. This alignment ensures that the text stays clear of the apples and doesn't interfere with their structure or the viewer's line of sight along the apples. The balance and composition of the image remain intact as the text complements rather than disrupts.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the apples, including their speckles and light reflections, remained clear and undamaged after adding the text “Fresh” and “Sweet”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, despite the addition of text, the apples' details like their speckles, texture, and the way light reflects off them seem clear and unaltered. The text does not cover or interfere with these details. The apples retain their realistic appearance, with all the intricate details preserved, indicating that the text addition did not damage these aspects.",
