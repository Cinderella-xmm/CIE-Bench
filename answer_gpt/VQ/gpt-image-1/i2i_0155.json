      "question": "Does the addition of 'Breathe' at the top left corner blend naturally with the image without introducing any visible artifacts or disrupting the plant's structural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the text 'Breathe' is positioned in a space where it does not overlap or cover any vital aspects of the plant. The font is clear and distinct, matching the tranquil theme suggested by the image. There are no visible artifacts or disruptions to the plant's appearance, preserving the integrity of its natural form.",

      "question": "Is the inclusion of 'Calm' at the bottom right corner naturally integrated into the scene, ensuring that the window frame's geometry remains intact and visually plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Calm' is positioned at the bottom right corner where it is clear but does not interfere with the window frame's structure or create visual inconsistencies. The text placement seems well-considered to maintain the image's structural integrity and natural flow.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the light reflections and shadows on the leaves natural and consistent with the lighting source, unaffected by the added text 'Breathe' and 'Calm'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the plant in Image B, the shadows and light reflections on the leaves appear consistent with the natural sunlight coming from the window, unaffected by the text additions. This indicates that the text does not disrupt the lighting dynamics within the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the texture details of the terracotta pot and its saucer remain authentic and detailed, with no degradation or introduction of unnatural textures due to the addition of text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the terracotta pot and saucer appear with rich texture details similar to those found in high-quality photography. The addition of text does not lead to any degradation or introduction of artificial textures, ensuring the pot remains realistic and credible.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the positioning of 'Breathe' and 'Calm' preserved the plant's form and the window's symmetry, avoiding any distortion or disruption in proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text positioning in Image B is strategic; 'Breathe' and 'Calm' are located in areas that do not conflict with the plant's shape or the symmetry of the window. This ensures the visual balance and symmetry are well-maintained.",
