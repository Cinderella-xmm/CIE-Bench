      "question": "Does the standing cat’s body exhibit a uniformly soft, plush-like texture with exaggeratedly round and fluffy features throughout, without any visible patches of natural fur or inconsistent material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing cat clearly displays a plush-like texture, with uniformly soft and round features typical of plush toys. The surface is consistent and lacks the varied texture of natural fur, indicating it is entirely a plush figure without any visible patches or inconsistent transitions. Such features are common in toy designs intended to have a cute and exaggerated appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes of both cats replaced with small, shiny, circular button-like objects and the noses with flat, felt-like shapes that are proportionally appropriate and seamlessly integrated into the plush form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of both cats are depicted as small, shiny, circular button-like objects, and their noses appear as flat, felt-like shapes. These elements are typical of plush toys, where features are often simplified and cartoonish in appearance. The integration of these objects is seamless within the plush fabric, adding to the aesthetic appeal without seeming out of place.",

      "question": "Is the red shopping cart correctly scaled to fit the toy-sized cats and does it retain proper geometric structure with undistorted bars, wheels, and handle, without any broken or warped components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red shopping cart is proportionally scaled to fit the toy-sized cats. It maintains a proper geometric structure, with bars, wheels, and handles appearing undistorted. The cart components look intact and appropriately sized for the context, providing functional and aesthetic compatibility with the size of the plush cat figures.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is composed of vivid and lush green foliage, which appears to have natural textures and appropriately distributed lighting.

      "question": "Does the standing cat’s front paws properly grip the handle of the trolley in a stable and anatomically plausible manner for a plush toy figure, without unnatural bending or stretching of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing cat’s front paws are positioned to grip the handle of the trolley in a manner that is stable and plausible for a plush toy. The limb positioning is depicted without unrealistic bending or stretching, fitting within the anatomical limitations and design of plush toys. The pose appears deliberate and designed for the interaction with the shopping cart handle.",
