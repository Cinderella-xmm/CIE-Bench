      "question": "Does the perfume bottle appear to be constructed from Lego bricks without any visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To analyze Image B, the perfume bottle is composed of Lego bricks. This design choice is executed well as it fits the typical Lego aesthetics, capturing the polygonal facets of the bottle cap and the geometric pattern of the bottle body using brick assembly. There are no visible textures or artifacts in this context; it's coherent with the Lego brick theme. The smooth finish and structured layout inherent to Lego adaptation are present, successfully disguising any peculiar artifacts that might appear unnatural.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the fabric background transformed into Lego bricks maintain a natural appearance without any obvious distortions or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric background is replaced with Lego bricks as well. These bricks manage to mimic the undulating nature of fabric through varying levels and stepped areas crafted with bricks. However, since Lego bricks inherently introduce a blocky appearance, this results in a rather stylized interpretation rather than natural fabric waves. Yet, within the realm of what is achievable with Lego constructs, there are no severe distortions or unnatural shapes that would seem out of place for a Lego composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the perfume bottle and the fabric background preserved, avoiding any distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases both the perfume bottle and background as systems of Lego bricks. The proportions—i.e., the relative sizes and shapes—remain consistent and logical, echoing the original object design despite being translated into Lego forms. While the Lego bricks impart a blocky aesthetic, the original contours and proportions are distinctly retained, with no obvious evidence of distorted geometric manipulation that would detract from physical rationality.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the edited image, with the perfume bottle and fabric background made of Lego bricks, retain visual credibility and coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image exhibits a well-thought-out transformation of objects and background into Lego constructs. This cohesive design preserves the essential elements of spatial composition and layout from common product photography. The repetitive Lego pattern is uniformly applied to both the bottle and the surface, maintaining a consistent style and credibility within the realm of creative design without disrupting coherence.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the perfume bottle and the fabric background accurately represented in the Lego brick form without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, while it is creatively rendered using Lego bricks, the nature of such bricks inherently simplifies fine details due to their blocky nature. Compared to Image A, some subtle intricacies, particularly the fine texture and delicacy, are lost in translation to the Lego format, which favors wider interpretation and simplification over precision. Hence, there's a loss of intricate detail that naturally occurs when converting to Lego bricks.",
