      "question": "Do the blue-purple neon lights on the keyboard seamlessly blend with the surrounding environment, avoiding any unnatural glow or oversaturation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue-purple neon lights are vivid yet not excessively bright or overly saturated. They appear to be complementary to the overall dark ambiance, which suggests a night-time setting or low-light environment. The lighting effect does not dominate the image, allowing it to integrate naturally with the rest of the scene. Therefore, the neon lights do not exhibit unnaturally bright or oversaturated characteristics within the image.",

      "question": "Are the glowing fingertips free of unnatural textures, keeping the hands' structure realistic and preserving the natural texture and curvature of the fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fingertips are illuminated by the keyboard's neon lights, showing a smooth and consistent glow that follows the natural contour of the fingers. The lighting effect highlights the natural texture and curvature without introducing any irregularities or unnatural textures. The fingers maintain their realistic human structure with no visible deformation, suggesting that the lighting enhancement was done with care to preserve authenticity.",

      "question": "Does the keyboard retain its original shape and functionality, with no visible distortion or breaking of keys despite the addition of neon lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keyboard's structure, including its shape and the arrangement of keys, remains intact even with the addition of neon lighting. The lighting appears as an overlay, complementing the keys without causing any distortion or disruption of their physical form, implying that the keyboard's design and functionality remain visually unaffected.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the details on the laptopâ€™s surface and key caps preserved their sharpness, with no blurring or pixelation caused by the added neon effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details of the laptop, particularly around the key caps and the surrounding surface, appear sharp and well-defined. The neon lighting effect does not seem to interfere with the clarity or sharpness of these features, maintaining a clear edge and distinct separation between elements. Thus, the neon enhancement hasn't resulted in pixelation or blurring.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the blue-purple neon lights on the keyboard interact correctly with the rest of the scene's lighting, creating believable reflections or shadows where appropriate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue-purple neon lights interact with the scene to produce a realistic illumination effect. The light reflects appropriately on the keys and the surface, casting subtle shadows and reflections that align with the expected behavior of light in such a setting. This indicates a proper understanding of light dynamics in the image, which ensures the scene's overall believability.",
