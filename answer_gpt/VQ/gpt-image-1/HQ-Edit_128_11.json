      "question": "Does the enhanced chandelier retain its symmetrical structure and realistic crystal texture, with no visible distortion or irregularities in its shape or lighting reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chandelier is depicted with a symmetrical structure, as the armature design radiates evenly around its axis. The graphical representation of the chandelier maintains a consistent-sized and proportionate hanging design similar to that of traditional crystal chandeliers. The texture mimics realism through shading that suggests crystal facets and reflections. These visual cues aid in perceiving a coherently symmetrical and undistorted form, essential for maintaining the chandelier's aesthetic appeal and structural integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the newly added patterns on the ceiling consistent in style and scale with the existing decorative elements, and do they blend seamlessly without creating visual breaks or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ceiling in Image B features intricate patterns that are coherent with traditional interior decoration found in classical theaters. These ornamental patterns are consistent in style with the rest of the decorative elements, providing a harmonious and cohesive appearance. The seamless integration is observed through lack of visual breaks or awkward joins, sustaining unity and flow in the design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the silhouette figures in the audience retain recognizable human postures and relative spacing, avoiding unnatural clustering or elongation that would compromise spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the audience is depicted as silhouette figures, maintaining a consistent scale and posture indicative of seated individuals in a concert setting. The spacing between silhouettes is regular and maintains plausible human dimensions and distribution, avoiding any unrealistic clustering or distortion, thereby preserving spatial logic and coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sepia tone evenly applied across all surfaces, maintaining visible texture differences between materials such as the wooden floor, piano finish, and gilded ceiling, without introducing muddy or oversaturated areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sepia tone in Image B is applied uniformly, creating an antique aesthetic that does not compromise the clarity of different textures. The wooden floor, piano surface, and gilded ceiling are visually distinguishable due to the careful application of shading and contrast, ensuring that no area appears oversaturated or lacks texture definition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the grand piano centered correctly on the stage with accurate perspective, intact legs, and natural shadowing that matches the light source from above, without any deformation or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grand piano is strategically placed at the center of the stage and rendered with accurate perspective relative to the stage's vanishing point. The legs of the piano are intact and consistent with realistic proportions. The shadowing underneath the piano aligns with the light source direction from the chandelier above, preventing a floating illusion and ensuring groundedness within the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the text “AN EVENING OF CLASSICAL MAJESTY” clearly visible at the top of the image, properly aligned within the frame, and rendered with crisp edges and consistent stroke weight, without interfering with background details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B, “AN EVENING OF CLASSICAL MAJESTY,” is prominently displayed at the top. It is well-aligned within the frame and executed in a manner that maintains edge sharpness and stroke consistency. Additionally, it doesn't overlap or obscure any critical background components, ensuring both the text and visual elements are distinctly perceivable.",
