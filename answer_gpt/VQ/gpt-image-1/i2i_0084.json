      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dog and its blue mat appear consistent with the lighting of a snowy mountain setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the observed shadows and highlights on the dog and the blue mat should be consistent with the natural lighting expected in an outdoor snowy environment. The lighting in such a setting is generally soft and diffused due to cloud cover and snow. The highlights on the dog's fur appear natural, suggesting a diffused light source. There is no harsh shadow that might indicate artificial manipulation. These observations match the expected conditions of snowy landscapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dog's fur retain its natural texture and detail without showing any unnatural artifacts after being placed in the snowy environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's fur needs to maintain the realistic texture and continuity seen in natural settings. The fur's coloration and the detail level are relevant, indicating a consistent integration. No blurring or pixelation artifacts are visible, which would suggest editing mishaps. The dog's fur still appears detailed and well-defined, retaining its natural appearance even in the transition to the snowy setting.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the size and proportions of the dog and its blue mat appropriately scaled in relation to the tent and other elements of the snowy campsite?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's size and the mat should logically fit within the context of the environment, indicating scale and proportion. The tent provides a reference for size. The dog and mat do not seem disproportionately large or small compared to the tent and surroundings, suggesting a proper scale, maintaining the realistic portrayal in the snowy campsite.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the dog and its blue mat smoothly integrated into the snowy mountain campsite without any visible jagged or unnatural lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, if the dog's edges and the mat were poorly integrated, jagged or hard lines would appear, disrupting the flow into the snowy setting. The edges here appear smooth and naturally blend into the background, indicating quality editing and integration, as no visible discrepancies highlight a separation between the objects and the snowy terrain.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dog's posture and the overall layout of the snowy campsite appear natural and free from distortion or unnatural positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's posture on the mat should be natural, reflecting a relaxed position typical for this context. The overall layout of the campsite, including the tent placement and snow coverage, should appear logical and consistent with a normal outdoor setup. The dog's posture and alignment within the scene seem appropriately aligned and naturally placed, with no indicators of distortion or awkward positioning.",
