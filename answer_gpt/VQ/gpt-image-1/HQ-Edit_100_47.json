      "question": "Does the mirror-like surface in the foreground reflect the sky, trees, and Eiffel Tower with clear, undistorted imagery and smooth texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground consists of a stylized depiction of Paris with a simplified design that resembles paper cutouts and lacks intricate details like reflections. Given the stylistic elements, such as monochromatic shading and minimalistic details, the design is not intended to portray realistic reflections of the sky, trees, or the Eiffel Tower, hence it does not display clear, undistorted imagery or a smooth texture typical of reflective surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the distant buildings and tree clusters positioned at distinct depth layers without overlapping or misaligned edges that suggest incorrect layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design is a paper-cut style artwork that creates layers using monochrome tones and outlines. The separation of elements is clear due to the distinct layer cuts and shadows used, ensuring that buildings and tree clusters are well defined within their respective layers, following a consistent visual logic of depth without misalignments.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the small pedestrian figures on the pathways have consistent proportions, recognizable body parts, and smooth textures without visible deformities or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of pedestrian figures in Image B is simplified, capturing them as small silhouette shapes without detailed features or textures, as part of the artistic style. Their proportions are consistent with the overall artistic intent, maintaining harmony in the stylized depiction without deformities or clipping artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dark frame with metallic edges present around the entire perimeter of the image, appearing solid and uniformly integrated without breaks or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a dark frame clearly visible around the entire perimeter of the image. This frame is consistent with the overall design, appearing solid, with even integration into the artwork without visible breaks or misalignments, enhancing the visual composition.",

      "question": "Are the engraved city names and coordinates along the frame legible, precisely aligned, and free from pixelation or uneven spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the city name 'PARIS' and the coordinates are clearly engraved at the bottom part of the frame. They are precisely aligned and legible, following the minimalist yet precise design theme of the image, with no pixelation or uneven spacing visible.",
