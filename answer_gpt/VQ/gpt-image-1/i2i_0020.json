      "question": "Are the red-and-gray train and STOP sign geometrically simplified without introducing distorted or broken shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red-and-gray train and STOP sign are illustrated using clean lines and simple geometric shapes. The STOP sign is a clear octagon with no distortion, and the train's exterior is streamlined, maintaining integrity without any broken or distorted lines. The geometric simplification aids in keeping the illustration visually coherent and aesthetically pleasing, consistent with a modern minimalist style.",

      "question": "Do the green mountain outlines and track lines look naturally integrated and consistent with the cool-toned minimalist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green mountain outlines are stylized with smooth, continuous curves, fitting well into a minimalist style dominated by cool tones. The track lines are straight and evenly spaced, contributing to the orderly and serene composition. These elements look intentionally simplified in a way that complements the rest of the illustration, which suggests a cohesive aesthetic characteristic of minimalist art, often emphasizing a limited color palette and simple shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the textures of the simplified train and STOP sign been maintained well enough to avoid loss of essential details and unnatural appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B uses a minimalist approach, which typically removes textural details, the essential elements of the train and STOP sign are preserved. The trainâ€™s windows and basic contour lines are depicted clearly, and the STOP sign retains its essential shape with adequate color differentiation. The choice of simplification respects the nature of both the train and the sign, avoiding an unnatural appearance by focusing on defining lines and colors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the minimalist illustration maintain the correct spatial relationship between the train, STOP sign, and tracks without disrupting visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial arrangement retains logical distances and sizes between the train, STOP sign, and tracks. The train appears on the tracks in parallel, the STOP sign is placed correctly alongside, and the tracks lead the viewer's eye in a coherent direction. The use of perspective and size relations in the illustration supports visual credibility by aligning with expected real-world spatial relationships, even within a stylized format.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cool-toned color palette remain consistent throughout the minimalist illustration, effectively supporting the traffic safety visual style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly features cool-toned colors, such as various shades of blue and green, along with contrasting red elements for the train and STOP sign. This palette choice not only supports the minimalist style but also highlights traffic safety elements, with red being a color strongly associated with attention and caution. The consistent use of these colors ensures a unified look while effectively drawing attention to important features, such as the STOP sign, in a way that reinforces the visual message of safety.",
