    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the bark textures on the logs continuous and aligned with the original log shapes, showing no abrupt edges or inconsistent scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bark textures appear continuous and follow the natural shapes of the logs. The details do not show any abrupt edges or inconsistent scaling, which indicates attention to detail in maintaining the integrity of the log shapes. The texture transition from one log to another seems smooth and coherent, implying that the edited textures were carefully mapped onto the log structures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glowing amber eyes fit precisely within the original window openings without distorting the surrounding log structure or spreading light beyond the intended area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing amber eyes in Image B are situated where the upper windows would be and seem to fit well within those openings. They do not appear to distort the log structure or extend their glow beyond the intended area, indicating careful placement and rendering to preserve the structure's integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the leafy canopy extend upward from the roof ridge in a natural, gravity-consistent manner, with leaves overlapping logically and not appearing suspended or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leafy canopy in Image B extends naturally from the roof ridge. The leaves and branches seem to follow a downward flow that is consistent with gravity, suggesting a realistic interpretation of foliage draping over a structure. The leaves overlap logically and do not appear to be unnaturally suspended or detached.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the vines and moss growing along the logs and roofline in a way that follows natural climbing patterns, with no flat, disconnected patches or unnatural straight lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the vines and moss follow natural climbing patterns along the logs and roofline. There are no visible flat or disconnected patches, and the vines do not form unnatural straight lines. This suggests that the vines and moss were rendered to simulate natural growth behavior.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the runes carved into the logs with consistent depth and alignment, following the roundness of the logs and not appearing as flat or misaligned symbols?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The runes on the logs appear to be carved with consistent depth and are aligned properly. They follow the curvature of the logs, avoiding the appearance of flat or misaligned symbols. This reflects a detailed integration of the runic design within the natural contours of the log surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the forest spirit faces positioned within the original garage door frames, with facial features properly scaled and energy trails flowing outward in a smooth, non-jagged manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The forest spirit faces are positioned within the original garage door frames in Image B. The facial features are scaled appropriately to fit within these frames, and the energy trails emanating from them flow outward smoothly, without jagged edges. This suggests a seamless integration within the design constraints of the original structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all structural components (logs, roof, canopy, vines, faces) connected seamlessly without gaps, floating elements, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all structural components such as the logs, roof, canopy, vines, and faces are interconnected cohesively. There are no visible gaps, floating elements, or distorted geometry, indicating a harmonious blend of all elements in the composition of the image.",
