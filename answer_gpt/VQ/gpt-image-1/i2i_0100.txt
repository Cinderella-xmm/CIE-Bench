    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges of the sinks and cabinets accurately depicted without any broken or warped shapes in both the top-down and angled side views?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lines and shapes forming the sinks and cabinets are clean and well-defined, consistent with technical drawings, suggesting accurate depiction. Analyzing Image A, the visual cues indicate a real-life bathroom setup with clear and straight lines. Comparatively, both images maintain consistency in the depiction structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the shadows and light reflections on the countertop, mirrors, and cabinetry appear natural and consistent with the lighting sources in both the top-down and angled side views?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses line art which doesn't cater inherently to light reflections or shadows, as it focuses on structure rather than lighting details. Image A shows natural lighting effects where the direction and intensity of light are captured realistically on surfaces. Comparing both, Image B only outlines objects without showing shadow or light consistency.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the texture of the marble countertop and the finish of the white cabinetry remain clear and authentic in both the top-down and angled side views?",
    "explanation": "Image B, being a line drawing, does not depict texture explicitly, focusing more on the structural aspects rather than material finish. In Image A, textures are clearly visible with realistic marble patterns on the countertop and cabinetry finish. Image B lacks this attribute purely as a technical outline representation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the faucets and fixtures proportionate and correctly positioned relative to the sink basins in both the top-down and angled side views without any distortions?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows faucets and fixtures positioned proportionately concerning the sink structure, using explicit and clear lines to suggest accurate placement. In Image A, faucets are aligned properly with sink basins. The technical drawing (Image B) maintains this placement without distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the layout of the top-down view and angled side view logically arranged and spaced to facilitate easy interpretation of the sink structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B offers a clear, structured representation of the sink in both views, aiding easy interpretation through precise technical depiction. In Image A, the actual bathroom layout is consistent, with elements positioned for functional use. Image B maintains logical arrangement, aiding understanding despite differences in representation style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
