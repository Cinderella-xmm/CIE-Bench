      "question": "Is the white studio background uniformly flat and free of shadows, texture mismatches, or visible edges where it meets the toy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white studio background appears smooth and consistent, providing a clear and unobtrusive setting for the toy. There are no visible shadows or texture mismatches around the toy's edges, indicating a seamless integration. This observation relies on the visual cues of uniform color and the absence of distracting elements, ensuring the main focus remains on the toy.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular patch on the hippo's side shows a consistent knit texture matching the rest of the hippo’s fabric. The thickness is uniform, and there is no raised or detached appearance, which suggests cohesive design and proper application within the toy’s overall structure.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plastic window in Image B is indeed transparent, allowing clear visibility of the toy behind it. There are subtle reflections that enhance the realism without distorting the appearance of the toy, indicating proper rendering of the transparency effect.",
