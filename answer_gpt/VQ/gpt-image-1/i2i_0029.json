      "question": "Do the extended stripes seamlessly blend into the grass without creating unnatural textures or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes extend from the zebra's body onto the ground, creating an intricate pattern that transitions from the zebra's natural stripes to a surreal design that covers the ground. By analyzing this transition, it's evident that the extended stripes do not blend seamlessly into the grass but rather form a distinct and unnatural pattern that contrasts sharply with what would be expected in nature. These extensions create an optical illusion and thus disrupt the typical visual texture of grass.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stripes extended in a way that preserves the original geometric structure and proportions of the zebra's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surreal extension of stripes takes the natural geometric pattern of the zebra and extends it in a way that significantly alters the proportions and directions of the stripes, creating a mesmerizing, continuous pattern that flows into the background. This indicates that while the original stripe design is echoed, the extended pattern does not maintain the geometric structure and proportions inherent to the zebra's natural body shape, which is more rigidly structured in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a visually credible composition where the zebra remains the focal point without being overshadowed by the surreal extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is set against a backdrop of extended stripes that create a hypnotic pattern. Despite the complexity and boldness of these extended stripes, the zebra remains the focal point largely due to its distinct natural form and clear visibility against the patterned background. The zebra draws immediate attention due to its contrast with the environment, maintaining its role as the central subject of the composition. The surreal extensions serve to enhance rather than overshadow the zebra.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are key features of the zebra such as its mane, ears, and legs still clearly visible and natural looking amidst the surreal extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the surreal extension of stripes into the background, the zebra's mane, ears, and legs remain visibly distinct. These features are clearly delineated from the surrounding patterned environment, maintaining their natural form and visibility while harmonizing with the extended stripe design. This demonstrates a balance between maintaining the zebraâ€™s features and integrating into an artistic composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the zebra's stripes and the grass been preserved without noticeable degradation or introduction of artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the stripes have been transformed into an artistic pattern that covers both the zebra and the surrounding environment. While this transformation introduces a surreal element, the preservation of fine details is focused on the stripe pattern itself rather than the naturalistic depiction of grass. Consequently, the grass is replaced with an artistic pattern that does not exhibit the original texture, indicating a shift rather than preservation of fine details from Image A.",
