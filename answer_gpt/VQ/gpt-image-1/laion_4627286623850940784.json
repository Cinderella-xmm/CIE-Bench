      "question": "Is the seed packet in the gnome’s left hand proportionally sized and properly aligned with the hand, showing no signs of floating or unnatural attachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seed packet in the gnome's left hand appears to be proportionally sized and aligned with the gnome's hand. The edges of the packet connect seamlessly with the hand, indicating no signs of floating or unnatural attachment. This suggests that the packet is realistically integrated into the image.",

      "question": "Are the faux soil and botanical illustrations at the base of the gnome seamlessly integrated, showing natural texture and proper alignment with the ground plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soil and botanical illustrations are integrated into the scene with a consistent style. The botanical elements rise from the base, and the texture appears uniform across the faux soil and plants. Their alignment with the ground plane seems accurate, creating a natural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the seed bombs in both hands have a natural spherical shape with appropriate surface texture and fit securely within the gnome’s hands without distorting finger positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seed bombs in Image B are depicted with a spherical shape and surface texture consistent with earthy materials. They fit naturally within both of the gnome's hands, without causing distortion or unnatural positions in the fingers, indicating proper integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the earthy textures applied to the seed packet, seed bombs, soil, and illustrations consistent in style and free from visible artifacts such as pixelation or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textures throughout Image B on the seed packet, seed bombs, soil, and surrounding illustrations maintain a consistent earthy style, with no visible artifacts like pixelation or unnatural shading. This results in a coherent texture application across the image elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the edited image balanced and structured like a product package, with all elements arranged in a logical and non-cluttered manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is designed in the style of a product package, with the elements neatly organized. The gnome, seed packets, and text are logically placed to maintain clarity, and the use of space allows each component to stand out without clutter. This reflects a balanced and structured composition as seen in commercial packaging designs.",
