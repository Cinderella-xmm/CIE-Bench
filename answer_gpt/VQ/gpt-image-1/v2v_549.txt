    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi-style Funko Pop figure maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the baseball player's pose and attire without introducing unnatural distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure adheres to the classic characteristics of such figurines, which include exaggerated head size and simplified body proportions. While this is not realistic, it is intentional and consistent with the stylized design typical of Funko Pop products. Therefore, although the proportions differ from those of a real person, they align with the expected design of a chibi-style figure, maintaining intended consistency.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the detailed textures and lighting of the realistic depiction of the figure outside the box natural and consistent with the lighting and textures in the original image?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a Funko Pop figure which, by design, lacks the realism of a human due to its smooth surfaces and stylized form. The texture, being plastic-like, is consistent with other Funko Pop figurines rather than realistic human textures. The lighting appears even across the figure, consistent with typical studio product photography rather than with complex, varied real-world lighting like Image A, but it suits the context of the product depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

There is no blend into a realistic style as the figure remains constantly faithful to its playful and smooth design language typical to Funko Pops, ensuring there is no loss of consistency or accuracy.",
