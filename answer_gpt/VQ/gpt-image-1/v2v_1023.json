      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D characters retain natural proportions and avoid unnatural distortions in their facial features and body shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style 3D characters have exaggerated proportions characteristic of chibi art, such as larger heads and smaller bodies, but they are consistent with the chibi aesthetic. There are no visible distortions beyond the intentional artistic style, meaning they maintain coherence within this aesthetic. This is a known style where proportions are intentionally altered for a cute and simplified appearance, which is considered 'natural' in chibi art.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature snowflakes and twinkling lights inside the snow globe in Image B are consistent with typical features seen in such objects.

      "explanation": "In Image B, the game controllers are modeled in a simplified style to match the chibi characters, but they retain the essential features and shapes that indicate they are game controllers. The simplified textures and forms are typical of the chibi aesthetic, and nothing about them appears non-functional or unnatural within this stylized context.",
