      "question": "Do the rider's eyes appear naturally oversized and expressive without any unnatural texture or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rider is depicted in a chibi style, which typically features exaggerated facial features, such as large expressive eyes. This is a stylistic choice common in chibi or anime art that emphasizes cuteness. The eyes in Image B appear appropriately oversized with no apparent issues such as texture or distortion that deviate from this art style norm. Therefore, the rider's eyes are consistent with the expected chibi characteristics.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style depiction of the rider's beige shirt maintain its structural consistency and material appearance without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi style of Image B, even though the shirt is simplified to match the typical chibi aesthetic, it retains consistency in its representation. The shirt appears as a simple design, with clear outlines and no apparent artifacts that would otherwise break the visual harmony of the simplified style. The material and structural components are appropriately suggested with minimal detail, fitting the chibi context.",

      "question": "Is the chibi-style representation of the horse proportionally correct and physically rational, avoiding any distortion or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is rendered in a chibi style, which naturally involves some exaggeration or simplification. However, the horse retains proportional integrity typical of chibi illustrations, where features are emphasized or stylized but still recognizable as a horse. The proportions, while adjusted for stylization, do not display any distortions or unnatural shapes beyond what is expected in such an artistic approach.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a background featuring warm tones and minimalistic decorations, such as stars or confetti, in line with the chibi style, which often includes whimsical and playful elements.

The background serves to enhance the chibi visual experience, maintaining coherency with the overall scene.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rider's hairstyle in the chibi style remains consistent with their overall depiction, offering a simplified but recognizable version of a short hairstyle.
