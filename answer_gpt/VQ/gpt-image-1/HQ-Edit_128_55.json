      "question": "Do the feathered wing extensions on the sides of the door maintain consistent wood grain and carving depth, with smooth transitions from the original panel edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feathered wing extensions are intricately carved, showing a detailed wood grain pattern that complements the design of the owl. The transition from the original panel edges to the wings is smooth, with carving depth and detail consistent with the rest of the wooden structure. This suggests deliberate, skilled craftsmanship where the extensions are integrated without jarring breaks, aligning with the visual continuity seen throughout the piece.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the shimmering eyes formed from the iron studs aligned with their original positions and embedded within the wood without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's shimmering eyes are visually distinct and do not directly correspond to the door's original iron studs. The eyes are embedded in a manner consistent with the owl's face, indicating attention to alignment within the carved owl structure itself, rather than maintaining the positions of studs from Image A. There are no signs of floating or incorrect overlapping; the eyes are integrated correctly into the owl’s design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the celestial crown emerging from the arch maintain continuous curvature and seamless integration with the original arch shape, without broken lines or floating pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the celestial crown features a design that extends smoothly from the arch shape, with consistent curvature connecting logically with the archway. There are no broken lines or floating pieces, which ensures that the integrity and continuity of the original arch structure are preserved. The careful integration of new motifs reflects a seamless transition and design incorporation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the etched runes visible across the door’s surface consistent in depth, color, and lighting with the original carvings, and do they not cover or distort existing patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows rune-like carvings on the owl's surface, integrated consistently with depth, color, and lighting matching the surrounding patterns and carvings. They do not overlay or distort existing decorative elements but instead complement the ornately carved wooden structure. This suggests careful modification to maintain balance and harmony with the original textures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cloak-like structure around the doorframe exhibit natural fabric folds with consistent lighting and shadow, and does it maintain connection to the original stone frame without gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a cloak-like fabric, there is an architectural structure that resembles wings wrapping around the owl design. The image does not represent fabric folds, lighting, or shadow typical of textiles but shows detailed wood carvings that integrate with the surrounding stone and arch structures without gaps or distortions, ensuring a cohesive appearance within the overall design.",
