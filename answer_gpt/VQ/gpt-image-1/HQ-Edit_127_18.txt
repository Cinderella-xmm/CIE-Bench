    "Question": "Q1: Are the boundaries of the vintage travel case visible and seamlessly integrated into the scene without sudden shifts in perspective or lighting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boundaries of the vintage travel case are clearly visible and smoothly integrated into the scene. The transition from the interior elements to the case structure maintains a consistent perspective and lighting, without abrupt changes that could disrupt the visual continuity. The corners of the case are rounded, matching the consistent lighting with smooth transitions that blend the case into the diorama setup naturally, indicating careful attention to detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the textured resin grass show individual blades with natural variation in length and angle, and does it cast soft shadows consistent with the light source?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the resin grass is depicted with individual blades that exhibit variation in both length and angle, creating a natural appearance reminiscent of real grass. The shadows cast by these blades are soft, aligning well with the direction and quality of the primary light source in the scene. This consistency in texture, variation, and shadow softness suggests a realistic portrayal of grass, contributing to the overall believability of the diorama.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the miniature acacia tree significantly smaller than the elephant and placed at a distance that creates a believable sense of scale within the diorama?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature acacia tree is depicted as much smaller in size compared to the elephant, which matches the typical relative sizes of these elements when viewed from a distance in real life. This size differentiation helps establish a sense of scale that aligns with the diorama's intended miniature setup. The placement and scaling work together to maintain the illusion of depth and proportion in the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the painted clouds located on the inner surface of the lid, showing no specular highlights or depth inconsistencies that would suggest they are floating?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds appear as part of a painted backdrop on the inner surface of the case lid. The absence of specular highlights or variations in depth ensures they look two-dimensional and stationary, rather than floating or casting shadows. This presentation supports the intended flat depiction, maintaining consistency with a painted background attribute.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the brass compass resting flat on the base with a clear reflection and shadow that matches the lighting direction and surface texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brass compass is shown resting flat on the base of the diorama. The reflection and shadow from the compass are clear and consistent with the overall lighting direction and surface texture in the image. This attention to detail suggests a realistic interaction with light, consistent with the position and orientation of the compass within the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the elephant retain natural skin texture, correct limb proportions, and intact tusk curvature without any visible deformation or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant displays natural skin texture with visible details that mimic real elephant skin. Its limb proportions are correct, aligning with realistic anatomy, while the tusks maintain their natural slightly curved shape, without deformation or pixelation. These accurate representations help ensure the figurine remains convincing and lifelike within the diorama context.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do all objects in the diorama cast shadows in the same direction and with similar softness, consistent with a single light source from above?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast by the different objects in the diorama, including the elephant, acacia tree, and compass, all align in the same direction with similar softness. This consistency indicates the presence of a single dominant light source situated above the scene, ensuring harmonious lighting throughout the diorama that supports visual unity and realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
