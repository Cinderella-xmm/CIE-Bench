      "question": "Does the addition of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\" introduce any unnatural textures or visibly distorted areas on the cat's fur, whiskers, or eyes?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is superimposed over areas surrounding the cat but does not overlap with the cat's fur, whiskers, or eyes. The areas of the cat depicted in the image remain clear and free from unnatural textures or distortions, suggesting that the text was added without affecting those specific parts of the cat.",

      "question": "Does the placement of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\" maintain structural consistency and avoid disrupting the proportions and physical rationality of the cat's face and body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text is strategically placed at the top and bottom of the image, framing the cat without covering or altering the proportions of the cat's body. The placement maintains harmony with the image's composition and does not distort the structure or appearance of the cat.",

      "question": "Has the natural appearance and authenticity of the cat's expression, fur pattern, and posture been preserved despite the addition of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\"?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the addition of text does not interfere with or cover the main features of the cat, such as its expression, fur pattern, or posture. The text is positioned in areas around these features, ensuring they remain natural and authentic in appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, retains clarity and fine details in the cat's features, such as the fur strands, whiskers, and paw pads. These details remain sharp, indicating that the editing process did not introduce any blurring or pixelation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the integration of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\" into the image avoid logical inconsistencies such as overlapping unnaturally with the cat's fur or appearing embedded in a way that defies common sense?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is placed in a manner that does not overlap with or disrupt the visual continuity of the cat's fur. It appears as an overlay that respects the natural boundaries of the visible areas of the cat, thus avoiding any logical inconsistencies.",
