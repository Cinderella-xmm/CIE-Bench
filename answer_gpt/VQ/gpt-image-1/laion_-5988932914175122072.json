      "question": "Does the surface of the model’s dress retain the same pebbled leather texture as the original handbag, with no visible smoothing, blurring, or texture repetition artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress is designed to mimic the texture of the pebbled leather seen in Image A's handbag. By analyzing the dress, it retains the distinct pebbled leather surface texture consistent with the handbag's material. No visible smoothing or texture artifacts are evident, suggesting a successful transfer of texture. This is concluded through direct observation of uniform texture across the dress.",
