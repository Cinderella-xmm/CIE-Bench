      "question": "Does the line-art representation of the elderly man maintain accurate proportions and natural joint alignment in his tai chi stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the line-art depiction seems to be proportionate with respect to human anatomy, as the stance reflects a well-balanced tai chi posture. The extended arm and the knee up gesture appear to follow the natural curvature and alignment typical of such a martial arts position. This aligns with common knowledge of anatomically accurate art representations.",

      "question": "Are the pastel watercolor tones applied uniformly across the scene, preserving smooth gradients and avoiding harsh edges or inconsistent color zones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of pastel watercolor tones appears consistent as there is a smooth gradient transition from the foreground to the background. This is a typical technique to maintain harmony in art illustrations. There are no visible harsh edges or abrupt changes in color zones.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossom patterns integrated naturally into the background, maintaining depth and perspective consistency with the existing trees and mist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossom patterns are softly incorporated into the background, matching the ethereal quality of the mist and contributing to the overall depth of the scene. The perspective is consistent with this type of composition, resembling images where blossoms enhance visual depth.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the date grids placed in a way that respects the spatial boundaries of the scene, such as being anchored to the ground or wall without overlapping the man’s body or distorting his silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible date grids within the given scene. The only text present is 'APRIL', which is placed beneath the feet of the man, respecting the composition’s spatial boundaries without interfering with or overlapping his silhouette.",

      "question": "Does the hand forming the \"OK\" gesture have exactly five fingers, with natural joint curvature and no elongated, missing, or duplicated digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the line-art depiction of the hand with an 'OK' gesture appears anatomically correct with five distinct fingers, showing a natural curvature typical of such a gesture, without any visible anomalies like missing or duplicated digits.",
