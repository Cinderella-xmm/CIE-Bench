      "question": "Are the golden batik patterns on the dancer's dress clearly defined, continuous, and free from pixelation or jagged edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the dancer's dress with golden batik patterns. To determine if these patterns are free from pixelation or jagged edges, one must analyze the visual clarity, continuity, and smoothness of the lines and curves in these patterns. In digital art, such jagged edges often suggest lower resolution or digital artifacts. The patterns appear well-defined with smooth and continuous curves, and there is no visible pixelation or jagged edges.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the line-drawn version of the temple maintain accurate tier alignment and structural symmetry without missing or distorted roof layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The line-drawn version of the temple in the edited image should be analyzed for proper tier alignment and structural symmetry. Accurate drawing requires a clear depiction of all tiers being evenly stacked and symmetrical around the central axis. The line-drawn version reflects these characteristics, showing each roof layer correctly with uniform tiers and symmetry, matching expectations of architectural accuracy.",

      "question": "Are the two guardian statues on either side of the pathway identical in size, pose, and position relative to the central temple axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the guardian statues should be visually analyzed for symmetry and identical features. This analysis involves observing size, pose, and positioning relative to the temple axis. Despite line drawing simplification, the statues maintain identical poses, and their position is symmetrically aligned, indicating size and placement consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do both of the dancer’s hands show five fingers each with natural spacing, smooth contours, and no deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts the dancer's hands, which must be inspected for anatomical accuracy. The hands show five fingers, each with natural spacing and smooth contours. There is no deformation or presence of extra digits, ensuring a realistic depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text positioned in a way that does not overlap or obscure the dancer, temple, or guardian statues, and is it clearly readable without visual clutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the placement of text should be assessed for its unobtrusiveness and clarity. Proper text placement ensures it doesn’t overlap or obscure key visual elements like the dancer, temple, and guardian statues. The text is neatly placed alongside these elements without causing clutter, ensuring readability.",
