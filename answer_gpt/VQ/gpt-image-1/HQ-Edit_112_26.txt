    "Question": "Q3: Is the chibi cat figure positioned correctly within the box, with its body fully contained and aligned with the interior space?",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the fur texture of the realistic cat figure beside the box show consistent flow and detail comparable to the original cat’s fur?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays a chibi-style cat rather than a realistic one. The fur texture on this type of figure typically lacks the intricate detail found in the realistic portrayal given in Image A. Therefore, it does not maintain the realistic consistency or detail shown in Image A’s realistic cat figure due to the figurine's stylized and simplified nature.",
    "answer": "No"
