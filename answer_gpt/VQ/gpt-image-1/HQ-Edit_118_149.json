    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the pastel-colored areas of the dancer's leotard and tights smoothly blended without visible color artifacts or unnatural transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastel colors on the dancer's leotard and tights display a smooth and consistent color distribution, which is typical for a well-executed graphic edit. Pastel colors are generally soft and should not exhibit sharp transitions or artifacts, and the image conveys this with even coloring.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the detachable sections around the dancer’s leg maintain consistent thickness and alignment with the leg’s natural curvature, avoiding floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges around the dancer’s leg on the sticker appear consistent and follow the natural curve. The detachable sections align with the expected contours of a dancer’s posture, showing no signs of floating or misalignment, which is crucial for maintaining the realism of the sticker.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the angular transformations applied to the dancer’s limbs physically plausible, with joints and limbs maintaining correct anatomical relationships and no exaggerated bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animator-style drawing or sticker maintains realistic anatomical proportions for a dancer performing a ballet pose. The limb joints and limbs themselves are rendered in a manner consistent with what is expected anatomically for a highly flexible ballet dancer.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the dancer’s sticker figures cleanly integrated onto the journal surface, with shadows and lighting matching the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sticker figures demonstrate clean integration onto the journal surface. The edges are precise, and the lighting and shadows are coherent with the light source direction as expected in a two-dimensional representation style reflecting the surrounding environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dancer’s hands retain five fingers each, with natural spacing and proportions, and no fused or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the graphic representation of the hands, it's apparent that the hand rendering does not focus on detailed finger representation due to the simplified artistic style; however, the positions and approximate digit proportions are implied correctly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
