    "Question": "Q1: Has the removal of the second zebra and grassland resulted in a clean transition without visible artifacts or unnatural edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the area originally occupied by the second zebra and grassland now features a consistent green gradient backdrop. The analysis involves checking for any irregularities such as outlines or mismatched areas where the zebra or grassland used to be. The transition appears smooth and coherent, with no visible artifacts or unnatural edges left behind.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the green gradient plane replacing the grass blend seamlessly with the zebra and ground, maintaining natural gradients and avoiding sharp contrasts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the replacement of the grass with a green gradient should not create any harsh lines or abrupt changes in the image's color palette. The gradient smoothly moves from green to an earth tone at the bottom, matching the ground and complementing the zebra. The transition is smooth, preserving a natural-looking progression without sharp contrasts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the zebra on the left intact and proportionally correct, with no signs of distortion or unnatural texture?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a zebra that needs to appear normal in terms of proportions and texture. Upon analyzing the zebra, it maintains natural proportions with no signs of distortion in limbs or body shape. The texture of its fur and stripes appears consistent and realistic, supporting an undistorted representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the details of the zebra's stripes and the ground's texture well-preserved, ensuring high-quality representation without loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a close examination of the zebra's stripes and the ground's texture is necessary to determine whether detail and quality have been maintained. The zebra's stripes are sharp and clear, and the ground retains its sandy texture without signs of blurring or loss of detail, exemplifying high-quality preservation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the final composition effectively convey a calm and solitary atmosphere without any elements disrupting the visual harmony?",
    "explanation": "For Image B's composition to convey calmness and solitude, the arrangement and color choices should complement simplicity. The single zebra against the gradient backdrop, devoid of additional elements or clutter, achieves visual harmony and evokes a peaceful and solitary mood.",
    "answer": "Yes"
