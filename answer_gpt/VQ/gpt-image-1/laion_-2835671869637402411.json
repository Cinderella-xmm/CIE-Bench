        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the proportion of the limbs and head of the character in the edited image, the arms appear realistic for a seated pose, with the sleeves gently following the contours of the arms, suggesting correctly proportioned limbs. The head maintains a typical proportion relative to the body, consistent with a traditional painting style. There are no visible symptoms of stiffness or distortion in the limbs and head.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lace dress in the edited image shows clear definition in its layers, with naturally rendered folds and shadows. The interaction with light enhances the lace texture, creating believable volume and depth. The lace edges and overlapping sections demonstrate realistic light and shadow play.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden sewing kit in the edited image displays a discernible wood texture, providing a realistic feel. The internal components and shadows are consistent with a natural light source in the environment, aligning logically with the lamp's illumination, suggesting proper integration with the scene.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The oil lamp in the edited image shows clear glass and metal components, lending to a realistic structural design. The lamp's light disperses softly, producing realistic shadows and facilitating natural illumination on surrounding objects, seamlessly fitting into the scene.",
