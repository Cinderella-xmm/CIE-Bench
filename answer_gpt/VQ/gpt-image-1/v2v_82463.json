      "question": "Do the textures of the bronze sculpture accurately represent the casual clothing and relaxed poses of the individuals without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bronze sculpture effectively captures the texture of casual clothing, such as the knit pattern on the tank top and the creases on the shorts. The poses of the individuals are relaxed, with one person sitting and the other standing next to the vehicle, which is common in casual and leisurely settings. The material does a good job of representing these elements without introducing unnatural artifacts, as the details of the clothing and the casual way the individuals are posed are consistent and smooth.",

      "question": "Does the bronze sculpture of the white SUV maintain its original structure and proportions without any visible geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bronze SUV retains the structural details and proportions similar to typical vehicles of this type. The headlights, grille, and overall body shape appear to be consistent with what you would expect in an SUV, without visible warps or distortions. The bronze material moulds smoothly over these surfaces, maintaining the integrity of the vehicleâ€™s shape and form against the original scene's geometry.",

      "question": "Are the gentle waves and sandy beach depicted in the bronze diorama with natural undulations and without any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the waves and sandy beach convincingly in bronze. The waves have distinct yet gentle undulations that mimic the natural movement of water, and the sand has a smooth, slightly uneven surface consistent with natural terrain. The use of bronze does not introduce unfamiliar textures; instead, it manages to portray these elements realistically by adding a subtle layered effect to demonstrate the movement of waves and the texture of sand.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the hands and facial expressions of the individuals in the bronze diorama retain natural shapes and details without any loss or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the bronze sculpture (Image B), the hands of the individuals appear well-defined, with distinct finger shapes that maintain natural proportions. Although facial expressions in bronze are harder to discern without fine details like those in a real photograph, the overall shapes of the faces and positioning of the heads suggest an accurate portrayal of the original intentions. Given the limitations of bronze, which does not convey subtle details like skin texture or expression nuances, the sculpture still retains natural and proportionate shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition of the bronze diorama, including the placement of the individuals and the vehicle, match the original scene without any inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in the bronze diorama in Image B mirrors the general layout of Image A. The person standing is positioned next to the SUV, and the individual sitting on the vehicle remains in the same relative position to the scene. The placement replicates the original scene accurately, with no visible inconsistencies between the two images in terms of how the elements are arranged spatially.",
