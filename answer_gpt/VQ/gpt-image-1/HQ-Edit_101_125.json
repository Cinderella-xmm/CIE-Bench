      "question": "Do both hands of the elderly gentleman have exactly five fingers each, with natural spacing and joint alignment consistent with human anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly gentleman's hands are drawn in a simplified and cartoonish style. This makes it difficult to see clear details about the number of fingers or their natural spacing and joint alignment due to the stylized nature. Simplification often involves depicting hands with fewer details, and hands might not show each individual finger distinctly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the size of the newspaper proportionate to the man’s body such that it rests naturally on his lap and is fully supported by his hands without appearing to float or exceed physical plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the newspaper appears to be the right size relative to the cartoon figure, resting naturally on his lap and seems to be supported by his hands, as per typical cartoon proportions. This maintains a level of plausibility common in illustrated or animated contexts, where objects maintain consistent but simplified proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the thought bubble placed adjacent to the man’s head without overlapping any part of his face or hair, and does it have a smooth, closed outline without jagged or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thought bubble is positioned next to where the man's head would be, maintaining a clear space without overlapping the hair or facial area. It has a smooth, closed outline, which is typical in cartoon illustrations, ensuring clarity and legibility.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees and foliage are illustrated in a cartoon style. The tree trunks and foliage are rendered consistently without warped geometry or broken shapes, adhering to the uniform and stylized cartoon style that emphasizes simplicity and clarity.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the textured cardstock effect visible across the entire image without distorting fine details like facial lines, clothing seams, or newspaper content, and are the pastel colors evenly distributed without causing color bleed or shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a textured cardstock effect that is uniform across the image, supporting the pastel colors used in the illustration. This style does not distort details like facial lines or clothing seams, nor does it cause color bleed or excessive shadowing. The colors are evenly distributed to maintain clarity and visual appeal in the simplified illustration.",
