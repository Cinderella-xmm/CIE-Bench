    "Question": "Q1: Are the iridescent wings attached to the spider’s thorax symmetrically and do they display smooth, continuous mosaic-like patterns without jagged edges or texture breaks?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, we observe that the spider has a pair of wings attached to its thorax. These wings have an iridescent, mosaic-like pattern that appears smooth and continuous without any broken textures or jagged edges. The symmetry of attachment is evident as both wings are equally positioned on either side of the thorax, indicative of a natural balance. This is realized by observing the evenly spaced and aligned wings, typical of creatures with symmetrical features.",
