      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the surface of the painted figure show consistent brushstroke patterns and subtle texture variations typical of oil paint on wood, without blocky or repetitive digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background and other visible parts of the painting exhibit a swirling pattern reminiscent of Van Goghâ€™s style, known for its thick brushstrokes and textured appearance. The style is consistent throughout, without obvious blocky, repetitive patterns indicative of digital artifacts. The texture variation appears intentional, typical of oil paintings on wood.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beard and mustache flow naturally in spirals and curves that resemble individual strands of hair. They avoid forming any unnatural loops or patterns associated with fluid-like surfaces, maintaining a fiber-like structure consistent with a stylized representation of hair.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cloak in Image B is depicted with a smooth texture, capturing the reflective qualities expected of velvet.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat sits naturally atop the head, maintaining a proper shape that complements the skull. The peacock feathers are artistically embedded along the brim, showing a natural curvature and orientation without clipping into the facial region, contributing to the harmonious composition.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is well-defined against the vibrant background. The edges are clean, free from haloing or double outlines, ensuring the character appears seamlessly set within the scene. There is no indication of poor compositing like partial transparency.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
