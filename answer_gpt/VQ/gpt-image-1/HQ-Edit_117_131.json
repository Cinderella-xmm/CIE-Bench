      "question": "Does the pastel purple fur with teal accents maintain natural fur texture and gradient transitions across the body, particularly on the tail and back, without visible color blocking or artificial smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel has a cartoonish design with a pastel purple fur and teal accents. The coloring is consistent with a stylized illustration, emphasizing smooth transitions typical of graphic design rather than realistic fur texture. In such illustrations, the focus is on artistic expression rather than natural gradients or texture. Therefore, the appearance cannot be judged by realistic standards. Instead, it should be assessed for consistency within its style. The colors maintain this smooth gradient within the cartoon context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the backpack positioned correctly on the squirrel’s back without deforming its posture or causing unnatural bulges in the fur, and does it display consistent material texture and shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack is positioned on the cartoon squirrel's back, appropriately sized and aligned with the character's body. Given the stylized nature of the image, the backpack does not cause unnatural bulges, as there is no realistic fur to distort. The material texture is simplified but consistent with the cartoon's aesthetic, showing basic shading for dimensionality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glasses positioned symmetrically over the squirrel’s eyes with proper reflection details and soft shadows, and do they not distort the eye area or appear disproportionately large?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glasses fit well over the squirrel's eyes, symmetrical to the face and not distorting the eye area. The proportions are exaggerated to fit the cartoon style but remain balanced within that context. Reflection details and shadows in cartoons are often minimal; however, the illustration maintains coherence in style.",

      "question": "Is the integration of the squirrel into the new forest background seamless, with no visible edge artifacts, mismatched lighting, or floating elements around the feet and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The squirrel in Image B is seamlessly integrated into the illustrated forest background. The edges are clean, and the lighting is consistent across the scene, reflecting the harmonious style common in such illustrations. There are no visible artifacts or floating elements around the feet and tail; the character blends naturally with the background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cartoonish flowers and mushrooms positioned at plausible distances from the squirrel, showing correct occlusion and depth cues, and do they have consistent textures and shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers and mushrooms are placed around the squirrel in a way that suggests depth and perspective, fitting the style of the cartoon illustration. The occlusion and simplification match the expected aesthetic, providing a believable spatial arrangement and consistent cartoonish texture and shading.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the title banner positioned above the squirrel at a reasonable height, with legible text and soft shadows that match the scene’s lighting, without overlapping key elements like the squirrel’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title banner in Image B is positioned above the squirrel in a balanced manner, allowing the text to be clearly legible without interfering with the character’s head. Soft shadows complement the cartoon style, maintaining the overall aesthetic. There is no overlap with key elements, ensuring clarity and readability.",
