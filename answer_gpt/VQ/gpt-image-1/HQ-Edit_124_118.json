      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the waterfall in the center of the image appear as a coherent, transparent projection with smooth flow lines and consistent light interaction, without visible pixelation or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfall appears to be a digital projection with a futuristic design theme. The flow lines of the waterfall are smooth and the interaction of light is consistent, showcasing a holographic or neon-like appearance typical of digital art. This suggests that there is no visible pixelation or broken geometric shapes, keeping in line with common standards for polished digital imagery. Image A presents a realistic waterfall amidst a natural jungle setting which differs in style but does not influence the digital coherence of Image B's waterfall.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree trunks and vines in the foreground displaying iridescent fiber-optic-like strands that follow natural branch contours without breaking geometric continuity or exhibiting patchy, non-uniform glow patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trunks and vines are rendered to mimic a neon or fiber-optic effect, following a coherent and fluid form. This technique in digital art creates contours that seem to flow naturally, often enhancing with iridescent, uniform glow patterns typical in such digital displays. It suggests there are no breaks or inconsistences. Image A uses natural contours for the trees and vines, which provides a contrast in style but does not impact the consistency in the edited image's rendering.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vine formations in the foreground and along the riverbanks form continuous, self-supporting loops without floating disconnected segments or geometrically impossible bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B’s vine formations appear to be digital constructs, potentially hosting loops infused with digital artistry intended to emulate a sci-fi or futuristic aesthetic. These loops maintain geometric continuity without any disconnected parts or physically implausible bends, adhering to logical consistency in the presentation. Image A does feature naturalistic vines, again presenting a different artistic approach, yet not affecting the integrity of how Image B's vine structures are designed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background landscape (distant mountains and sky) visually consistent with the foreground projections, showing no abrupt transitions, mismatched lighting, or unnatural fog effects that suggest poor layer blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background landscape appears digitally rendered with attention to maintaining cohesion with the foreground. The lighting and blending with the neon-themed elements are consistent, ensuring a uniform visual effect without abrupt light transitions or blending issues. Image A presents a natural landscape, differing in style but not influencing the digital transition and blending quality in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the river stones, foliage, and moss-covered surfaces in the lower portion of the image sharp and detailed, without blurred edges or repeating pattern artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a digital representation where textures like river stones and foliage are rendered with a focus on neon luminosity rather than sharp real-world textures seen in Image A. While Image A shows sharp natural textures, Image B’s focus on the digital effect means the sharp detail and presence of repeating pattern artifacts aren't prominent due to the artistic technique prioritizing light effects over textural detail.",
