    "Question": "Q1: Does the enhanced chandelier retain its symmetrical structure and realistic crystal texture, with no visible distortion or irregularities in its shape or lighting reflections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chandelier is depicted with a symmetrical structure, as the armature design radiates evenly around its axis. The graphical representation of the chandelier maintains a consistent-sized and proportionate hanging design similar to that of traditional crystal chandeliers. The texture mimics realism through shading that suggests crystal facets and reflections. These visual cues aid in perceiving a coherently symmetrical and undistorted form, essential for maintaining the chandelier's aesthetic appeal and structural integrity.",
