    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the luminescent ferns in the canopy have consistent, organic shapes and smooth gradients that resemble real plant growth patterns without pixelation or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminescent ferns in the canopy of Image B exhibit smooth gradients and organic shapes, reminiscent of natural plant growth patterns. The gradients flow seamlessly without pixelation or jagged edges, indicating a realistic and artistic execution.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the silver tribal patterns on the bark aligned with the natural contours of the trunk and free from floating, misaligned, or unnaturally sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silver tribal patterns on the bark adhere closely to the trunk's natural contours. They are integrated smoothly without signs of floating, misalignment, or sharp edges that would disrupt the natural flow and appearance. These patterns enhance the trunk's visual appeal while maintaining realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the translucent wings extending from the canopy smoothly connected to the treeâ€™s branches, showing gradual transparency and consistent layering without visible seams or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays translucent wings with consistent layering and gradual transparency, smoothly connected to the tree's branches. The wings exhibit no visible seams or geometric distortions, enhancing the tree's ethereal quality and artistry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the glass-like fibers forming the trunk exhibit realistic light refraction, consistent thickness variation, and continuous flow without abrupt breaks or unnatural twists?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's glass-like fibers forming the trunk demonstrate realistic light refraction, and their flow is continuous with consistent thickness variation. There are no abrupt breaks or unnatural twists, creating a harmonious and visually appealing structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing tendrils extend from the tree base into the ground with smooth curvature and consistent luminosity, without intersecting the grass unnaturally or showing flat, non-continuous surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing tendrils in Image B extend from the tree base with smooth curvature and consistent luminosity. They merge into the ground naturally without intersecting the grass in an awkward manner or showcasing flat, non-continuous surfaces, achieving a well-integrated look.",
