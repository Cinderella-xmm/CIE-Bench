    "Question": "Q1: Does the key maintain its original geometric shape and proportions when transformed into a bridge, without any visible warping or stretching?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the key is creatively transformed into a bridge that spans over a resin river and tiny houses. Despite its new functionality, the key’s shape and proportions appear unchanged, as the bit of the key fits smoothly over the flowing river without visible distortion. This suggests that the key retains its original form without warping or stretching when used as a bridge, representing a clever integration of its geometric structure into the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the tiny houses and trees positioned in a way that aligns with the wood grain’s depth and surface plane, without floating or appearing disconnected from the background?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the tiny houses and trees are crafted to appear securely nestled into the carved landscape, complementing the curvature of the hill. This integration demonstrates careful placement that aligns with the wood grain’s depth, presenting a convincing connectedness to the background. The houses and trees do not float or seem misplaced, enhancing the natural feel of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the resin river emerge smoothly from the key’s bit and flow with consistent material properties, showing no sharp breaks or unnatural color shifts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the resin river flows smoothly from underneath the key’s bit. The material properties of the river are consistently portrayed, with no abrupt breaks or unnatural shifts in color. The flow of the river exhibits a coherent color gradient and texture, signifying a thoughtful and continuous design that blends harmoniously with the rest of the diorama.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the boundary of the key case clearly defined and consistent with the wood grain and metallic tones of the key, without abrupt changes in texture or lighting?",
    "explanation": "Based on Image B, the boundary of the key case forms a well-defined frame around the miniature scene. The case’s metallic tones are consistent with the key’s material, and the lighting throughout the image smoothly transitions without abrupt changes. This consistency assures a seamless presentation with the wood grain and the overall composition visible in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the carved wooden hill seamlessly blended into the surrounding wood grain, with consistent texture and shading that suggests natural carving rather than digital patching?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the carved wooden hill integrates fluidly into the scene, maintaining consistent texture and shading that mimics the authenticity of natural carving. The transition from the wooden hill to the surrounding wood grain is smooth, reinforcing the perception of a natural craftsmanship rather than digital editing. This integration contributes to the realistic and artistic appeal of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
