      "question": "Does the miniature beach and surfer figure inside the snow globe appear structurally consistent and visually credible compared to the original beach scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe features a miniature version of the beach scene with a surfer figure, resembling the posture and attire of the surfer from Image A but in chibi-style format. The transition from a realistic scene to a stylized representation is executed well, maintaining structural similarities. The edited image has achieved visual credibility through accurate proportions and thoughtful placement of the key elements from the original scene inside the globe. Thus, the transformation from real to miniature version in the snow globe appears consistent.",

      "question": "Are the hands of the chibi-style 3D surfer figure free of unnatural textures and maintain the correct number of fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure inside the snow globe is designed in chibi style, characteristically having simplified and rounded features. The hands appear smooth and appropriately stylized without unnatural textures often seen in miniatures due to exaggerated detailing. Upon examination, all fingers are correctly represented for a chibi figure. This style typically simplifies features, yet still maintains anatomical aspects like finger count accurately.",

      "question": "Does the soft golden light and sparkles scattered around the snow globe create a natural and plausible warm atmosphere without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image captures a warm ambiance by using soft golden light that echoes the sunset scene from Image A. The sparkles inside the snow globe mimic snow or sometimes sand particles, which integrates well with the concept. There are no noticeable artifacts; the light and sparkles complement the scene, reinforcing warmth and coziness, especially due to the proximity of the snow globe to a warm, glowing fireplace background.",

      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the miniature surfer figure and surfboard remain intact and undistorted within the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe showcases a chibi-style surfer figure and surfboard. Despite being miniaturized, both objects maintain their basic geometric shapesâ€”such as the cylindrical surfboard and rounded structure of the figure without any distortion. This consistency in shapes preserves the integrity and aesthetics in transition from real-world objects to chibi miniatures.",

      "question": "Is the placement of the snow globe on the wooden shelf near the fireplace visually credible and proportionally realistic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe is placed on a wooden shelf, adding to the cozy scene with the fireplace in the background. The scale and proportion of the snow globe in relation to the surrounding furniture and objects appear realistic and believable. The context supports the scene; placing a snow globe near a fireplace is a common setting for presenting warmth, thereby visually credible.",
