    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cogwheel curls integrated into the hairline without distorting the shape of the head or breaking the continuity of the scalp surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cogwheel curls are visually integrated into the hairline, following a natural pattern that aligns with the shape and contour of the head. Despite being stylized, they do not disturb the overall form of the scalp and appear to be a part of the head rather than added on awkwardly. The continuity appears maintained, as the cogwheels are spaced in a way that simulates a natural transition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic fabric folds follow the natural contours of the shoulders and chest without unnatural stretching or buckling, and are the rivets and tubes placed in physically plausible locations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic folds in Image B are arranged to mimic the natural draping of fabric over shoulders and chest, showing attention to the body's natural curves. The rivets and tubes are thoughtfully placed in areas that imitate logical positions on a garment, such as around seams and edges, contributing to a plausible appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the watch parts and gears attached to the base in a stable and symmetrical arrangement without overlapping or floating elements that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch parts and gears are symmetrically and stably attached to the base, following a pattern that appears intentional and balanced. There are no visible floating or overlapping parts, suggesting a realistic design that maintains stability and adheres to physical logic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the monocle mechanism positioned flush with the eye socket and connected to the face via visible but plausible mechanical joints, without altering the shape of the surrounding facial bones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The monocle mechanism in Image B is effectively placed to align with what would be the natural eye socket area, featuring mechanical joints that appear plausible and blend into the design without noticeably altering the facial structure. This integration supports a realistic addition to the sculpture's aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bronze and copper tones uniformly applied across all modified elements, with realistic reflections and no abrupt color boundaries or flat, non-metallic areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bronze and copper tones are consistently applied across the metallic elements, presenting an even distribution of color that enhances realism through reflective qualities. There are no visible abrupt color changes or flat areas, ensuring a cohesive metallic appearance.",
