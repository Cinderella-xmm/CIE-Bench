      "question": "Does the ornate armor on the character's torso and limbs have consistent geometric structure and natural surface textures without visible distortion or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To assess the armor's geometric structure and surface textures, we look at the design details on the character's torso and limbs in Image B. The armor is rich in intricate patterns and embellishments, demonstrating a symmetrical design that is characteristic of historical armor. The visual cues indicate that the textures are natural and consistent, aligning smoothly with the character's form. There is no visible distortion, suggesting a well-executed design. Therefore, the armor appears consistent and undistorted.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the gem-studded scepter proportionally accurate and physically plausible in size and shape relative to the character’s hand, with no distorted or misaligned gemstones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the scepter held by the character in Image B, it appears proportionate relative to the character’s hand and body size. The gemstones are properly aligned along the scepter, maintaining symmetry and texture continuity, which suggests a plausible and realistic depiction. The visual cues do not show any distortion or misalignment, indicating that the scepter's design is physically plausible and accurate.",

      "question": "Does the velvet cape exhibit natural draping behavior with realistic folds and shadows, and does it avoid unnatural intersections or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The velvet cape in Image B follows the contours of the character's body, displaying realistic folds and the effect of gravity, which creates natural draping behavior. Shadows fall naturally along the folds, enhancing the depth and realism of the material. There are no signs of unnatural intersections or segments that appear to float. The depiction of the cape is coherent and visually plausible, reflecting correct behavior and form.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the rolling hills and distant castle integrated smoothly into the scene with consistent lighting and shadow alignment, avoiding sharp edges or color discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background comprising rolling hills and a distant castle is seamlessly integrated into the scene. The lighting is consistent with the sunset atmosphere, casting uniform shadows that align with the light source. The transitions between the different elements of the scene are smooth, and there are no sharp edges or color discontinuities. This suggests that the integration of the background is harmonious and visually coherent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character’s right hand holding the scepter show five correctly shaped fingers with natural joint alignment and skin texture, without deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the character's right hand in Image B, we observe that the fingers are correctly shaped and naturally aligned. The skin texture appears realistic, with no signs of deformation or additional digits. The hand is depicted accurately with attention to anatomical details, suggesting a realistic representation. The visual cues confirm that there is no unnatural distortion present.",
