      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the chibi-style 3D models of the sheep and clock free from unnatural textures and maintain their fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep and clock inside the snow globe are designed in a chibi style, characterized by exaggerated features and simplified textures. The sheep has a smooth, even wool texture and round eyes typical of chibi design, while the clock retains its polished metallic finish, suggesting that the models are free from unnatural textures. Combining visual cues like the consistent art style with knowledge about chibi style, these models appear well-rendered without any odd errors.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the sheep appear naturally leaning against the clock without any distortion or unnatural positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep is positioned close to the clock, maintaining a balanced and harmonious arrangement inside the confines of the snow globe. Given their intended purpose to fit together inside a rounded space, the models maintain their structural integrity without apparent distortion or forced positioning. The visual cues imply a coherent compliance with how 3D models fit inside globes naturally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the gently drifting snowflakes inside the snow globe add to the scene naturally without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows several small white spotted snowflakes scattered evenly inside the snow globe. World knowledge about snowflake patterns in globes suggests they move smoothly and randomly to imitate snowfall. The distribution and shape of snowflakes appear normal, supporting that they add realistically to the atmosphere without artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wooden tabletop and warm, neutral-toned background create a visually harmonious and cozy atmosphere without any inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange-toned background and wooden tabletop complement each other, creating a cozy atmosphere through the warm colors and unified design palette. Knowledge of interior design emphasizes the harmony between warm wood and muted tones to evoke comfort. There are no glaring inconsistencies in the textures or colors that would disrupt the visual harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the snow globe, sheep, clock, and tabletop consistent and logical?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a snow globe sitting on the tabletop with the sheep and clock inside, all in proportionally scaled dimensions typical for such decorative items. The globe's size relative to the items inside is realistic, given the typical dimensions of ornamental snow globes, without causing logical incongruities. Visual analysis shows proportional consistency across all elements, aligning with common decorative setups.",
