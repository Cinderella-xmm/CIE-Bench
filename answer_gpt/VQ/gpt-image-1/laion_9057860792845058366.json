    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the reflections on the robot’s body uniform and physically consistent with a metallic surface, without streaks, over-saturation, or mismatched highlight areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) depicts a robot with a shiny metallic surface. In analyzing the reflections, they appear smooth and uniform, characteristics consistent with a well-rendered metallic surface. There are no visible streaks or areas of over-saturation, and the highlights are distributed evenly, enhancing the perception of a glossy metal finish. These observations suggest intentional and consistent reflection work, typical of high-quality digital rendering of metallic objects.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the holographic display on the chest transparent and layered above the surface without warping or clipping into the surrounding armor plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the holographic display on the robot's chest, it appears see-through and floats above the armor surface. There's distinct layering, and the holographic effect doesn't show any signs of warping or clipping into the robot's structure. The edges are well-defined, further supporting that the holographic layer is intended to be independent, as would be expected from a futuristic tech gadget.",

      "question": "Are the control icons in the digital interface overlay sharp, readable, and positioned without overlapping key mechanical components such as the shoulders or torso joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The control icons in the digital overlay are evaluated and found to be clear and sharply defined. They do not overlap with the robot's mechanical components, which ensures readability and maintains the design integrity of the robot's structure. Such placement and clarity in the digital interface are deliberate to prevent visual noise and ensure functionality.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the smartwatch accessory attached to the forearm without bending or deforming the arm’s structure, and does it have a clean, seamless connection point consistent with magnetic attachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smartwatch accessory is shown attached to the robot’s forearm. The connection appears seamless, suggesting a well-integrated design. It doesn't visibly alter or deform the robot's arm structure, indicating a thoughtful attachment method possibly mimicking magnetic connections found in real products. The design consistency suggests a high level of care in merging wearable tech with robotics.",

      "question": "Are the floating tech interface symbols in the background evenly spaced, sharp-edged, and free from jagged outlines or ghosting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The interface symbols floating in the background of Image B are evenly spaced and possess sharp edges. They are free from jagged outlines and ghosting effects, which contributes to a tidy and professional appearance typical of high-end digital renders. The consistent icon quality enhances the cohesive tech-themed aesthetic.",
