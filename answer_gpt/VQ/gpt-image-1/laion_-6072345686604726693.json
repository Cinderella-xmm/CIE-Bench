      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the metallic wing structures exhibit uniform reflective properties and smooth surface transitions without visible seams or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic wing structures have a detailed design featuring intricate patterns and reflective surfaces. The reflections appear uniform across the surface, which suggests a high quality of rendering. There is also no visible repetition or segmentation of textures, indicating that the surface transitions are smooth. This suggests the editing was performed with attention to detail to maintain surface cohesion and continuity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leg-like structures derived from the minarets proportionally consistent with the rest of the structure and do they show natural curvature and joint-like articulation without stretching or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leg-like structures have a design that integrates with the main body of the building, showing an artistic translation of the architectural style into a mechanical construct. The proportions of the legs appear well-balanced with the overall design, avoiding exaggerated stretching. The joints suggest realistic articulation without visible warping, which fits with the aesthetic of a fictional steampunk-like transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the central jewel reflect light and cosmic patterns in a way that matches the direction of sunlight and surrounding environment, without appearing to float or casting inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central jewel in Image B, representing a cosmic portal, shows a harmonious blend of cosmic patterns with its environment. The reflections and emitted light are consistent with the assumed source of illumination, maintaining a realistic integration into the overall scene. There are no obvious indications of the jewel appearing out of place or detached from the rest of the structure, emphasizing a seamless integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing patterns confined to surface-level details, following architectural lines, and do they emit light that blends with ambient illumination without creating harsh glows or obscuring textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing patterns are carefully confined to the ornate surface-level details of the structure. They adhere to the architectural elements without overwhelming them. The light emitted from these patterns blends smoothly with the ambient lighting, avoiding harshness and preserving the clarity and visibility of underlying textures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, blurring, or color discontinuities at the junctions between the original building and the transformed elements such as wings, legs, or jewel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no apparent seams, blurring, or color mismatches that disrupt the cohesion between the original structural elements and the newly added fantastical components. The color palette and shading are consistent throughout the image, indicating meticulous attention to the merging process of various parts.",
