      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the kernel wearing autumn attire maintain consistent size and texture with real corn kernels, and does the clothing appear seamlessly integrated without visible edges or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the kernel wearing a scarf and a hat is styled in a cartoonish manner. The size and texture are deliberately exaggerated to give it a character-like appearance rather than resembling real corn kernels. The clothing is part of this chibi-style representation and is seamlessly integrated into the character's design as there are no visible inconsistencies in edge or texture, fitting the playful and artistic style intended in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the energy lines emanating from the popcorn pieces smooth and consistent with the direction of motion, and do they avoid intersecting or distorting the popcorn shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the energy lines drawn around the popcorn pieces are smooth and radiate outward, consistent with portraying an active, dynamic motion or 'popping' effect. These lines do not intersect or distort the popcorn shapes, maintaining a harmonious and clear aesthetic that enhances the popcorn imagery in a cartoon manner.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the popcorn piece with the explorer hat properly scaled and textured, and do the spices and pumpkin elements adjacent to it appear naturally positioned without overlapping distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the popcorn piece with the explorer hat is depicted with a proper scale relative to the general size of the popcorn characters. The spices and pumpkin are placed as adjacent graphical elements rather than physical objects, creating a non-overlapping, visually coherent illustration. The cartoon style allows for a simplified representation without realistic textural detail or placement distortion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the popcorn pieces entering the ceramic bowls follow a downward trajectory consistent with gravity, and do they remain within the bowl boundaries without appearing to float above or clip through the rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the popcorn pieces depicted in a celebratory manner are not shown in motion above bowls, but they do appear placed or jumping with an implied movement within a bowl. As such, they do not show a downward trajectory typical of physical movement; instead, they maintain a stationary position. However, they do not appear to float or clip through the rim, staying within the bowl boundaries consistent with the playful illustration style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the added elements (such as hats, energy lines, and spices) consistent with the original orange-brown theme, and do they lack over-saturation or color bleeding at edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of orange and brown tones for the chibi characters, including their attire and surrounding elements, aligns well with the pumpkin spice theme. The colors are consistent and complementary to the background, without over-saturation or bleeding at the edges. The illustrated style allows these elements to integrate smoothly without any jarring color clashes.",
