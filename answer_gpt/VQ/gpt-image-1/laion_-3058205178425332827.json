      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the color transitions in the sky, sea, and buildings smooth and free of sharp digital edges or unnatural color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, smooth color transitions provide a more appealing and realistic look, especially in an illustrated style. The sky exhibits a gradient from pink to blue, which is typical for sunset views, and this transition is smooth without abrupt changes. Similarly, in the sea and building areas, the colors are blended with soft transitions, avoiding harsh edges or abrupt color changes, which indicates a natural look consistent with traditional illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the anthropomorphic cat character positioned on a rooftop with correct scale relative to nearby buildings, and does it have a natural pose without deformed limbs or distorted anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat character is placed in the foreground, facing towards the cityscape with a thoughtful posture. Its size appears scaled appropriately relative to the nearby building, maintaining a natural and harmonious scene. The pose is typical of an anthropomorphic cartoon figure, with limbs and tail appropriately shaped for a standing posture, indicating consideration of correct anatomy in the illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text 'Pepper the Cat's Neapolitan Adventure: Searching for the Legendary Vesuvian Treasure' fully visible, positioned within the margin area, and not overlapping with key architectural features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text is positioned at the top of the image in Image B, clearly within the margin area, ensuring that it does not interfere with key visual elements like the architectural features seen in the center and bottom portions of the image. The visibility of the text is clear, and there are no overlaps that would obscure the readability or distract from other elements in the illustration.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the decorative borders along all four edges of the image continuous, symmetrical, and free of gaps or misaligned tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decorative borders in Image B appear along the left and right sides only based on the provided image. They are designed symmetrically with a repeating floral motif and do not show any gaps or misalignment. The continuous nature of the border adds to the aesthetic framing of the image, maintaining a neat and composed look.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the added cat character and border elements align with the light source direction seen in the sky and buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The light source direction, suggested by the sunset gradient in the sky, implies warm lighting from the left horizon. The cat character is illuminated with warm tones reflecting this direction, with shadows falling in congruence with the light source perspective established by the buildings' shading and the overall image context. The border elements, however, are stylistically two-dimensional and therefore don't display shadows or highlights.",
