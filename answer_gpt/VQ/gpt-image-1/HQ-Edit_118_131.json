    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the added gears and copper accents seamlessly integrated into the silver surface of the teapot without visible texture inconsistencies or material discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot features a combination of mechanical gears and copper accents. The integration of these elements is examined for texture consistency and material continuity. The design manifests as one coherent piece with no visible texture mismatch or abrupt material transitions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the curved glass dome appear transparent and smoothly contoured without geometric distortions or artificial edges that break the illusion of a real glass enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B is analyzed for transparency and smooth curvature, characteristic of real glass. It should exhibit natural light behavior without distortions or visually disruptive edges, validating the illusion of a real glass dome.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wooden floorboards and scattered tea leaves rendered with realistic textures and proportions, and do the tiny silver utensils appear appropriately scaled and detailed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows wooden floorboards, tea leaves, and silver utensils. The textures should mimic real wood and leaves with appropriate scaling, while the silver utensils should be detailed in line with common size ratios found in miniature setups.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the moss accents naturally distributed along the base edge, with soft, organic texture and no signs of unnatural clustering or color mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's moss accents are evaluated for distribution along the base. The moss should exhibit a natural texture and color consistency, avoiding any artificial grouping or mismatches in tone.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the steam effect emerging from the elephant's trunk appear as a smooth, translucent vapor with natural diffusion and no jagged edges or artificial glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steam coming out of the teapot's spout should be smooth and vapor-like, with natural diffusion properties typical of real steam, without any sharply defined edges or unnatural brightness.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the vine-like metalwork elements consistently shaped and positioned around the dome, following natural curvatures without intersecting the glass unnaturally or creating inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metalwork elements in Image B are assessed for consistency in shape and positioning. Proper alignment with the dome's curves should be maintained without overlapping or conflicting with the glass structure, ensuring shadow behavior remains natural.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
