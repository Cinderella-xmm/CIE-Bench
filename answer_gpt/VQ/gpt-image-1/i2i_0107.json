    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the chibi version preserve distinct facial features like hair texture and glasses in a way that remains visually consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi version simplifies and stylizes certain features for a cartoon-like appearance, maintaining recognizable elements such as the hairstyle and round glasses. This captures the essence of the original character despite a different artistic approach.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scarf and the wand being held in the hand rendered with natural textures that match the other elements in the chibi figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figure shows a simplified design without natural textures, typical of a cartoon style where elements like the scarf and wand are visually consistent in their stylized simplicity but not natural.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand holding the wand proportionate with the rest of the chibi figure's body, and does it look anatomically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi design, proportions are exaggerated or altered for aesthetic effect, typical in such styles. Although the hand may seem smaller, it fits the overall chibi proportion without looking awkward.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the chibi character blend naturally into the wooden background without any visible artifacts or unnatural shadows that disrupt the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character is an isolated element against the wooden background, held by a hand. There's a clear separation between the character and background without artifacts or unnatural disruptions, common in non-natural settings like this.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scarf and tie designed with coherent shapes that do not introduce any broken or distorted geometries, preserving the chibi aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scarf and tie in the chibi figure are rendered with clean, smooth shapes, fitting the typical chibi aesthetic without distorted or broken geometries.",
      "weight": 1,
