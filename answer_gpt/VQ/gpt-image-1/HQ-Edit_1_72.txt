    "Question": "Q1: Are the gold embellishments on the Dashiki naturally integrated into the fabric, showing realistic reflective properties and no floating or pixelated edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold embellishments appear seamlessly integrated into the Dashiki fabric, showing realistic reflective properties where the light interacts with the design. The patterns are consistent and well-defined, without any floating aspects or visible pixelation. The embellishments maintain a cohesive presence with the texture of the fabric, suggesting a natural integration rather than a digitally imposed effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the beads and symbols on the shoulders align correctly with the shoulder anatomy and exhibit natural material textures without distortion or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the beads and symbols on the shoulders are positioned to align with the shoulder anatomy. They follow the natural curve of the shoulders, and their textures exhibit depth and detail consistent with physical beads. There is no noticeable distortion or misalignment that would suggest they are unnaturally placed, indicating a realistic depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the Acacia trees in the background proportionally accurate and structurally coherent, with natural branching patterns and no visible geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows Acacia trees in the background that have characteristic flat-topped canopies and branching patterns typical of this species. The proportions and structural coherence are consistent with real Acacia trees, with no visible geometric distortions. The placement and size variations give a natural depth to the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the wild grass in the foreground and midground display natural variation in height, color, and orientation, avoiding repetitive or tiled patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wild grass shows a variety of heights, colors, and orientations, contributing to a sense of natural randomness. There are no repetitive patterns or tiling effects that would suggest digital manipulation, which supports a realistic portrayal of a grassland environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the hands show five fingers each, with natural joint alignment, skin texture, and shading that matches the rest of the figure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are visible with five fingers each. The joint alignment appears natural, and the skin texture is consistent with the rest of the figure. The shading reflects appropriate light interaction that matches the overall lighting of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
