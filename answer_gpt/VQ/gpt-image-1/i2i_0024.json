      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figure in Image B is designed to be cartoonish and simplified, which is characteristic of chibi art where figures have oversized heads and smaller bodies. The figure holds a tennis racket and maintains a consistent style typical for this art form, with no visible stretching or distortion in its proportions. This observation comes from understanding the chibi art style, which intentionally simplifies and exaggerates certain features for cuteness.",
