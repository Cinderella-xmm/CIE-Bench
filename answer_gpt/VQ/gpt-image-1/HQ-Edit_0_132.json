      "question": "Do the three figures retain anatomically correct body proportions and natural hand shapes (with no more than five fingers per hand) after being stylized as ink-painting poets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are stylized in the form of an ink painting. Each figure's body proportions appear consistent with human anatomy, even though they are rendered in an artistic style. The hands of the figures show clear delineation with fingers that are appropriate to human hand anatomy, without any visible distortion or extra fingers.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the willow branches and lotus leaves rendered with smooth, flowing brushstrokes that preserve their natural form and do not exhibit jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the willow branches and lotus leaves using smooth brushstrokes typical of ink paintings, which should not have jagged edges. The natural forms are preserved well, and the outline is fluid and flowing in nature, characteristic of traditional ink artistry. An ink painting should reflect the calm and smooth nature of these plant elements.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mountain background feature soft, layered ink-wash gradients that blend naturally with the surrounding mist and sky without sharp transitions or artificial blur effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the mountain background with gradients typical of ink-wash techniques, which create blended transitions with surrounding mist and sky. These gradients are smooth without abrupt edges or artificial blur. The misty backdrop facilitates a natural blending, which is a hallmark of ink-wash style, presenting an ethereal, soft-quality landscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the arm and hand positions of the figures show natural joint alignment and fluid motion, with no bent or missing fingers or unnatural limb extensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures' arm and hand positions display natural movement and alignment, which is important to convey fluidity in an ink painting. The hands seem to articulate appropriate gestures without any unnatural bending or missing elements. This contributes to the graceful portrayal typical of ink paintings capturing human figures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the ink-style elements (figures, willows, lotuses, mountains) harmoniously integrated into the scene with consistent lighting, shadow, and depth cues, and do they avoid appearing detached or misplaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows harmony and integration between the ink-style elements, such as the figures, willows, lotus, and mountains. There is a consistency in lighting and depth, contributing to an immersive portrayal, with no element looking out of place. Traditionally, ink paintings follow a rhythm and balance in composition, supporting the connectedness and coherence of the scene.",
