      "question": "Is the logo on the hammer handle seamlessly integrated with no visible texture mismatch, jagged edges, or unnatural color contrast compared to the surrounding wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo on the hammer handle can be analyzed by observing the integration of the design with the wood grain. The logo should not exhibit any jagged edges or color contrast that stands out against the natural wood texture. The seamless integration suggests that the design is consistent with the existing material. If there's no visible texture mismatch and the color matches the wood tones, the integration can be considered seamless.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the letters on the wood shavings follow the natural curvature and thickness of each shaving without appearing flattened, stretched, or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The letters on the wood shavings should adhere to the curvature and contours of each piece. This involves analyzing whether the text adopts the same angles and curves as the shaved wood. If the letters do not appear to be stretched or unnaturally flat compared to the shape of the wood, they follow the natural form of the wood shavings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the rustic banner at the top align with the lighting and shadows of the scene, and does its texture appear consistent with natural aged wood or fabric rather than digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the banner in Image B involves checking its consistency with the scene's lighting and shadows. It should appropriately reflect the ambient light and cast shadows that match the other elements of the image. Furthermore, the texture of the banner should look naturally rustic, perhaps wooden or fabric, rather than an overly smooth or artificial digital element. If these elements align, it suggests a realistic integration.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the copper accents on the pegboard evenly lit and shaded, matching the surrounding grayscale tones without creating unrealistic reflections or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Copper accents should display appropriate lighting and shadowing, consistent with the scene's grayscale and tonal variations. Inspection includes observing whether light interacts with these accents naturally or if there is a mismatch in color or brightness. Smooth integration without abrupt shifts indicates consistency with the surrounding tones.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the business card positioned with correct perspective and scale relative to the tools and workbench, and does it cast a subtle shadow consistent with the ambient light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The assessment of the business card involves evaluating its perspective and scale to ensure it fits well within the context of the scene. It should align proportionately with other objects like the tools and bench. Additionally, it should cast a subtle shadow that corresponds with the scene's light source, suggesting proper integration with ambient lighting.",
