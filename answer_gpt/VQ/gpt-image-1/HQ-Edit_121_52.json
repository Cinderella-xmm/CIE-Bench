      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the limbs of the astronaut proportionally consistent with human anatomy, and do they avoid unnatural bends or distortions in the joints when enlarged with zig-zag motion lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is drawn in a cartoonish or chibi style, which frequently involves intentionally exaggerated or stylized proportions, such as larger heads and shorter limbs compared to human anatomy. This style often features simplified or exaggerated limb shapes, and the motion lines are a common animation-style depiction to emphasize movement. Considering these artistic choices, the limbs appear appropriately proportionate for the chosen art style, despite not aligning with human anatomical proportions. Thus, for the style chosen, the limbs do not show unnatural bends or distortions given the intended art form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the celestial motifs applied to the suit exhibit uniform texture and shading that aligns with the material appearance of the spacesuit, without visible seams or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the celestial motifs are in the form of stars and decorations on a stylized cartoon spacesuit. The motifs follow the flat, graphic style of the illustration, where shading and texture typically do not mimic realistic material appearances but rather serve as embellishments in the cartoon design. Given this flat illustrative style, the motifs appear consistent with the overall aesthetic and do not introduce seams or artifacts inappropriate for the cartoon format.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the illustrated moon surface positioned at the correct depth and scale relative to the astronaut’s feet and shadow, with no visible gaps or misalignment between the figure and ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is depicted in a cartoon style with stylized elements. The moon surface is illustrated in a simple, flattened manner, typical of cartoon representations. The positioning seems deliberate to match this artistic style, where realistic depth and alignment are often secondary to maintaining a whimsical or exaggerated appearance. There do not appear to be obvious misalignments or gaps considering the intended cartoon nature.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the astronaut’s face retain natural facial proportions and feature alignment, such as symmetrical eyes and a defined jawline, without excessive smoothing or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the face is blurred, the art style suggests a cartoon representation where facial features are typically exaggerated or simplified in proportion. Such styles inherently opt for symmetry and clear alignments as part of their charm and visual appeal, avoiding excessive smoothing beyond their intended design. Without assessing specific details due to the blur, the art style fundamentally leans towards appropriate feature alignment in context.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the space-themed border evenly aligned around the image edge without overlapping or cutting into the astronaut or background elements, and does the simulated card stock texture appear uniform and free of repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a space-themed border that appears evenly aligned around the edges of the illustration. This alignment is a common feature in illustrated designs to maintain visual appeal and coherence. The border does not seem to overlap or intrude into the main elements, which is crucial for preserving the illustration's integrity. The texture of the simulated card stock also appears uniform, matching the intended visual style without visible repetition, which suggests consistent design execution.",
