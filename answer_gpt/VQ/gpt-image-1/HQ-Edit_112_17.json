      "question": "Does the hammer's handle display a uniform deep blue enamel surface with no visible cracks, rough patches, or color variations, and does the head show realistic metallic sheen with consistent reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer handle is adorned with a deep blue enamel coating that is consistent and smooth, indicating no cracks or rough patches. The enamel surface reflects light evenly, exhibiting no visible color variations. The hammer's head in Image B demonstrates a realistic metallic sheen, its reflective surface showing consistent illumination that is typical of metal objects under lighting. These visual cues confirm the description of the handle's and head's surface characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the chisel, file, wrench, and pliers retain their original shapes and proportions, with smooth, reflective enamel surfaces and no warped edges, missing details, or inconsistent material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tools including chisel, file, wrench, and pliers are shown with a consistent enamel coating that is smooth and reflective, typical of a polished surface. Their shapes and proportions appear to be intact, without any warping or missing details. Transitions between materials or sections of the tools show consistency, with no abrupt changes or irregularities, which indicates an attention to maintaining original design integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the enamel shavings shaped into natural-looking curls with varied thickness and smooth, glossy surfaces, avoiding flat or rigid appearances and maintaining fine detail along the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the enamel shavings are depicted as naturally curled, resembling wood shavings. They exhibit varied thickness and shiny surfaces, giving them a smooth and glossy appearance. The edges of these shavings are detailed and refined, avoiding any flat or overly rigid look that could detract from their realistic representation. This suggests careful attention to achieving an authentic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the linen fabric background show a natural weave texture with soft folds and slight color variation, and does it provide a visually coherent base for the enamel tools without appearing artificial or overly smooth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a linen fabric that displays a natural woven texture. There are no visible folds as the fabric appears flat, but it does have subtle color variations giving it depth. It provides a coherent base upon which the tools are laid, serving as a neutral background that accentuates the enamel work, without coming across as artificial or lacking texture.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows and highlights on the enamel tools consistent with a single light source and the reflective nature of enamel, and do all tools rest naturally on the fabric without gaps, floating effects, or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows and highlights on the tools align with a single light source, as indicated by consistent shadow placement and light reflection patterns across each object. This consistency highlights the reflective nature of enamel. The positioning of the tools shows they are resting naturally on the fabric background, without any gaps or floating effects, and their edges are aligned properly with the surface they are on.",
