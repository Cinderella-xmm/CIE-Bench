      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks forming the hot dog uniformly shaped, properly aligned, and free of distorted or misshapen pieces that compromise structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog is constructed using LEGO bricks, which are known for their uniform shape and ability to snap together precisely. The components are organized in a manner typical of LEGO constructions, where each piece aligns well with others, maintaining symmetrical and consistent structuring. Given these traits, the hot dog depicted here is likely without any distortion or misalignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the ceramic mosaic bottle feature smooth, non-glass-like surfaces with clearly defined geometric patterns in red, yellow, and tan, without unnatural reflections or transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is seen with distinct geometric patterns composed of red, yellow, and blue LEGO-like pieces. The surface appears matte and smooth, typical of colored LEGO plastic pieces, which do not exhibit reflections akin to glass and remain opaque. This setup enhances the clarity of the geometric patterns visible on the bottle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the LEGO hot dog's length proportionally consistent with the original hot dog’s size relative to the cutting board and nearby objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To assess proportionality, we first consider Image A, where the hot dog rests upon a cutting board and stretches nearly its entire length. Upon inspecting Image B, the LEGO hot dog also spans most of the cutting board space, similar to the original hot dog’s proportions. Both structures maintain a parallel listing with surrounding elements, indicating a consistent relational scale.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the ceramic bottle have a rounded, flowing shape with no sharp angles or blocky geometry that would disrupt visual harmony with the LEGO hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is constructed with LEGO pieces depicting a rounded shape, characterized by curves and a spherical form. While LEGO structures inherently possess angular characteristics, the arrangement here mimics a smooth silhouette, aligning visually with the rounded shape of the LEGO hot dog beside it.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden base under both the LEGO hot dog and ceramic bottle seamless, with consistent wood grain and color matching the surrounding table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base, which supports both the LEGO hot dog and bottle, displays consistency in color and texture with the nearby table surface. The grain appears uniform and the color palette matches well, contributing to seamless integration with its surroundings. This cohesion illustrates a design harmonized in wood consistency.",
