      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the gullwing doors reshaped into raised, rounded button-like structures symmetrically placed on both sides of the car, with smooth transitions from the body and no visible warping or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gullwing doors are not present as it is not an image of a car but rather of a game controller. The image depicts a controller with certain features such as shoulder buttons, which could be interpreted as similar to button-like structures, but they are not directly related to the concept of gullwing doors from a car. Since no such reshaped structures related to a car's gullwing doors are present in the image, the correct option is No.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the front grille redesigned into a four-segment cross-shaped directional pad with evenly spaced and aligned sections, centered beneath the Mercedes emblem, and free from overlapping or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a game controller, not a car. The design elements include a directional pad but not in the format of a car's grille. Given that a controller has a distinct and separate design from car design, the concept of a grille being redesigned does not apply in this context. Therefore, the answer is No.",

      "question": "Does the entire exterior surface exhibit consistent metallic red coloring with smooth gloss highlights that follow the curvature of the body and reflect ambient light realistically without abrupt transitions or flat areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the game controller is predominantly metallic red with smooth gloss highlights that follow its curves, reflecting light realistically. These gloss effects are consistent with the way light interacts with curved glossy surfaces, indicating an accurate representation of metallic paint. Hence, the answer is Yes.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a detailed emblem located on the dashboard area, resembling a central control button, with clear lines and shading that match the surrounding interior materials and do not appear displaced or blurry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a prominent emblem located on the controller, which resembles a central control feature of a gamepad rather than a car dashboard. This emblem has clear lines and appropriate shading, matching the sleek design of the controller. Therefore, the answer is Yes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a branded logo placed centrally on the hood, shaped like a circular control element with defined edges and consistent depth, and aligned with the carâ€™s longitudinal axis without tilting or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shape and context relate to a game controller, not a car. The branded logo on the controller is centrally placed and aligns correctly with the design, but it cannot be described as being on the hood of a car. Thus, the comparison doesn't apply, making the answer No.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all edited components (shoulder buttons, D-pad grille, hood logo) fully attached to the car body with no floating parts, misaligned joints, or unnatural bends in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts a game controller rather than a car; hence, there are no car components like a hood logo or D-pad grille. However, the controller's components, like shoulder buttons, are fully attached without any floating parts or misalignments. Given the correct context, the answer is Yes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a game controller with a polished look, free from any visible artifacts like jagged lines, repeated patterns, or unnatural reflections. The boundaries of the components are clear and well-integrated into the design. Hence, the answer is No.",
