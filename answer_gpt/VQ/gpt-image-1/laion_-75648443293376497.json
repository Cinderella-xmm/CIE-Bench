      "question": "Does the leather texture across the backpack's main body appear uniformly consistent in grain, color, and thickness without unnatural seams or patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leather texture across the backpack appears uniformly consistent in terms of grain, color, and thickness. The entire surface exhibits a homogeneous appearance without any visible seams or patches, which is typical for illustrations conveying a vintage leather aesthetic. The image has been created likely with a digital illustration technique aimed at maintaining a smooth and consistent surface texture, giving the backpack a classic look. No inconsistencies or alterations in texture such as seams or patches can be observed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the buckle surfaces altered to display a brass-like finish with subtle tarnishing and realistic light reflection, without deformed shapes or mismatched highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buckle surfaces appear to have a brass-like finish with subtle tarnishing. They reflect light realistically, which aligns with common characteristics of brass material. The shapes of the buckles seem well-formed and do not display any deformations. The highlights on the buckles match the viewing angle, giving a realistic appearance consistent with expectations for metallic objects in vintage-style illustrations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the travel patches positioned on the side pockets with proper alignment to the stitching and fabric contours, showing no warping or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the travel patches on the side pockets are aligned properly with the contours of the fabric and stitching. They appear naturally positioned, tightly adherent to the backpack's surface. There is no warping or floating appearance, which is crucial for maintaining the perception of realistic patch application on fabric surfaces. The alignment is consistent with the way patches would logically be sewn or adhered to a backpack in real life.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the \"EXPLORE VINTAGE\" text clearly visible on the front flap, properly aligned with the flap’s curvature, and free from jagged edges or ghosting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'EXPLORE VINTAGE' text is clearly visible and excellently aligned with the flap's curvature. The text seems well integrated and follows the natural curve of the backpack's flap, giving it a fitted appearance. The edges of the text are smooth, with no jagged effects or ghosting, suggesting attention to detail in typography and digital rendering, accomplishing the intended vintage look without quality compromise.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the compass graphic near the base of the backpack rendered with fine, consistent lines that follow a circular pattern and do not distort the surrounding leather texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the compass graphic near the base of the backpack is rendered with fine, consistent lines that comprise a clear circular pattern. The graphic's implementation does not distort the surrounding leather texture, maintaining a smooth surface. Such careful depiction through consistent line work ensures the compass remains distinct while integrating seamlessly with the backpack’s design, which reflects proficiency in illustration design.",
