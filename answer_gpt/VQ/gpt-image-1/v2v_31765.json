      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the diced vegetables maintain their structural coherence and visual credibility after being transformed into a Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which has been transformed into a Cubist style, the diced vegetables are represented with geometric shapes that reflect a deliberate abstraction typical of Cubism. The cubist approach often features fragmented and geometric representation, which inherently affects the structural coherence as seen in the transformation. Although the shapes retain some degree of dice-like form, their coherence is altered to fit the style's abstract nature. This transformation results in a visually credible representation for the Cubist style but does change the structural coherence compared to the natural presentation in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the diced carrots, celery, and onions natural and detailed, without any obvious loss of detail in the Cubist style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation into a Cubist style inherently results in a loss of natural texture detail. The focus of Cubism is on shapes and forms rather than realistic textures, which means that fine details that contribute to a natural appearance are abstracted into geometric patterns. Thus, while the shapes are abstractly represented, the textures are not detailed as they would be in a non-Cubist representation, indicating a loss of realistic texture detail.",

      "question": "Do the colors of the diced carrots, celery, and onions appear authentic and harmonious, contributing to the overall natural appearance in the Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B in the Cubist style maintains the colors of the vegetables, with the carrots, celery, and onions still distinguishable by their respective orange, green, and white hues. These colors remain consistent with the original colors seen in vegetables, thus appearing authentic. Additionally, the Cubist style often incorporates harmonious color schemes to create a cohesive abstract image. Thus, even though the style is abstract, the colors contribute to an aesthetically pleasing and harmonious appearance.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the diced vegetables intact and undistorted, without any broken edges or unnatural deformations in the Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is a Cubist representation, the geometric shapes are an intentional abstraction that includes fragmented and angular forms. The style itself embraces a form of distortion, with edges appearing broken and shapes intentionally abstracted. While these are not 'distortions' in a negative sense, they represent a deliberate alteration from the smooth and intact geometry of the original context in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the knife retain its natural appearance and structural integrity, without any obvious artifacts or distortions in the Cubist style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife has been transformed into the Cubist style, resulting in angular and faceted representations typical of this art style. The knife's overall shape is maintained, but it is composed of geometric facets and lines, which represent a deliberate artistic abstraction. Despite this stylistic transformation, it retains enough characteristics to be recognizable as a knife, maintaining its structural identity within the constraints of the Cubist art style.",
