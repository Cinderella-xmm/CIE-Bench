      "question": "Does the isometric representation of the figurine box maintain consistent angles and edges without distorted or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine box depicted seems to be constructed with precise isometric angles as all sides of the box, including its top, front, and side, show consistent edges and angles. This consistency is an essential aspect of isometric drawings to ensure the geometry appears intact and not distorted. The clear and even edges suggest professional design and alignment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral-themed accents on the figurine box proportionally sized and textured in a way that matches the material and style of the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a figurine box with floral-themed accents that appear well-integrated into the box design. The flowers are proportionally sized, fitting the box’s sides and matching the simple, decorative style indicative of floral embellishments seen on such boxes. This suggests an intentional and harmonious design decision, not overpowering the box's primary theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the chibi cat figure positioned correctly within the box, with its body fully contained and aligned with the interior space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi cat figure is shown outside of the box, not inside. The box features an illustration of the cat, but the actual figure appears separately, standing beside the box, thus it is not positioned within the interior of the box.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the eyes of the chibi cat exhibit smooth, uniform glass-like reflection without visible pixelation or irregular highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi cat in Image B possesses eyes with a significant shine that mimics a glass-like surface. The reflections are smooth and uniformly distributed across the eyes' surface without signs of pixelation or irregular highlights, indicating a high-quality rendering of reflective properties.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the fur texture of the realistic cat figure beside the box show consistent flow and detail comparable to the original cat’s fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a chibi-style cat rather than a realistic one. The fur texture on this type of figure typically lacks the intricate detail found in the realistic portrayal given in Image A. Therefore, it does not maintain the realistic consistency or detail shown in Image A’s realistic cat figure due to the figurine's stylized and simplified nature.",
