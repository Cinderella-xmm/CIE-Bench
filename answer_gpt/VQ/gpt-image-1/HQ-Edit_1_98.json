      "question": "Does the floral engraving on the dress appear seamlessly integrated into the fabric without visible texture breaks, misaligned patterns, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral engraving on the dress is examined for any texture inconsistencies or pattern misalignments. The engraving should appear continuous across the dress fabric, ensuring that each floral pattern aligns with adjacent ones without visible gaps or distortion and that highlights are harmonious with the dress curvature.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sepia tones applied uniformly across all elements (including skin, dress, violin, window frame, and plants) without localized color distortions or loss of detail in shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a sepia tone for a vintage look. This tone should be consistent across all elements, ensuring no part is overly dark, shadowy, or washed out. In this edited image, the uniform sepia effect is observed across the dress, skin, violin, and other elements, maintaining detail in both shadows and highlights.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the abstract swirls in the window view remain confined within the window panes and align correctly with their borders, without overlapping into the room or distorting the window structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the abstract swirls need to be fully contained within the designated window panes, aligning precisely with the pane edges, without extending into the indoor space or altering the window's physical structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gold inlays on the violin positioned along logical contours of the instrument and do they exhibit consistent metallic sheen and reflection without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, assessing the gold inlays involves ensuring they follow the violinâ€™s shape naturally, preserving the instrument's form and highlight, with a cohesive reflective quality expected in metallic surfaces. Here, the gold details adhere correctly along the violin's contours, maintaining a natural metallic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the handwritten music score border evenly spaced, legible, and aligned along the image edge without intersecting or obscuring any part of the violinist, window, or foreground objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the music score border should run parallel to the image edge, maintaining even spacing and clarity without overlapping any central figures or objects in the scene. It is observed here that the border is aligned correctly and does not intrude upon other visual elements.",
