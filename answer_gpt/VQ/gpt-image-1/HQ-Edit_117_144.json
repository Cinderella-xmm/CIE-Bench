    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the golden scepter in the man's right hand have a smooth, reflective metallic surface that matches the lighting conditions without exhibiting unnatural texture artifacts or inconsistent highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden scepter held by the man features a design typical for such objects—smooth and reflective. This suggests a metallic surface that would catch light, producing highlights. The scepter seems consistent with common design principles for such items, showing appropriate light reflections without artifacts. Therefore, based on the image, it displays a realistic surface texture appropriate for lighting conditions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pastel-colored fabrics of the man’s coat, vest, trousers, and shirt rendered with visible texture and depth, maintaining natural folds and shadows without appearing flat or washed out?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the man’s clothing with a cartoonish style, which might simplify details like shadows and folds. However, the lines and shading simulate depth and texture, aligning with typical cartoon representations that aim to maintain visual appeal despite simplification. The fabrics are colorful yet do not lose depth through oversimplification.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cobblestones beneath the man’s feet form a continuous, evenly spaced pattern with natural irregularities and consistent shading, avoiding broken or misaligned stones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cobblestones appear stylized, yet maintain a coherent pattern. The cartoon aesthetic generally supports simplified yet continuous patterns that favor design symmetry and structural continuity. The pattern appears uniform, adhering to general expectations of cobblestone pathways in such illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the detachable note sections placed along the outer edges of the image without overlapping the man or background architecture, and do they have clean, uniform borders resembling paper cutouts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The detachable note sections in Image B are strategically positioned around the man, not overlapping any significant part of his figure or the background, respecting the typical layout found in templates. The borders are clean and uniform, resembling paper cutouts commonly found in paper-craft designs or scrapbook layouts, fitting within expected design norms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the man’s right hand gripping the scepter show five clearly defined fingers with natural joint angles and no deformation, while the left hand in the pocket maintains a relaxed, anatomically accurate pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stylized representation in which anatomical details are simplified for stylistic purposes. The right hand gripping the scepter illustrates finger visibility and correct hand posture, although simplified, conforms to expected joint angles. The left hand in the pocket is shown in a typical relaxed pose, emphasized by the loose depiction and expected cartoon simplification.",
