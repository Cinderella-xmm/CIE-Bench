    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style warrior retain the long hair and muscled neckline with proportional scaling and without unnatural deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style warrior retains the long white hair characteristic of the original figure, adjusting proportions to fit the chibi form correctly. The hair is styled in a manner consistent with the original, despite the chibi proportions. The muscled neckline has been simplified, maintaining proportions that match the typical chibi aesthetic, which is known for exaggerating features but remains logical within that art style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the icy armor transparent with visible internal reflections and no solid or jagged edges that suggest digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the icy armor appears to have a slightly translucent quality, indicating some internal reflections. However, the armor edges are well-defined without jagged or digital artifact-like interruptions, suggesting it is a smooth digital rendition of ice armor.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ice shards evenly distributed around the figure, small enough to fit the snow globe scale, and textured like real ice without repeating patterns or floating anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ice shards are fit appropriately within the snow globe's scale. They have varied textures that mimic real ice, and their distribution around the figure is balanced, with no evident repeating patterns or floating elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the terrain beneath the figure composed of jagged, snow-covered rocks with realistic texture and shadowing, and does the figure rest securely on it without appearing suspended?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the terrain beneath the figure resembles snow-covered surfaces typical within a snow globe environment. The textures and shadows provide a realistic visual, and the figure appears to be securely placed atop the terrain, not giving the impression of suspension.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the wooden base have consistent wood texture, visible grain, and clearly defined runes that do not appear pixelated or digitally overlaid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base exhibits a consistent wood texture with visible grain, contributing to its realistic appearance. The runes on the base are well-defined and sharp, without signs of pixelation or poor overlay, maintaining a coherent design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the snow globe's surface smooth and transparent, with no visible seams or distortions that affect the internal elements' appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe's surface is depicted as smooth and transparent, providing an unobstructed view of the internal elements. No seams or distortions are apparent, ensuring visual clarity and fidelity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the chibi version of the figure’s face preserve the original’s blue eyes, white hair, and facial structure in a simplified but identifiable manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred face, an assessment cannot be made regarding the preservation of detailed facial features like blue eyes and specific facial structure. The visible white hair is consistent with the typical characteristics of chibi styling, yet the face features cannot be confirmed.",
