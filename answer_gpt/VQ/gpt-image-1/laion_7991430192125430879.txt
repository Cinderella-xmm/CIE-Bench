    "Question": "Q1: Does the translucent green LEGO brick construction of the bottle’s body maintain a consistent cylindrical form without visible warping or misalignment between bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is constructed with LEGO bricks that appear to be aligned in a consistent cylindrical shape. LEGO bricks are designed to interlock precisely, judging from the regular spacing and uniformity visible on the bottle's surface. There is no apparent warping or misalignment between bricks, as the cylindrical form appears smooth and uniform, indicative of a well-constructed LEGO model.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are all brand text elements (e.g., 'BACARDÍ', 'MOJITO') and logos clearly identifiable and properly aligned on the LEGO label, without distorted letterforms or missing characters?",
    "explanation": "The brand text elements on the LEGO label in Image B appear clear and properly aligned. LEGO designs often incorporate detailed decals or printed parts that maintain accurate character dimensions and alignment for readability and brand recognition. The text 'BACARDÍ' and 'MOJITO' are clearly identifiable with no distorted letterforms or missing characters observed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the blue LEGO cap accurately shaped as a cylinder with consistent height and diameter matching the original bottle’s neck, and does it feature a smooth, rounded top without angular breaks?",
    "explanation": "The blue cap in Image B is constructed using LEGO bricks, forming a cylindrical shape. LEGO bricks allow for consistent dimensions and smooth top surfaces when stacked properly, resulting in a rounded top without angular breaks. The cap matches the diameter of the original neck size proportionally, showcasing an accurate representation from a constructibility standpoint.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the white shelf beneath the LEGO bottle flat, horizontally aligned, and free from irregular edges or floating segments that suggest poor integration with the scene?",
    "explanation": "The shelf beneath the LEGO bottle in Image B is depicted as a flat surface, horizontally aligned with visible, straight edges. It appears free from irregularities, such as floating or misaligned segments, indicating well-integrated scene elements typical in 3D renderings or models constructed to simulate real-life setups accurately.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the smaller text elements such as 'natural mint flavor' and 'Simply pour over ice' fully visible and correctly spaced on the LEGO label, without overlapping or broken lettering?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the smaller text elements like 'natural mint flavor' and 'Simply pour over ice' are not visible in a legible form on the LEGO label, suggesting that smaller text may not have been included or represented due to spatial constraints or design simplicity in LEGO creations, which often overlook minute details seen on real-life labels.",
    "answer": "No"
