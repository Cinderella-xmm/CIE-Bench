      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the crystal horns on the dragon head proportionally sized relative to the mountain peak and do they exhibit natural refraction and transparency consistent with crystalline material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's horns are visually assessed for size and material characteristics relative to the mountain peak. The horns are large but consistent with fantasy depictions of dragons, where exaggerated features are typical. For crystalline material, refraction and transparency should be present, but the horns do not display clear transparency or refraction. Instead, they have a solid, more opaque appearance with light reflections. Thus, while size may be proportionally exaggerated intentionally, the lack of transparency and refraction suggests they don't mimic crystalline material properties.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ridge lines forming the dragon body show smooth, flowing transitions without abrupt angular bends or disproportionate thickness changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's body appears to wind smoothly across the landscape with ridge lines that transition evenly along the body, indicating careful design to maintain a natural, flowing appearance. There are no abrupt angular bends or sudden changes in thickness, which aligns with organic, naturalistic movement common to fantasy creatures depicted in a harmonious environment.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rocky scales and moss-covered spines distributed in a way that mimics natural erosion and plant growth patterns without repeating textures or uniform spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scales and spines on the dragon in Image B are distributed in a manner that resembles natural geological and botanical patterns. The varied placement and size of the scales and the organic growth of moss give a realistic impression of natural erosion and plant colonization, avoiding any obvious repetition or uniform spacing that would detract from the illusion of realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the dragon tail fade into the mist with a soft gradient, maintaining visibility of form through haze without sharp cutoffs or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon's tail in Image B tapers into the misty background with a smooth gradient transition. This effect maintains the visibility of the form softly through the haze, avoiding abrupt cutoffs or the creation of seemingly floating segments. This realistic fading effect is consistent with atmospheric perspective, where objects become less distinct as they recede into the fog.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dragon features align with the sun's position in the sky and match the lighting on surrounding mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows and highlights on the dragon are evaluated for consistency with existing environmental lighting. The sun appears to be positioned low in the sky, casting rays across the landscape. The lighting on the dragon's features is coherent with this light source, as the sunlit areas and shadows align with the light direction observed on the surrounding mountains, maintaining environmental consistency.",
