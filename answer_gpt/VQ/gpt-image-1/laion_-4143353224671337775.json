      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the beige and brown puzzle pieces uniformly aligned and interlocked across the surface of the sculpture without visible gaps, misalignments, or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the puzzle pieces are designed to give a smooth and continuous look across the sculpture. These pieces interlock naturally and smoothly, following the curve of the sculpture. There are no visible gaps or misalignments in the puzzle pattern, which suggests a well-executed interlocking design. This uniform alignment contributes to a cohesive aesthetic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the edges of the puzzle pieces follow the natural curvature of the original ceramic head shape without abrupt angular deviations or unnatural flattening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The puzzle pieces in Image B have been carefully designed to align with the organic curvature of the sculpture. The edges flow smoothly, respecting the original form of the piece, and there are no sharp angular deviations or unnatural flat areas that disrupt the original shape. This maintains the integrity and fluidity of the sculpture's outline.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the green puzzle fragment on the top of the head smooth and free of rough textures, cracks, or color variations that contrast with the surrounding beige and brown puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green puzzle piece on top of the sculpture in Image B is consistent in texture and color, maintaining a smooth surface without visible cracks or distinctive color variations that contrast dramatically with the surrounding pieces. It integrates seamlessly with the beige and brown puzzle pieces, contributing to a harmonious overall appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed horizontally on the white shelf with stable contact and no floating or tilting effects, maintaining a natural shadow and perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture rests on the white shelf with a stable and horizontal position. There are no signs of tilting or floating; the base of the sculpture makes consistent contact with the shelf surface, casting a natural shadow that is consistent with a properly aligned and placed object. This stable positioning ensures a realistic and well-proportioned perspective.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, eyebrows, mouth, ears) clearly preserved in shape and proportion despite being integrated into the puzzle piece design, without deformation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the puzzle theme present in Image B, the facial features such as eyes, eyebrows, and other facial elements are not explicitly visible due to the face being blurred. It suggests that integration into the puzzle design maintains clear demarcation and proportionality without any visible misalignment or distortion when viewed as intended.",
