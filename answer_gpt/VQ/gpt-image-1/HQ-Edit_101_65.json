      "question": "Does the transformed tapestry gown maintain continuous and coherent fabric folds and draping without visible seams or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tapestry gown in Image B appears to have smooth, flowing fabric with naturally appearing folds and draping that mimic how fabric naturally falls on a human body. The details such as patterns and texture maintain a logical continuity without visible seams or any sign of distorted geometry, indicating a realistic portrayal.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the platinum jewelry pieces (necklace, earrings, bangles) proportionally accurate and free from unnatural glares, misshapen forms, or inconsistent material textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jewelry in the edited image, including the necklace, earrings, and bangles, appears proportional to the overall figure and is well-integrated into the composition. The textures and material representations are consistent without any glaring mistakes like unnatural reflections or disproportions in form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the newly added elements in the background (stars, luminous flowers, lanterns) follow consistent lighting direction and depth cues without creating visual inconsistencies or floating objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements such as stars, luminous flowers, and lanterns in Image B seem to follow a consistent lighting scheme. They exhibit proper shadowing and light direction, which are coherent with one another and integrate well into the scene, ensuring there are no visually inconsistent or floating objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both hands correctly formed with five fingers each, natural joint alignment, and no overlapping or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands of the character display correctly formed fingers, each hand having five fingers. The fingers and joints appear naturally aligned without issues of overlapping or digit missing, thus maintaining anatomical correctness.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flowers and lanterns in the background of Image B show smooth gradients and soft glows that blend naturally into the scene. There are no jagged edges or artificial halos around these elements, which suggests high-quality rendering and attention to detail.",
