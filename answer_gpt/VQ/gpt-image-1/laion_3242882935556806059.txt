    "Question": "Q1: Are the petal shapes preserved with jagged crystal facets that follow the natural curvature of the original lily petals, without visible warping or geometric breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal petals display jagged facets that emulate the natural curvature and shape of lily petals. This arrangement avoids geometric breaks and maintains a continuous, smooth curve that resembles the overall contour of the original lily petals. The facets are designed to create visual interest while preserving the petal's essence typical of a lily in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the glass rods extend naturally from the vase upward, matching the number and spacing of the original stems, without appearing disconnected or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "The glass rods in Image B are numerous and extend uniformly from the vase upward, much like the original stems in Image A. They are aligned correctly in terms of spacing and direction, creating a coherent visual effect without any apparent misalignment or disconnect. The design maintains consistency with the original image's stems in terms of density and arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the black marble surface beneath the vase smooth, uniformly dark, and reflective, with shadows and highlights consistent with the light source and object placement?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a black marble surface with a consistent dark tone. It appears smooth and reflective, capturing reflections and light highlights that match the position of the vase and the light source. These reflections and shadows are consistent with how light interacts with a typical marble surface, indicating an understanding of lighting and positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Do the crystal petals exhibit subtle variations in amber hue and transparency, with internal light refractions and depth cues that suggest volume and translucency?",
    "explanation": "The crystal petals in Image B show varying amber hues and levels of transparency, creating an intricate play of light and shadows within the petals. These visual effects, including internal refractions and depth cues, suggest volume and translucency, resembling how real crystals interact with light. These variations add realism and visual dimension to the petals.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the glass rods enter the water at angles consistent with refraction, showing slight bending at the waterline, and remain submerged without floating or disappearing mid-length?",
    "explanation": "The glass rods in Image B are depicted entering the water at angles that visually demonstrate refraction effects, causing minor bending at the waterline. They remain submerged throughout their length, consistent with how real glass rods would appear in water, without floating above or abruptly disappearing mid-length.",
    "answer": "Yes"
