      "question": "Are the lockers in the background seamlessly replaced with mid-century modern showroom elements without visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lockers from Image A are replaced with elements typical of a mid-century modern showroom, such as large windows, a clear sky, and buildings in the background. The integration appears smooth without any visible artifacts or textures that would be considered unnatural. This suggests a seamless transition from the locker room background to a showroom setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jersey display from Image A has been replaced with a luxurious piece of designer furniture, notably a mid-century modern sofa.

      "question": "Do the characters' gestures and body language remain natural and consistent with the new showroom setting and the luxurious furniture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the change of setting and props from the locker room to a showroom with luxurious furniture, the characters' gestures and body language in Image B remain coherent. The hand gestures of the character in a suit suggest discussion or presentation, which fits naturally within a showroom context, maintaining consistent interaction with the setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to be consistent with what one would expect in a well-lit showroom, with the presence of window light indicating daytime. The shadows and lighting on the furniture and characters align with this source of light, not introducing any discordant or unnatural effects compared to Image A's setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the transition from Image A to Image B, the characters and what they are wearing remain unchanged. The outfits, including the suit and sportswear, are consistent across both images. The primary changes are to the background and the object being displayed, while the characters themselves are consistent.",
