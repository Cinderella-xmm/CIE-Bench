        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold foiling in Image B is applied consistently on the tree-shaped box, displaying a uniform reflectivity that matches high-quality printing techniques often used for luxury packaging.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nut embellishments in Image B are positioned in a manner that appears natural within the packaging. The nuts seem to be set into designated sections within the chocolate box, reflecting careful placement. The shadows and depth are correctly portrayed, likely achieved through the well-lit photograph, preventing any floating appearance. This suggests a realistic presentation where each nut is appropriately embedded in its spot.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a photo of a chocolate box without any visible sparkle effects. The visual effects are likely achieved naturally through reflection, rather than added sparkle effects. This absence of artificial sparkle effects maintains the authenticity of the product's appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which features a tree-shaped chocolate box, the concept of 'tiers' pertains to the alignment and distribution of sections within the packaging design. Here, the inner sections are evenly spaced and aligned to create a neat, organized look that mimics the structure of a tree. The overall conical shape of the tree is preserved, maintaining symmetry and avoiding any visual distortion.",
