      "question": "Does the floral pattern on the suit jacket follow the contours of the lapels and shoulders without visible distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral pattern on the suit jacket is analyzed by observing how the design aligns with the natural shape of the jacket, including the lapels and shoulders. The pattern appears to follow the contours smoothly, displaying no significant distortion or misalignment despite the complexity of the floral design. This suggests a successful integration of the pattern with the contours of the garment.",

      "question": "Is the geometric design on the bow tie aligned symmetrically and properly tied under the collar without breaking the knot shape or introducing sharp, artificial edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric design on the bow tie can be evaluated by observing its symmetry and alignment under the collar. The bow tie's pattern appears well-balanced on both sides, maintaining a symmetrical shape. There are no sharp, artificial edges that would suggest improper tying or design flaws. This symmetry and neat appearance indicate a well-designed bow tie.",

      "question": "Is the dotted texture in the background evenly spaced and consistent in size and density throughout, without overlapping or obscuring the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background's dotted texture should be assessed for uniformity and whether it intrudes upon the subject. The dots appear evenly spaced and consistent in size and density, maintaining a uniform appearance across the background. No areas show visible overlap either with each other or encroaching on the subject's figure, suggesting a well-managed background design.",

      "question": "Are the facial features, including the eyes, nose, and mouth, proportionally correct and undistorted, with natural skin texture and shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B are obscured, so the proportionality, skin texture, and shading cannot be accurately assessed due to the blurring applied. Therefore, this question is not applicable to the conditions provided.",

      "question": "Do the floral suit and graphic bow tie exhibit consistent lighting and shadowing relative to the shirt and background, without unnatural highlights or flat areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I analyze the lighting and shadowing on the floral suit and bow tie in comparison to the shirt and background. The colors and patterns including the suit and bow tie appear vibrant, while the lighting and shadows across these elements do not display any unnatural highlights or flat areas. There is a seeming consistency of lighting across the various components which suggests an intentional design that avoids jarring interruptions in light and shadow.",
