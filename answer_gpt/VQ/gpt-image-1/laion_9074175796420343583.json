    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the arms and face drawn on the pie’s surface consistent with the texture and color of the crust, without visible digital artifacts or mismatched shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie is personified with facial features and arms. The texture and color of the face and arms match the pie's crust, and they don't exhibit any digital artifacts or mismatched shading. This consistency indicates a well-integrated design where the new elements blend smoothly with the original pie texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lattice pattern retain its original grid structure and spacing, and does it appear as a draped fabric apron without broken or stretched lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie has a lattice pattern on top that doubles as a stylistic feature resembling a draped fabric apron. The structure and spacing of the lattice remain consistent without stretching or breaking lines, supporting the visual illusion of the pie wearing an apron.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the knife converted into a feather pen with a realistic quill tip and wooden shaft, and does it maintain a natural transition from the original knife shape without abrupt edges or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a feather pen in the pie's hand instead of a knife. The pen features a realistic quill tip and a wooden shaft, which blends naturally from the shape of the original knife. The transition from the metallic knife structure to the organic form of a feather quill is smooth, without abrupt edges or mismatched textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the additional pastries positioned at a consistent distance and scale relative to the main pie, and do they cast realistic shadows and reflect the same lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, additional pastries like bread and cupcakes accompany the pie character. These pastries are consistently scaled in relation to the pie and are positioned at distances that maintain compositional balance. The shadows they cast align with the light source direction seen on the pie, contributing to the overall coherence of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the text bubbles positioned close to the pie’s mouth, legible, and free from overlapping or clipping with the pie or plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, speech bubbles are incorporated to give the pie character dialogue. These bubbles are positioned near the mouth of the pie, ensuring legibility and comprehension. They are placed without overlapping any main features of the pie or the accompanying plate, maintaining a clean presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the hands on the pie have exactly five fingers each, proper joint alignment, and a natural grip on the feather pen without deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie character features anthropomorphized hands gripping a feather pen. These hands have a standard anatomical structure with five fingers each. The fingers are appropriately jointed and aligned, allowing for a natural grip on the pen, and do not exhibit any extra digits or unusual deformations.",
