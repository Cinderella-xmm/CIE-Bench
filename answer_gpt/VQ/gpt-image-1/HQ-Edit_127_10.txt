    "Question": "Q1: Are the upper and lower tiers clearly defined with consistent perspective and proportional scaling, and is there a visible separation between them that suggests a layered structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe has a clear separation between the upper and lower tiers. The upper tier is within the glass globe, featuring the Eiffel Tower and surrounding buildings. The lower tier is the base that displays another depiction of the Eiffel Tower and the surrounding gardens. The clear delineation between the glass globe and the base contributes to a layered structure. The perspectives are consistent and well-scaled between the two tiers, indicating a cohesive design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the buildings in the upper tier have a metallic sheen with subtle reflections and gradients that match the lighting direction, and are there no flat or unnaturally uniform color patches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the upper tier inside the snow globe shows the Eiffel Tower and surrounding buildings with a metallic finish that suggests a sheen. The lighting appears to create natural reflections and gradients, enhancing the three-dimensionality and avoiding any flat or unnatural color patches.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the trees and bushes in the lower tier composed of irregular, naturally shaped forms with varying heights and densities, and do they lack repeating texture tiles or unnatural symmetry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction on the base shows trees and bushes that appear to have irregular shapes and natural forms. The varying heights and densities of the foliage contribute to a realistic portrayal. There is no evidence of repeating texture tiles or unnatural symmetry, making the garden scene appear authentic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the silvery flakes distributed across the space between tiers with soft edges, slight blurring, and depth-based opacity, indicating movement through air?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe contains silvery flakes that appear to be dotted throughout the space inside the globe. These flakes show characteristics of being soft-edged, slightly blurred, and having opacity variations that suggest depth, simulating movement through air as if they're snowflakes falling.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the base show individually rendered cobblestones with visible grout lines and surface variations, and are the street lamps proportionally sized and evenly spaced along the path?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base does not focus on individually rendered cobblestones with visible grout lines; instead, the representation is more stylized and does not depict such detailed surface variations. The street lamps are present but their proportionality and even spacing arenâ€™t distinctly evident as the focus is more illustrative rather than hyper-detailed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are both Eiffel Towers structurally intact with correct lattice patterns, uniform scaling, and no stretched or compressed sections that deviate from their known design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower within the snow globe and the depiction on the base are structurally intact. They feature the correct lattice patterns that are well-known in the design of the Eiffel Tower. They are uniformly scaled and do not show signs of being stretched or compressed, maintaining the integrity of the well-known architectural icon.",
    "answer": "Yes"
