      "question": "Does the fireplace appear naturally integrated into the medieval castle hall setting without any visible unnatural textures or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fireplace has a gothic architectural design with pointed arches, stone texture, and carvings that align with common medieval castle features. The stone texture appears consistent, and there are no obvious irregular shapes or textures that disrupt its integration into the hall. By common sense, a medieval castle would typically have a stone fireplace as part of its structure, and the visuals in Image B support this expectation without visible flaws.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the stone carvings that replace the bookshelves exhibit realistic stone textures and colors, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone carvings exhibit a consistent stone texture that aligns with the walls and columns typical of medieval architecture. The limestone-like coloration is appropriate, and the carvings do not show any obvious distortions or artifacts. By referencing common stonework used in historical structures, the textures and colors appear natural with respect to the setting.",

      "question": "Are the sofas and table adequately adapted or replaced to fit the medieval hall setting, maintaining structural coherence and visual credibility in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sofas and table in Image B are consistent with traditional designs that could exist in a grand setting, with neutral colors and classical forms that blend into the medieval aesthetic. They do not exhibit any modern elements that would clash with the setting. While they may not be explicitly medieval, they are structurally coherent with the regality of a castle hall and visually credible in such a setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the lighting consistent with a medieval castle hall setting, with no unnatural shadows or light effects disrupting the scene's authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows warm, consistent lighting from both the fireplace and wall sconces common in medieval settings. The light creates soft shadows and highlights the stone details without any stark contrasts or unnatural lighting features. Given typical castle lighting, with candles and fireplaces as primary sources, the lighting aligns with expected historical ambiance without disruption.",

      "question": "Does the rug maintain its intricate pattern and texture while fitting seamlessly into the medieval castle hall environment without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rug in Image B maintains a rich, intricate pattern appropriate for the grandeur of a castle hall setting. While not explicitly medieval in design, its integration with the surrounding stone textures and color palettes ensures it does not stand out as incongruous. Historical rugs often featured complex patterns and the choice here supports the cohesive elegance of the space.",
