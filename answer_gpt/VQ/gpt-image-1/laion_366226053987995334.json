      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) on the feather earrings proportionally sized and seamlessly integrated into the feather surface without distorting the engraved lines or creating unnatural texture contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feather earrings have been anthropomorphized with faces, including eyes and mouths. The facial features are proportionally sized to the overall size of the earrings and are designed in a cartoonish style that fits well with the feathers' surfaces. The placement of these features does not appear to distort the overall shape of the earrings or create significant unnatural texture contrasts. The features are integrated in such a way that they complement the existing feather design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central black oval stone on each feather preserved and unobscured by the added facial features, and do the engraved lines of the feather remain symmetrical and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central black oval stone is visible on each of the feather earrings. The addition of facial features does not obstruct this central stone. Moreover, the engraved lines of the feathers remain clear, symmetrical, and undistorted by the added cartoonish elements, suggesting that the integration of these features has been done thoughtfully to preserve the earrings' original design elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a visible and logically connected arm-like extension from one earring to the other, suggesting motion, and are both earrings still properly attached to their hooks without floating or detachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible arm-like extensions depicted on the earrings, suggesting an anthropomorphic form with motion as one earring appears to be pulling the other along. Both earrings retain their original hook attachments visually; however, the scene's animation aspect creates an illusion of them being figures in motion rather than static earrings. Despite the motion depiction, they do not appear to be floating or detached from their hooks in a traditional sense.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text bubble positioned near the head of the anthropomorphic earring, clearly legible, and free from overlapping or covering essential details of the earrings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a text bubble is placed above the anthropomorphic earrings. The bubble is positioned near what could be considered the 'head' of one of the earrings if it were a cartoon character. The text within the bubble is clear and legible, with the bubble designed to avoid overlapping or covering any essential visual details of the earrings themselves, thus maintaining the clarity of both the image and the message within the text.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bold outlines follow the exact contours of the earrings without gaps or misalignment, and are the vibrant colors applied consistently without pixelation, blurring, or loss of fine engraved details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, bold outlines have been used to enhance the cartoonish style of the earrings, following the contours accurately without apparent gaps or misalignments. The vibrant colors used across the image are applied consistently and smoothly, without any noticeable pixelation or blurring, maintaining a coherent style without compromising the engraved details of the original feather design, showcasing a transformation from a realistic to a stylized depiction.",
