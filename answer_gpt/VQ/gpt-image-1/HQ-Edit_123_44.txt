    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass display case surrounding the aircraft have smooth, clear surfaces without visible distortion, scratches, or unnatural reflections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case features smooth and clear surfaces that reveal a clean and well-defined appearance. The transparency is uniform without any distortion or scratches, and the reflections or light interaction appear natural. This is assessed by examining the clarity of how the aircraft and clouds are visible through the glass and the way light interacts with the glass surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the leather accents and brass corners attached to the display case with accurate material textures, proper lighting response, and no visible seams or floating effects?",
    "explanation": "The examination of Image B shows leather accents and brass corners that exhibit realistic texture and proper lighting response. The materials have detailed surface textures that mimic real leather and brass, and there are no visible seams or misalignments. The attachment appears natural without any floating effects, derived from the consistent shadowing and the leather's stitched edges.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the engraved emblem on the front of the display case clearly defined with appropriate depth and shadowing, and does it blend naturally into the glass surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the emblem is visible with distinct engravings that exhibit depth and appropriate shadowing, lending to a three-dimensional appearance. It is mounted onto the glass case with well-integrated seams or attachments. The analysis is based on the observed shading and the blending of the emblem in context to the surrounding materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the miniature clouds positioned inside the glass case, visually separated from the aircraft, and rendered with soft, volumetric textures without clipping or unnatural transparency?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows miniature clouds that have soft, volumetric textures, suggesting a fluffy appearance typical of clouds. They are placed in the case without intersecting with the aircraft, maintaining clear separation. The transparency and lighting on the clouds are consistent and natural, with no evidence of clipping against the glass or reflections.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the propellers depicted with rotational motion blur and properly aligned with the engine nacelles, without deformation or clipping against the display case?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the propellers are shown with a subtle rotational motion blur to indicate movement, while being correctly aligned with the engine nacelles. There are no visible signs of deformation or clipping against the display case, suggesting a well-executed design that respects spatial constraints, verified by the accurate positioning and absence of overlap with the glass boundary.",
    "answer": "Yes"
