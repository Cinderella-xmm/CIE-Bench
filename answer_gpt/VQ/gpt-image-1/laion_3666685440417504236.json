      "question": "Are the dome, minaret, and arches inside the globe proportionally accurate and geometrically intact, with no warped edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dome, minaret, and arches inside the globe appear proportionally accurate and geometrically intact. The model is cleanly constructed, with no evident warped edges or broken lines. This can be inferred from the smooth lines and coherent shapes that represent each architectural element. Common sense indicates that skilled model-making ensures these details are maintained for visual appeal and accuracy.",

      "question": "Do the palm trees and cobblestone path inside the globe appear at a consistent scale with the architecture and follow a plausible layout leading to the entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees and cobblestone path inside the globe are at a consistent scale with the architectural model. The palm trees are proportionate to the entrance, not overwhelmingly large or small, and the path logically leads to the entrance of the architectural structure, suggesting thoughtful planning of layout. This design choice mirrors common practices in miniature model making to maintain a realistic representation.",

      "question": "Are the Persian patterns on the exterior of the globe continuous, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the tilework seen on the original building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Persian patterns on the exterior of the globe appear continuous, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with those seen in traditional Persian architectural designs. These designs reflect the ornate tilework found in historical structures, recognized for their symmetrical and repetitive floral motifs, ensuring stylistic authenticity. Comparing with Image A would reveal similar intricate designs characteristic of Persian architecture.",

      "question": "Are the golden highlights on the dome and arches applied in a way that follows natural light interaction, with no flat, overly bright, or artificially drawn lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden highlights on the dome and arches are delicately applied, enhancing their structural features without appearing flat, overly bright, or artificially drawn. This application mirrors natural light interaction, adding depth and realism to the model. Understanding light dynamics and artistic skills both contribute to assessing these highlights appropriately.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the boundary between the interior scene and the globeâ€™s surface clean and free of jagged edges, transparency glitches, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boundary between the interior scene and the globe's surface is seamlessly integrated, with no jagged edges, transparency glitches, or unnatural reflections visible. The craftsmanship of the model ensures this smooth transition, drawing upon skills in digital rendering or physical modeling to achieve clean lines and boundaries.",
