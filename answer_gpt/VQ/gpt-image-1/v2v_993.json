      "question": "Does the chibi character maintain the same pose and clothing details as the original image without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the chibi character mimics the same pose as in the original image, with arms raised and legs positioned as if in a martial arts stance. The clothing, a black top and pants, is consistent with the original image. However, the body proportions have been altered to fit the chibi style, which characteristically features exaggerated head size and smaller, rounder limbs. This means while the pose is similar, the style introduces intentional distortions typical of chibi art, differentiating it from the original image's realistic proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and fine details of the chibi character's clothing and skin natural and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textures in the chibi character are simplified in accordance with chibi style, which typically lacks the detailed textures found in more realistic depictions. The clothing and skin are uniformly smooth and lack the fabric details or skin texture seen in the original image, signifying a consistent adherence to a more cartoonish aesthetic rather than realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi character's hands and legs match the original image without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi style inherently involves a significant deviation from realistic proportions, focusing on exaggeration like larger heads and smaller limbs. Therefore, while the pose is similar, the character's hands and legs are proportionately smaller and rounder compared to the realistic representation in the original image. This is a stylistic choice rather than distortion in error.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the placement of the chibi character sitting on the edge of the Instagram frame look natural and visually plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the chibi character is designed to emerge from an Instagram-like frame, which gives an illusion of interaction with the environment. The way the character is positioned on the edge of the frame suggests they are popping out of the frame, fitting well within the stylistic choice of a digital animation world where characters often interact with digital elements creatively.",

      "question": "Are the social media icons and the username \"Graceful\" integrated seamlessly into the scene without disrupting the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The social media icons and the username 'Graceful' are incorporated into the scene as part of a digital frame meant to mimic a social media post. They are placed logically around the frame, consistent with typical digital interfaces. The integration of these elements supports the thematic unity of the scene rather than causing visual disturbance.",
