    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the metallic statue have five fingers on each hand, with natural joint angles and smooth surface transitions, and no visible seams or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue in Image B appears to be meticulously designed with attention to detail, showing smooth transitions and natural joint angles. The fingers are well-defined and appear to fit naturally within the structure of the hands. There are no visible seams or geometric distortions, suggesting that the artist aimed for a realistic and polished look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leaves of the miniature trees semi-transparent, allowing light to pass through them, and positioned at a distance from the statue that matches their reduced scale without overlapping the figure unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature trees have a delicate appearance, with leaves that appear slightly translucent, suggesting that they are semi-transparent to some extent. They are positioned carefully to maintain a proper scale relative to the statue, and do not overlap it unnaturally, which indicates a thoughtful consideration of spatial arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the engraved plaques flush with the base surface, with readable text and consistent depth, and do they follow the contour of the pedestal without appearing detached or warped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The engraved plaques on the pedestal in Image B are flush with the surface, appearing integrated rather than detached. The engraving has a consistent depth, and the text, though stylized, seems to follow the contour of the base naturally without any signs of warping or detachment.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the glass dome fully transparent with smooth, continuous curvature, showing accurate reflections of nearby objects and sky, and free from jagged edges or internal distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B displays a transparent, smooth surface with continuous curvature. It accurately reflects light and nearby objects, maintaining clarity and transparency without jagged edges or distortions. This indicates high attention to detail in rendering the dome.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dome stand feature a polished stone surface with subtle texture variation, and are the vine patterns clearly defined, following natural growth patterns without breaking or repeating unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dome stand presents a polished stone appearance with subtle texture variation. The vine patterns are intricately carved and follow natural growth patterns, seamlessly integrated into the design without any abrupt breaks or uniform repetitions.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the glass dome positioned above the statue and base without clipping through any part of the figure or pedestal, and does it rest securely on the dome stand without floating or tilting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B is correctly positioned above the statue and base, aligning accurately and resting securely on the dome stand. No parts of the figure or pedestal intersect with the dome, and it remains upright without any floating or tilting, demonstrating careful placement and stability.",
