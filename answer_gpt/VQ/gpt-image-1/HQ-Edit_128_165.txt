    "Question": "Q1: Does the bell-shaped body of the jellyfish have a consistent translucent appearance with no sharp edges, visible seams, or unnatural texture patches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the jellyfish's bell exhibits a uniform translucent appearance. The image depicts the jellyfish with smooth, flowing lines that contribute to its natural look. There are no signs of sharp edges or seams; the texture is continuous and consistent across the surface of the jellyfish. The use of a gradient and the absence of harsh transitions suggest a well-rendered translucent effect, common in depictions of jellyfish to show their soft, delicate nature.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the tendrils extending from the jellyfish's body smooth, curved, and iridescent, with no angular distortions or segmented appearances?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the jellyfish's tendrils appear smooth and naturally curved. They flow in a gentle manner, indicative of a fluid underwater setting. The tendrils are illustrated with fine lines that mimic the nature of jellyfish appendages which move gracefully in water. There are no angular distortions or segments that would disrupt the natural flowing appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the internal glowing patterns within the jellyfish's bell appear as natural, swirling bioluminescent designs without repeating geometric shapes or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing patterns within the jellyfish's bell are depicted as swirling, intricate designs. They echo the bioluminescent qualities often seen in jellyfish where light emanates from within. The patterns flow seamlessly without repetitive geometric shapes or jagged edges, indicating a design approach that respects nature's often complex and non-repeatable forms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the glowing nodules along the tendrils softly illuminated with gradual light spread and positioned in a natural, non-uniform but plausible arrangement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing nodules along the jellyfish's tendrils are depicted with a soft illumination that gradually spreads out. The placement of these nodules is organic and non-uniform, mimicking how bioluminescence might appear in a real jellyfish. There is no strict pattern, emphasizing a natural underwater presence where light interacts with water currents dynamically.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the ambient lighting in the scene diffused and tinted with blue-green hues, and are there faint water particles or depth cues visible around the jellyfish, consistent with an underwater environment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ambient lighting is diffused and carries a strong blue hue, which is characteristic of underwater scenes. This choice in lighting supports the perception of depth and immerses the viewer in the aquatic setting. There are subtle visual elements such as faint particles that suggest the presence of water, reinforcing the jellyfish's natural habitat.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the connection point between the jellyfish and the ceiling smooth and continuous, with no floating segments or abrupt breaks in structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no ceiling present. Jellyfish are typically depicted as free-floating in aquatic scenes without physical attachments to ceilings. Therefore, the notion of a connection point in such a depiction does not apply. The jellyfish's structure appears organic and continuous without hanging segments or breaks, consistent with natural jellyfish.",
    "answer": "No"
