      "question": "Do the feathers exhibit smooth, continuous gradients of fiery coloration without visible banding, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays feathers with smooth transitions between vibrant blue, orange, and red hues. The fiery gradients on the rooster's feathers present a high-quality digital illustration without any abrupt changes or pixelated appearance. This is achieved through skillful blending and shading techniques commonly used in digital art to simulate realistic textures and lighting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the tail smoothly transform into smoke-like tendrils without abrupt cutoffs or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rooster's tail in Image B extends into smoke-like tendrils with smooth and flowing lines that naturally interconnect with each other. The artist integrated these tendrils seamlessly into the illustration without any visible cutoffs or awkward transitions, showing a mastery of creating elements that appear naturally cohesive due to fluid motion and digital painting skills.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the molten gold accents seamlessly blended into the wing and crest surfaces, showing depth and reflection consistent with metallic material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the molten gold accents on the wing and crest surfaces are subtly integrated, showing gradient shading and highlights that convey a metallic sheen. This technique suggests depth and reflective qualities typical of polished metal, achieved through precise color application and understanding of light behaviors in digital artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the flame-like eyes maintain the original eye shape and size, with no distortion of the surrounding facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flame-like eyes in Image B are designed as vibrant, glowing features, yet the artist has managed to maintain a shape and size consistent with realistic rooster anatomy. The facial features around the eye, such as the comb and wattle, are unaffected by distortion, showing the artist's ability to incorporate fantasy elements without disrupting anatomical accuracy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the rune patterns clearly visible but not oversized or warped, preserving the natural shape and texture of the talons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rune patterns on the rooster's talons are visible, with fine linework ensuring clarity. Despite their intricate design, they maintain proportionality with the talons, avoiding oversizing or warping. This retains the talons' natural texture and appearance, exhibiting the artist's skill in positioning detailed elements harmoniously.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the rooster’s body posture and limb alignment preserved, with no stretching, compression, or misplacement of limbs relative to the torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B captures the rooster with limbs and body posture in a natural and anatomically correct alignment. The stance is consistent with the rooster's typical posture, and there is no evidence of stretching or compression distorting the limb placement. The cohesive design underscores the attention to anatomical correctness amidst the introduction of artistic embellishments.",
