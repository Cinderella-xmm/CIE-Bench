      ],

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the mural elements blend seamlessly with the existing architectural features (such as windows, walls, and flooring) without breaking continuity or creating visual inconsistencies in depth or scale?",
      "choices": [

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cultural artifacts like lamps appear as part of the mural art rather than physical objects. These elements follow the artistic style of the image without needing spatial accuracy since they are not physically interacting with light or casting shadows.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of hands in Image B is partially obscure due to the angle and cultural art style. However, there are no visible errors in anatomy such as extra digits or malformed shapes, indicating that the illustration follows a natural representation.",
