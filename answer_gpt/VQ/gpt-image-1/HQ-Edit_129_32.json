      "question": "Does the velvet lining inside the box display a soft, matte texture with subtle pile variation and appropriate shadowing beneath the key, indicating realistic fabric behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the velvet compartment inside the box appears to have a soft, matte texture with subtle pile variation. The shadowing beneath the key gives an impression of depth and adds a realistic dimension to the fabric behavior. The visual cues suggest typical characteristics of velvet, a fabric known for its soft texture and light-absorbing properties that result in matte appearances. This analysis evidently points to the texture behaving as expected for velvet lining.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gold scrollwork patterns on the lid continuous, symmetrical, and proportionally similar to the decorative elements on the key’s bow, without any jagged edges or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the gold scrollwork on the lid appears continuous and symmetrical. The patterns align well proportionally with the decorative elements on the key’s bow. The visual information shows smooth curves without any jagged edges or segmentation issues. These patterns are consistent with ornate scrollwork designs that typically emphasize symmetry and fluidity, which is adequately represented in this image.",

      "question": "Is the satin compartment visibly smooth with soft highlights and gentle folds, and does the key sit flush within it without gaps or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the satin compartment is depicted with smooth surfaces, soft highlights, and gentle folds that are typical of satin’s light-reflecting characteristics. The key is positioned within the satin compartment without apparent gaps or appearing to float. The interaction between the satin's surface and the key suggests the key is resting naturally within the compartment, adhering to the physical behavior of satin fabric.",

      "question": "Is the embossed text “Eternal Elegance” clearly legible, evenly raised, and rendered with a metallic luster that matches the gold tone and reflectivity of the key and scrollwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The embossed text “Eternal Elegance” in Image B is clearly legible and demonstrates an evenly raised profile. The metallic luster of the text matches the gold tone and reflectivity seen in the key and scrollwork. This consistency in reflectivity and tone suggests a unified design approach and quality craftsmanship. The visual cues confirm the text features similar metallic properties, enhancing the overall elegance.",
