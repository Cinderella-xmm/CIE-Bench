    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the crystal orb surrounding the castle have clean, unbroken edges without visible distortion or bending of the castleâ€™s structure inside it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a castle inside a crystal orb. The orb's edges are smooth and well-defined, as evident by the consistent and circular outline encapsulating the scene inside. The castle inside maintains its proportions, with no evident warping that might result from lens or perspective distortion. This conclusion is reached by observing the clear boundaries and the symmetry of the orb.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the clouds positioned above the castle without overlapping or clipping through any architectural elements, and do they have soft, natural-looking edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are placed in the background above the castle structure within the orb. They do not interfere or intersect with the castle's architecture, maintaining separation that imitates natural position in the sky. The cloud edges are smooth, giving the appearance of natural clouds blended with the background.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vines climb the castle walls from the bottom upward, following the wall contours without breaking the stone texture or appearing to float in mid-air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Closer inspection of Image B reveals vines clinging to the castle surfaces. The vines appear organically attached to the walls, stemming from the base and climbing upwards, respecting the structural contours. They integrate with the texture of the stone, showing no signs of floating or overshadowing the wall textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gem-like flowers placed within the garden beds at a natural scale, with no excessive glare or repeating textures that indicate artificial rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flowers in Image B are positioned around the base of the castle inside the orb. They are of varied sizes and colors, seemingly growing from the depicted garden beds. Their scale relative to the castle is consistent with natural proportions, and the rendering shows no repetitive patterns or glares that would suggest artificial manipulations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dragon positioned on a stable part of the central tower, proportionally small compared to the structure, and casting a shadow aligned with the ambient light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A dragon is placed on the central tower of the castle in Image B. It appears small compared to the overall castle size, which aligns with the typical small stature of decorative elements. The dragon looks securely positioned without exceeding the structural limits of the tower. However, there is no visible shadow cast by the dragon which could be inconsistent with ambient light considerations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the gold base lie flush with the ground, extend evenly under the castle, and show consistent engraved patterns without jagged edges or texture errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold base in Image B supports the orb. It appears to lie flat and evenly beneath the globe, seamlessly extending under the whole scene it supports. The engraving patterns are consistent and smooth, showing no jaggedness or texture artefacts, indicating high-quality rendering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all added elements (orb, clouds, vines, dragon, flowers, base) structurally coherent with the original castle, showing no broken lines, floating components, or conflicting lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, elements such as the orb, clouds, vines, flowers, and base appear well-integrated into the scene, with consistent edges and style. However, the dragon does not show an appropriate shadow, which creates a minor lighting inconsistency that suggests slight incoherence in the integration of light and shadow among elements.",
