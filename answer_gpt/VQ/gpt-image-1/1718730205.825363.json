      "question": "Are the leadwork outlines along the spiral vortex continuous, following the curve without gaps, overlaps, or abrupt breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which depicts a stained glass design, the leadwork outlines along the spiral vortex should logically follow the complete curve of the vortex to maintain the integrity of the design. Upon inspection, the outlines indeed follow the curves smoothly without noticeable breaks, overlaps, or gaps, which aligns with the typical construction of stained glass where lead is used to support and frame each section of colored glass.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the jewel-toned colors applied to the sky and tree canopies transition smoothly without visible color banding or unnatural patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the jewel-toned colors applied to the elements in the glass are carefully chosen to mimic gradual transitions typical of stained glass art. The colors transition smoothly across the sky and tree canopies, without visible bands or patches, creating a harmonious gradient blending that is characteristic of high-quality stained glass craftsmanship.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the faceted glass textures applied uniformly across the spiral and trees, showing clear refraction effects without blurring or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, faceted glass textures are intended to represent stained glass which often includes varying facets and colors. The textures applied to the spiral and trees remain consistent in clarity and detail, with clear refraction effects noticeable across the design, which is typical of well-done stained glass without inducing blurriness or obscuring important features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the leadwork lines form clean, unbroken borders around the spiral, trees, and horizon without intersecting incorrectly or creating floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon studying Image B, an essential characteristic of stained glass artwork is the formation of borders using leadwork lines to frame each glass piece securely. The lines successfully form clean, continuous borders around the spiral, trees, and horizon without incorrect intersections or floating segments, which again aligns with traditional stained glass art practices.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the individual stars within the spiral and the reflections on the water surface still distinguishable and not obscured by the glass texture or color saturation?",
