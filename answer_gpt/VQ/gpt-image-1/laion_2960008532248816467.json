      "question": "Are the eyes and smile drawn on the yellow surface of the front tart smooth, consistent in color with the surrounding custard, and free from jagged edges or unnatural texture disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and smile on the tart are part of an illustration style that is smooth and integrated into the yellow custard surface. The facial features are consistent in color with the custard, with no noticeable interruptions or disruptions in texture, which reflects a uniform and professionally illustrated design typical of animated or playful character renderings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the forest creatures on the crust rim appear proportionally small, properly aligned with the curve of the crust, and have soft, coherent textures without visible pixelation or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creatures on the crust of the tart in Image B are designed within an animated style, which entails small, cute, and proportionally appropriate figures that align with the curvature of the crust. Their textures appear soft and cohesive, matching the seamless and smooth illustration style without any visible pixelation or artifact issues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the swirling path extend smoothly from the base of the front tart into the background, with consistent shading and perspective, and without sharp edges or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swirling path extends from the front tart, smoothly transitioning into the background. The path maintains a consistent shading and perspective that matches the overall whimsical and illustrative theme of the image. There are no apparent disruptions such as sharp edges or segments that seem detached or floating.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the green foliage and pastel flowers positioned around the tart at a realistic distance, with proper shadowing and no overlapping or clipping onto the tartâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green foliage and pastel flowers in Image B surround the tart in a manner that is consistent with its playful and cartoonish design. They are positioned at a suitable distance that allows the elements to coexist harmoniously without overlapping issues or apparent clipping into the tart's form. Shadowing, while softened by the illustration style, is applied in a way that complements the scene.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the two tarts retain their original shape, size, and layered structure (crust, custard, top glaze), with only non-destructive additions applied, and are there no distortions such as warped edges or missing layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only one tart is illustrated, and not in the original realistic style but rather in an animated, character-like form. Due to the nature of the illustrative changes, the shape, size, and details differ from the original realistic structure seen in Image A. The focus has shifted from maintaining the original attributes to creating a new, altered design with character traits, rather than simply adding features non-destructively.",
