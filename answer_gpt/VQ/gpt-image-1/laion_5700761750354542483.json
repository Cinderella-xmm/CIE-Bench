      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the embroidered patterns on the butterfly’s wings and body aligned with the original gemstone positions and do they display consistent thread density and color without visible breaks or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the embroidered patterns on the butterfly's wings and body replicate the arrangement of gemstones from Image A. The embroidery on Image B reflects a well-crafted approach, with a consistent thread density and the use of blue and gold colors similar to Image A's gemstones. The colors align well without breaks or misalignments in the embroidery, showing a precise and thoughtful design. In Image A, the gemstones are placed in a structured pattern with blue and white colors and seen under bright reflections. Image B successfully translates these elements into embroidery, ensuring alignment and consistency in thread work.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the butterfly’s body and frame appear made of soft fabric with no visible metallic shine or rigid edges, and does it show natural fabric folds or drape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly appears to be made of soft, plush fabric, lacking metallic shine or rigid edges. The body has a plush, rounded texture rather than the hardness seen in the metallic butterfly of Image A. There are natural fabric folds and draping, suggesting softness and flexibility absent in the rigid metal construction of Image A, which features a shiny, smooth metallic surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wing surfaces exhibit a uniform, matte, soft-textured appearance consistent with velvet, with no shiny spots or reflections resembling gemstones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents wing surfaces with a matte, soft appearance, akin to velvet, without the shiny spots or reflections that gemstones have in Image A. Image A's wings feature bright reflective surfaces due to the crystals and metallic elements, whereas Image B uses fabric that maintains a uniform texture without any sheen, thus ensuring a different tactile experience.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the fluffy trim along the wing edges evenly distributed, soft, and attached in a way that follows the wing’s natural curve without appearing detached or uneven?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a fluffy trim along the wing edges, made of soft fabric, evenly distributed, and closely following the wing's natural curve. There is continuity and smoothness in the trim application, enhancing the plush nature of the butterfly. In Image A, the metallic and gemstone structure does not feature such a trim, but Image B uses embroidery techniques to create a similar effect while maintaining alignment and softness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the butterfly’s wings symmetrically shaped, the body proportionate to the wings, and the antennae correctly positioned and curved, with no visible warping or scaling errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B is symmetrically shaped, with wings that mirror each other. The body is proportionate to the wings, maintaining balance and harmony. The antennae are delicately curved and correctly positioned, showing no signs of warping or scaling errors. Image A similarly exhibits symmetry in the butterfly's design, albeit with a metal framework, illustrating a well-executed modification in Image B to preserve structural integrity.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly resting on a smooth, uniformly pearl-white cushion with a natural shadow underneath, indicating proper contact and physical grounding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is resting on a smooth, uniformly pearl-white cushion, providing a soft base. There is a natural shadow underneath the butterfly, indicating proper contact with the cushion and seamless grounding. Image A does not include a cushion, showcasing the butterfly resting on foliage, whereas Image B enhances the presentation by including a cushion that reflects thoughtful design choices.",
