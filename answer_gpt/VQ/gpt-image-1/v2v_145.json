      "question": "Do the enlarged and shiny mango pieces retain their natural texture and shape without appearing distorted or unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango has been transformed into a whimsical cartoon-like figurine with pronounced shiny surfaces. Usually, realistic mango pieces have a fibrous and matte texture. In the edited image, while the geometric shapes are intact, the texture is not natural and resembles a glossy surface typical of animated designs. It intentionally breaks from realistic textures to suit a stylized, playful appearance, which is a common practice in animations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the cartoon-like design of the lime and chili powder bowl appear visually credible and free from unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the lime and the chili powder bowl are stylized to match the overall cartoon aesthetic. The lime slice has exaggerated features such as simplified and bold patterns for the segments, while the chili powder bowl maintains its structural coherence. Applying the cartoon design style often involves such simplifications and renderings to ensure clarity and aesthetic appeal without artifacts like jagged edges or mismatched elements, resulting in a visually credible representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the overall composition and layout of the edited elements, including the whimsical mango figurine, lime, and chili powder bowl, visually credible and structurally consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of Image B maintains a coherent layout, positioning elements like the mango figurine, lime, and chili powder bowl in a balanced arrangement. While the image transforms these elements into cartoon-like versions, they retain structural consistency, and their placement reflects an organized arrangement that supports a visually compelling design. The whimsical style does not detract from the intended aesthetic but rather enhances it.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the shiny 3D effect on the mango pieces enhance the visual appeal without degrading fine details or introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mango in Image B is given a shiny, animated 3D effect, creating a playful and vibrant appearance. This transformation prioritizes visual appeal typical of animation style rather than detail accuracy. The impact of the shiny effect serves to enhance the mango's cartoonish character without focusing on realistic textures. The glossy finish is intentional for stylistic purposes, without attempting to reproduce fine details of natural mango.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the whimsical mango figurine retain its structural integrity and natural appearance, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is reimagined as a whimsical figurine with a friendly face, complete with rounded shapes and smooth transitions typical of cartoon figurines. The transformation respects the structural integrity, maintaining uniformity in geometric shapes without distortion. Although completely stylized, it avoids any broken shapes or distortions that could detract from its purpose as a playful representation.",
