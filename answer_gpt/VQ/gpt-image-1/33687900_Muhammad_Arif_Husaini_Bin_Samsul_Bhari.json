    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the crystalline hair of the water spirit follow the natural downward trajectory of the original waterfall, maintaining smooth, continuous flow lines that align with the surrounding rock contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water spirit's crystalline hair appears to flow downwards, resembling the trajectory of a waterfall. The smooth and continuous lines suggest an effort to maintain a natural look, similar to the fluid motion of water over a waterfall and aligning with the contours observed in such settings.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the luminescent blue hue of the water spirit evenly distributed and softly blended into the surrounding gray and dark rock surfaces without sharp edges or unnatural color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue hue in Image B is consistently vivid and merges well with the surrounding environment, creating a magical presence that gently blends into the rock surfaces, without noticeable sharp edges or harsh color transitions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vine-like appendages have consistent leaf shapes, spacing, and textures that match the surrounding vegetation, and do they grow naturally from the spiritâ€™s body without floating or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vine-like appendages in Image B feature consistent shapes and spacing, aligning well with the style of surrounding vegetation. They appear to grow naturally from the spirit's body, avoiding any disconnected or misaligned appearances.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the glowing basin reflect light in a way that matches the direction of the falling water and surrounding environment, showing coherent wave patterns and no flat or uniform glow that contradicts natural light behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a glowing basin at the base of the spirit, with light reflections showing dynamic and coherent patterns that mimic the expected behavior of light interacting with water, reinforcing a realistic environmental context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crystalline surfaces of the spirit composed of clear, defined facets with realistic light refraction and shadowing, avoiding pixelation, smudging, or repetitive patterns that suggest digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystalline surfaces feature smooth, defined facets that handle light refraction and shadowing in a manner resembling real-world crystalline structures, without digital artifacts or smudging affecting the visual quality.",
