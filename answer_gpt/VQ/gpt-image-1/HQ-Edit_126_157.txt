    "Question": "Q1: Does the boat exhibit consistent aged wood texture with natural grain patterns and no repeating or unnatural surface artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boat has a consistent texture typical of wooden surfaces, including visible grain patterns. The texture appears uniform and realistic without any obvious repetition or artifacts that might indicate editing errors or unnatural elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the distant hills rendered with smooth pastel blue gradients that transition naturally without sharp boundaries or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases hills at a distance, rendered in a smooth pastel blue gradient, transitioning softly without harsh lines or pixelation. These visual elements adhere to common digital painting techniques that ensure a natural and cohesive look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there small, clear droplet-like etchings on the water surface that resemble ripples without disrupting the reflection or causing visual distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface is characterized by small droplet-like shapes etched delicately, distinct from the typical ripple patterns seen on water. Despite this choice, these etchings do not disrupt reflections or distort the view, offering an artistic touch while maintaining visual harmony.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a hand-carved wooden frame surrounding the scene with realistic texture, depth, and structural coherence?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a frame around the scene, which presents a tactile and realistic wood texture. Attention to detail in the carving provides depth and structural integrity, aligning with common characteristics expected from authentic wooden frames.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the boat, water, and hills arranged in layered 3D cutouts with correct spatial depth and no misalignment or floating elements?",
    "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a design resembling layered 3D cutouts, where the boat, water, and hills appear stacked with accurate spatial depth enhancements. There are no visible misalignments or floating elements, suggesting a thoughtful composition respecting spatial coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
