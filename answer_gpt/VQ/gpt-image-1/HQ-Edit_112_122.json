    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the dress clearly defined, proportionally consistent with the garment’s scale, and free from jagged edges or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the dress shows stylized forms rather than detailed floral patterns. The floral patterns are part of the surrounding design elements and not present on the dress itself. The design on the dress is smooth and consistent with the illustrative style intended in the image. There are no indications of pixelated artifacts or jagged edges as the artwork exhibits a clean, cartoonish vibrancy consistent with the outlined theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lighting from the top right cast soft gradients on the woman’s face, dress, and nearby flowers without causing unnatural overexposure or disconnected highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is stylized and evokes a sense of brightness without adhering strictly to realistic light dynamics. The background includes vibrant, flat colors and the depiction of light does not show gradients but rather a uniform presence. The illustrative style focuses on bold and simple color schemes rather than realistic lighting, meaning concerns like overexposure or disconnected highlights aren't applicable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the floating petals distributed evenly in mid-air, showing natural dispersion and depth, with no clustered or floating-in-place anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distribution of the petals around the character is even and consistent with the illustrative style. The petals are arranged to complement the whimsical and flat art style without implying physical depth. There is no observed clustering, and the artistic intention supports the purposefully flat and stylized perspective without representing real depth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the floral vines forming the writing area extend naturally from surrounding plants, maintaining consistent thickness, color, and growth direction without abrupt starts or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents floral vines that border the writing area with consistent thickness and color throughout the design. The motif emphasizes continuity and ornamental symmetry typical in stylized artwork, maintaining a seamless flow around the card, which reflects a harmonious extension of surrounding decorative elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the woman’s left hand show five distinct fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and does the hand appear attached correctly to the arm without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hand is simplified and stylized with the apparent intention of fitting an illustrative art style. There are no distinct fingers showing separation or natural curvature, as seen in realistic portrayals. It also seamlessly integrates into her arm without noticeable distortion, aligning with the cartoon characteristic of the art.",
