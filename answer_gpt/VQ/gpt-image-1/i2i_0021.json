      "question": "Do the chibi-style sheep retain proportional accuracy and structural coherence relative to their original poses near the fence in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "First, analyzing Image B, the chibi sheep are drawn in a simplified and stylized manner, characteristic of the chibi art style, which doesn't necessarily aim for proportional accuracy but rather focuses on cuteness and charm through exaggerated features. The chibi sheep in Image B are standing side by side, appearing upright and balanced with clear facial features. Now considering Image A, the sheep and goats are depicted in natural poses near a fence with realistic proportions, standing in a snowy environment. Comparing both images, Image B intentionally diverges from the realistic proportions of Image A, opting instead for a playful and stylized depiction. Thus, the structural coherence is different due to the stylistic choice.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added accessories (red scarf, knit hat, and small bell) free of unnatural textures and logically placed on the chibi sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B, the red scarf, knit hat, and small bell are added accessories on the chibi sheep, portrayed in a simplified, cartoonish manner. They have smooth lines with no complex textures, consistent with the style. They appear logically placed: the scarf is neatly wrapped around the neck of the sheep, the hat rests aptly on the middle sheep's head, and the bell is positioned around the neck of the right sheep. These placements reflect conventional accessory usage, maintaining visual coherence. Image A shows no such accessories, as it depicts the real animals without embellishments.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the thick white outlines and flat colors applied to the chibi sheep create a visually coherent and artifact-free appearance, maintaining their structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thick white outlines and flat colors are characteristic of the chibi art style, contributing to a clear, clean separation of each character from the background and maintaining visual integrity. These features create a cohesive and charming appearance, free of artifacts, which complements the cartoonish nature. The integrity is kept as the outlines define shapes distinctly, avoiding any visual artifacts. Unlike Image A that has natural colors and realistic proportions, Image B uses flat colors without shading, suited for the chibi aesthetic.",

      "question": "Does the positioning of the chibi sheep near the fence remain visually credible, preserving their original spatial relationship with the environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the chibi sheep without any backdrop representing a fence, rather as standalone cartoon figures. Spatial positioning in chibi art is often more about character relation than environmental realism. Image A, however, shows sheep and goats positioned in a real environment by a fence. Image B does not attempt to maintain the environmental setting, focusing on character representation over spatial credibility, which differs from the environmental context of Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background successfully made transparent without visible artifacts or remnants of the snowy landscape affecting the clean appearance of the chibi sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the background appears to be entirely transparent, emphasizing the chibi figures against a blank or adjustable backdrop, which contributes to a clean visual presentation free from remnants. This contrasts with Image Aâ€™s snowy landscape background, showcasing animals in their natural setting. Image B effectively removes any trace of the original landscape, focusing solely on character clarity.",
