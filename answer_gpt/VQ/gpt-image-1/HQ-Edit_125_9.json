      "question": "Does the textured grain overlay appear uniformly distributed across the entire image without causing visible distortion or obscuring fine details such as the soccer ball’s pentagons or facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable grain overlay that creates a textured appearance across the image. This effect is applied evenly and does not obscure key details such as the pentagons on the soccer ball. The distribution of texture is uniform, meaning fine details remain distinguishable and there is no significant visual distortion.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reds on the player's jersey and socks appear vivid and enhanced but maintain a realistic hue without bleeding into adjacent regions such as skin tones or shadowed areas.

      "question": "Are the houses and trees in the background reduced to simplified silhouettes without losing their basic structural form or introducing broken edges or floating shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the background elements such as the houses and trees are rendered as more uniform silhouettes. These elements maintain their basic shapes, and their edges remain intact without any appearance of floating shapes or structural fragmentation, which keeps the composition coherent.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text \"Footy Legends\" placed across the bottom of the image in a way that does not block essential foreground elements like the soccer ball or the player's foot, and does it blend cohesively with the background without sharp edges or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Footy Legends' text is strategically positioned at the bottom. It complements the overall image cohesively and does not conceal any critical foreground elements such as the soccer ball or player’s foot. The text integrates smoothly and aligns well with the image's composition, ensuring that it does not stand out awkwardly.",
