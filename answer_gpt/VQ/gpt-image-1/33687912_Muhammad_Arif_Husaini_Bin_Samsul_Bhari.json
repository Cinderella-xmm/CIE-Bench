    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the shell-like body of the creature have consistent curvature and smooth surface transitions without visible cracks, misaligned segments, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shell-like body of the creature exhibits a seamless and smooth surface with a consistent curvature. The design does not show any cracks, misaligned segments, or distorted shapes, implying an artistic choice for fluidity and cohesion in the creature's form. The continuous curves and absence of visual disruptions contribute to its organic appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the coral-like spires distributed organically along the back of the creature, with varying heights and irregular shapes that resemble natural coral formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The coral-like spires on the creature's back are designed to mimic natural coral formations, featuring irregular shapes and varying heights. This organic distribution enhances the resemblance to coral, reflecting nature's randomness and diversity in form, which is characteristic of real coral structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the glowing sea guardian spirits emit soft, diffused light that originates from their bodies and does not produce sharp halos or isolated bright spots outside their forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sea guardian spirits appear to emit a gentle and diffuse glow from within their forms. The light is evenly distributed, lacking sharp halos or isolated bright spots, contributing to a serene and ethereal presence consistent with a supernatural or mythical theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the luminescent wave pattern behind the creature flow smoothly in the same direction as the original wake, with colors transitioning gradually from warm orange to deep red matching the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminescent wave pattern behind the creature does not match the original wake's direction or color gradation. The colors in the wave are more vibrant and distinct from the sky's hues, without a smooth transition or the calming warm tones of the sunset. This difference highlights a departure from the original natural setting.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature cast a faint shadow on the water surface beneath it, and are its illuminated parts consistent with the direction of sunlight from the setting sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no obvious shadow cast by the creature on the water surface beneath it, and its illuminated parts do not show a clear correlation with the direction of sunlight from the setting sun. The glow appears to be predominantly from the creature itself rather than due to external lighting effects, suggesting an artistic emphasis on internal luminescence rather than realistic lighting.",
