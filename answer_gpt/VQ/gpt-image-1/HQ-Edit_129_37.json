      "question": "Does the glass container maintain the original circular shape and proportions of the compass body, with no warped edges or irregular thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass container, which is designed to resemble a compass, retains a largely circular shape. The proportions appear consistent, and the edges do not show signs of warping or irregular thickness. This suggests careful attention to maintaining the integrity of the original compass design in its transformation into a perfume bottle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the spray nozzle centered within the glass container, aligned with the pivot point of the original needle, and does it have a smooth, continuous metallic surface without jagged edges or textural inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spray nozzle is positioned at the top and appears centered along the vertical axis of the bottle, aligning conceptually with what might be the pivot point of the original compass needle. The surface of the nozzle looks smooth and continuous, without visible jagged edges or textural inconsistencies, suggesting precision in its design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cap feature a detailed engraving of a vintage map that is evenly distributed across its surface, with no blurred lines or inconsistent depth, and is it attached seamlessly to the top of the glass container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the cap does not feature an engraving of a vintage map. Instead, it is a simple metallic design without the map detailing. Therefore, there are no blurred lines or depth inconsistencies. The cap appears to be attached seamlessly, but the specific criteria about the engraving itself are not met.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bronze gradient applied smoothly across the glass container and cap, with subtle variations in tone that simulate wear and light reflection, and no sharp color boundaries or artificial sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bronze gradient across the glass container in Image B is applied smoothly, with noticeable subtle variations in tone that effectively mimic the effects of wear and light reflection. These variations contribute to a realistic metallic look without any sharp color boundaries or artificial sheen, enhancing the vintage aesthetic.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the branding text visible along the outer rim of the glass container, with consistent font size and spacing, and does it appear embedded into the surface without overlapping or floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branding text 'COMPASS EAU DE PARFUM' is visible on the outer rim of the glass container. The font size and spacing are consistent, and the text appears to be embedded into the surface. There are no signs of the text overlapping or floating, suggesting well-executed typography.",
