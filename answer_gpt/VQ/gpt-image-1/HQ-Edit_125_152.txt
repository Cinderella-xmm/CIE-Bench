    "Question": "Q1: Are the sheet music patterns integrated into the wing’s orange sections without breaking the natural vein lines or causing visible texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wing features sheet music patterns that are overlaid onto the orange sections. Observing the integration, the musical notes appear to align well with the wing's natural coloring and do not disrupt the original vein lines. This suggests a smooth application without creating any visual disruption or texture artifacts in the wing's pattern. The wing maintains a coherent texture that appears to naturally incorporate the musical design.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the petal shapes of the newly added flowers formed like musical notes but still maintain natural curvature and thickness consistent with real petals?",
    "explanation": "Image B features playful, anthropomorphized flowers with petals that mimic musical notes, creating a whimsical atmosphere. Despite this artistic interpretation, the petals maintain a natural curvature and the thickness is visually consistent with real flower petals. This balance allows the floral elements to remain believable within the artistic style, ensuring they resemble both musical notes and petals.",
