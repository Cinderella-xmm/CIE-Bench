      "question": "Do the wombat's eyes appear naturally large and expressive without any distortion or unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wombat's eyes are drawn in a cartoonish style, typical for chibi or kawaii art, with large, round shapes and bright highlights that convey expressiveness. The design maintains a consistent and natural appearance for this art style. Unlike realistic imagery, chibi characters often have oversized eyes to emphasize emotions, resulting in naturally large and expressive eyes that do not appear distorted or carry unnatural artifacts here.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the sitting posture of the wombat in all six poses maintain structural consistency and visual credibility similar to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the wombat in four different poses. Across these images, the overall posture is chibi in nature, which allows for playful variations while maintaining a likeness to the original but more detailed posture seen in Image A. Each pose is consistent in terms of character structural integrity and visual appeal appropriate to this art style.",

      "question": "Are the textures and details of the Hawaiian shirt and straw hat preserved without any unnatural artifacts or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the wombat in a simplified art style, and the Hawaiian shirt retains its basic pattern of circles and overlay motifs similar to Image A. The straw hat is simple but identifiable, matching the cartoonish theme of the image. Given the stylistic change, there's no unexpected loss of detailâ€”a common trade-off for a more simplified art style.",

      "question": "Do the background elements like hibiscus flowers and palm fronds integrate seamlessly into the scene without causing any visual distortion or unnatural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backgrounds behind each expression are filled with floral and leafy elements that match the tropical theme conveyed in Image A. The depiction of these elements does not introduce any distortion or unnatural artifacts. They provide a harmonious backdrop that enhances, rather than detracts from, the main focus of each character sticker.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there adequate clean white space around each sticker, ensuring visual clarity and avoiding any cluttered appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each wombat illustration is presented clearly separated from the others with ample white space surrounding each one. This layout ensures the stickers are visually distinct and that no part of the drawing appears crowded or messy. The design effectively uses spacing to maintain the visual focus on the individual stickers.",
