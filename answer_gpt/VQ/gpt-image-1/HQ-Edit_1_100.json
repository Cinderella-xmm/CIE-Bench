      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the character’s face retain natural proportions and smooth contours despite the half-cartoon style transformation, without visible distortion in facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, depicts a character where facial features have been artistically transformed into a cartoon style. This transformation results in simplified and exaggerated features typically seen in such illustrations, but the overall facial structure appears proportionally correct within the artistic style. The contours are smooth and the character's design follows the norms of cartoon portrayal without visible distortion. Thus, the face retains its aesthetic integrity in the cartoon style without any noticeable structural deformity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the elongated book's shape geometrically consistent with a real book, maintaining uniform page thickness and aligned edges without warping or stretching artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shape of the book follows a stylized, exaggerated form common in cartoon illustrations. However, it maintains uniform page thickness and the edges are neatly aligned, simulating the dimensionality and structure of a real book even with simplified illustrations. There are no visible distortions or artifacts like warping or stretching that would break the geometric consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the sleeves exhibit natural fabric draping with consistent lighting, shadow depth, and fold patterns that align with gravity and textile behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric of the sleeves is stylized as part of the cartoon transformation, with exaggerated and simplified lines. Despite this artistic interpretation, the illustration maintains consistency in drooping and folding patterns typical of a garment under gravity. However, these do not realistically follow the complex lighting and shadow interactions found in real textiles but are simplified for stylistic purposes. Given the style parameters, the depiction aligns acceptably with textile behavior for a half-cartoon style transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the golden filigree details on the buttons clearly rendered and integrated into the button surface without visible artifacts, such as jagged edges or mismatched reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, the buttons are simplified to align with the overall cartoon style. While intricate details like filigree are absent due to simplification, the buttons themselves are well-rendered for this style. The integration appears smooth, without visible artifacts common in poorly rendered digital images such as jagged edges or inconsistent reflections. They appear cohesive with the fabric design in the cartoon context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the library shelves transformed into a wooden frame background with consistent wood grain, edge alignment, and depth cues that maintain spatial logic and avoid broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the library shelves have been reduced to a simpler, more stylized depiction consistent with the half-cartoon theme. While less detailed than in a realistic image, the wood grain, depth cues, and edge alignment are consistent with the simplified visual narrative and maintain spatial logic. There are no broken geometries; all elements are intentionally designed to fit the artistic transformation, supporting the scene’s spatial coherence within the cartoon style.",
