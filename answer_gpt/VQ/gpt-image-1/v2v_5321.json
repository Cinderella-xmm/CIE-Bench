      "question": "Do the stripes on the character's costume maintain their clarity and definition without unnatural blurring or distortion in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes on the character's costume maintain a consistent pattern despite the claymation effect, which is known to often simplify details. However, the stripes are clearly defined without blurring or distortion. They appear intentionally stylized to suit the claymation aesthetic, where textures are typically simplified yet discernible. The stripes are evenly spaced and maintain straight lines, indicating clarity of design.",

      "question": "Does the beret retain its original shape and placement on the character's head without appearing unnaturally warped or misplaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beret atop the character's head maintains its rounded shape and is placed naturally, conforming to typical claymation styling where objects may be sculpted to visually reflect their real-world counterparts while adhering to a simplified form. The beret's shape is consistent with real hat styles, fitting well on the head without visible warping or distortion.",

      "question": "Are the fingers on the character's hand holding the phone naturally shaped and textured, without any unnatural distortions or missing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fingers holding the phone are rendered in a claymation style that often simplifies human appendages. Despite this stylization, the fingers maintain a natural shape, with all necessary digits depicted correctly. The clay aesthetics don't lead to any unnatural distortion, and the overall form adheres to expected human proportionality without missing key details.",

      "question": "Do the European rooftops and buildings in the background retain their structural integrity and visual plausibility without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B, depicting European-style roofs and buildings, maintains structural integrity indicative of claymation design, which simplifies yet preserves key architectural elements, like windows and roof shapes. Despite the clay texture, the buildings are rendered to appear visually plausible, with distinct outlines and recognizable forms indicative of European architecture.",

      "question": "Does the character's pose, including the way they hold the phone, appear natural and consistent with human ergonomics in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's pose remains consistent with natural human ergonomics despite being rendered in a claymation style. The posture, including arm placement and the act of holding a phone, is depicted realistically, adhering to common human gestures. The claymation aesthetic captures the pose accurately, showing an understanding of human movement even in simplified form.",
