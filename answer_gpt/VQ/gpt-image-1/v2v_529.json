      "question": "Does the LEGO minifigure version of the individual maintain a natural appearance without any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO minifigure captures the essence of a toy character, characterized by its smooth plastic texture and simple forms typical of LEGO design. The minifigure's lack of detail and stylized articulation is intentional, reflecting the classic design inherent in LEGO toys. This corresponds with viewers' expectations of LEGO's visual style, where simplicity and abstract representation are standard. Therefore, the minifigure's appearance seems deliberate rather than flawed, supporting its natural appearance as a LEGO item.",

The animal lacks apparent distortions, maintaining recognizability and coherence with the intended LEGO style.",
