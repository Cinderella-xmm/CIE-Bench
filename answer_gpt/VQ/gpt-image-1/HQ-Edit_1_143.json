    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features of the scientist proportionally accurate and free from exaggerated or distorted shapes such as elongated eyes, misaligned nose, or uneven lip contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the character is depicted in a stylized, cartoon-like fashion typical of illustrations used in calendars. Such illustrations often simplify or exaggerate features for artistic reasons rather than aim for realistic proportions, so the concept of proportionally accurate facial features does not apply directly in the same way it would for a realistic depiction.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lab coat exhibit natural fabric folds and subtle shading consistent with real-world draping, without appearing uniformly flat or lacking depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lab coat is part of a stylized illustration, which typically emphasizes bold lines and flat colors over realistic texture and depth. The depiction of fabric folds and shading is minimal and simplified, consistent with this artistic style rather than realistic representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the pipette have exactly five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and are the joints and knuckles positioned realistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand is illustrated in a simplified, cartoon-like manner, which often results in less emphasis on anatomy precision. The number of fingers might be correct, but the curvature, spacing, and detailing of joints/knuckles are stylized and not realistically represented.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the test tubes display uniform liquid levels and clear glass surfaces with coherent reflections and refractions, without visible texture distortions or broken geometric outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The test tubes in Image B are illustrated in a simplified style consistent with the overall cartoon-like aesthetic of the calendar design. They do not aim to portray realistic liquid levels, reflections, or refractions, and instead feature a more uniform and flat depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the components of the microscope and adjacent control panel correctly aligned and proportionally scaled, with no misplaced parts or floating elements that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, components like the microscope and control panel are part of a stylized, simplified art style, placing more emphasis on visual coherence within the cartoon context rather than realistic alignment and scaling. Given its illustrative nature, proportional accuracy is not a primary concern.",
