    "Question": "Q3: Do the washing machines and interior elements inside the laundromat look like they are made of Lego bricks, preserving their structural integrity and avoiding broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the washing machines and interior are composed of distinct Lego-style blocks, with a clear geometric structure typical of Lego designs. The structural integrity of the elements is preserved, with no broken shapes, making them closely resemble real Lego creations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the stack of folded laundry held by the person retain its natural appearance and texture, without appearing as if it is made of Lego bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stack of folded laundry does not retain a natural textile appearance and clearly follows the blocky aesthetic of Lego bricks. The laundry appears as a stack of rectangular, blocky shapes, indicative of Lego construction, rather than smooth, natural fabric.",
