    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the castle icon used for the HOMEPAGE positioned centrally and sized proportionally to fit within the original white rounded rectangle area without overlapping nearby elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central element appears to be a castle icon, which is prominently placed and seems to occupy the central position. However, it does not align with the position of the original white rounded rectangle area from Image A, because it is part of an entirely different image setup. The icon seems appropriately sized considering its environment in the treasure map theme, but it does not relate to the original structure of the site map (Image A), as those elements and configurations are not present. Therefore, given the transformation into a completely different theme, the question of central placement related to the original site map layout is not applicable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the connection lines between the HOMEPAGE and main sections (e.g., PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS, ABOUT US) transformed into smooth, winding trails with no broken segments or irregular widths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a whimsical treasure map theme, where paths between elements resemble dotted lines commonly found in treasure maps. These trails appear smooth and winding without broken segments or significant inconsistencies in width, aligning with their thematic transformation from the connection lines in Image A's site map structure to support a narrative akin to a journey or exploration.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the icon replacing \"PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS\" clearly visible, properly aligned within the orange rounded rectangle, and appropriately scaled so it doesn't extend beyond the border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have specific sections like 'PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS'. Instead, it consists of various whimsical icons and illustrations that do not directly correlate with the structured hierarchy of Image A. There is no orange rounded rectangle specifically designated for an icon from 'PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS', and no such section or icon alignment is needed or applicable. Therefore, within the context of a thematic map without a direct analogy to the original layout, the comparison cannot be made.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the decorative elements (e.g., trees, creatures) placed along the winding trails in gaps between nodes and do they have smooth outlines and consistent coloring without jagged edges or noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative elements, including trees and creatures, are positioned around and along the winding trails. These elements are stylized and cartoonish, featuring smooth and clear outlines and consistent coloring, fitting the aesthetic of a children's treasure map. The elements exhibit no noticeable jagged edges or noise, maintaining a cohesive style throughout the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the text in the blue rounded rectangles (e.g., \"News\", \"Events\") use a consistent, bold, child-friendly font that remains fully contained within the bounds of each shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation leads to an absence of structured text components like those in Image A within blue rounded rectangles. Instead, this image consists of playful icons and does not contain text elements analogous to those in the original site map layout. Consequently, there are no blue rounded rectangles framing text to assess for consistency, readability, or containment.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the different levels of the site map (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th) still visually separable based on color coding or size differences, despite the change in style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents a playful treasure map with an entirely different theme and organization from Image A. The concept of hierarchical levels structured by color coding or size differences from a site map does not translate into the treemap style. Different elements are not organized into levels akin to those in Image A but are instead scattered across the map without a clear visual hierarchy related to any conceptual leveling. Hence, there is no coherent separation or designation of levels as in the original site map.",
