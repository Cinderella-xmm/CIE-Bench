    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the spherical glass dome transparent and smooth, with no visible seams, distortions, or incorrect light refractions affecting the sandcastle inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the glass dome appears clear, allowing visibility of the sandcastle with no apparent distortions or seams. The transparency and clarity are consistent with that of a high-quality glass dome, facilitating undistorted visibility of the sandcastle. Therefore, the conclusion is drawn from the observation of the clear transparency and reflection detail on the dome.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the mahogany base have a natural wood texture and consistent thickness, and is it properly scaled to support the dome and sandcastle without appearing distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base presents a texture typical of polished mahogany, with consistent coloring and grain detail. The thickness and scaling are proportionate to both the dome and the sandcastle, creating a harmonious and stable appearance. This analysis is based on observing the wood finish and proportional support relative to the dome.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glittering grains evenly distributed and subtle enough to mimic sand texture without obscuring fine architectural details of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sandcastle with a uniformly subtle distribution of glittering grains that resemble sand. These grains do not interfere with the visibility of the towers or arches, allowing attention to architectural detail. The analysis stems from observing the surface texture and visibility of structural components.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the seashells around the sandcastle clearly defined, appropriately small in scale, and free from pixelation or unnatural edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seashells depicted in Image B are clearly defined with smooth edges, free from visual distortions like pixelation. Their scale is consistent with maintaining the sandcastle’s proportional dominance. This conclusion is derived from observing the minute details of each shell's surface and edge.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ceramic plaque with “Empire of the Shores” inscribed clearly readable, properly attached to the base, and displaying a uniform matte pearl surface without glare or texture mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the plaque as clearly legible with text sharply inscribed. It is well-attached to the base with no visible gaps, while the surface exhibits a consistent matte finish that avoids excessive glare. This analysis takes into account the plaque's integration with the base and the textural consistency seen.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the matte pearl finish uniformly applied across the sandcastle and surrounding shells, with no areas showing excessive shine or reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a consistent matte pearl finish across both the sandcastle and the shells. There are no areas of gloss or abnormal reflections disrupting the visual texture, contributing to a homogenous appearance. This observation considers the consistent sheen across all elements depicted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all architectural elements of the sandcastle (towers, stairs, arches) intact and geometrically consistent, with no stretching, bending, or missing sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle maintains geometric coherence with intact towers, stairs, and arches. The structure appears stable with no visual anomalies such as bending or stretching. This conclusion is drawn from scrutinizing the continuity and symmetry of architectural features.",
