      "question": "Does the lace-textured finish on the figurine preserve the fine details of the original dress, such as the ruffles and embroidery, without introducing pixelation or unnatural texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine displays a lace-textured finish that mirrors the intricate elements of the original dress in Image A. The ruffles and embroidery motifs are finely detailed and consistent, without signs of pixelation or repetitive patterns that would disrupt the visual integrity. Such a lace finish typically adheres to the original's detailed design, and common sense dictates that an artist would ensure the preservation of these fine details in a figurine. Comparatively analyzing both images, Image B maintains the expected level of detail without introducing distortion.",
