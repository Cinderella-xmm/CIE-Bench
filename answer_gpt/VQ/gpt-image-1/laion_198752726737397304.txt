    "Question": "Q1: Do the superhero costumes on all five individuals have consistent fabric textures and realistic draping that follow the contours of their bodies without unnatural stretching or folding?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the superhero costumes are drawn in a cartoon style, which typically features exaggerated and smooth surfaces without intricate fabric textures. The costumes appear uniformly green and blue, which is consistent with the comic style that prioritizes flat colors over realistic textures.

    "Question": "Q2: Are the hands holding the Daffodil Power Passes positioned naturally with five fingers visible per hand, appropriate grip pressure, and no signs of clipping or floating objects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, cartoon-style illustrations often simplify hand shapes and proportions. Therefore, in the edited image, the hands might not depict all five fingers distinctly, and the grip might look stylized rather than natural. The hands holding the passes show limited detail due to stylistic choice, which is typical in graphic images aiming for clarity and simplicity rather than realism.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the poses of the five individuals physically plausible, with joints aligned naturally and no bent limbs or disproportionate body segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the poses of the individuals are exaggerated in a comic style, which may sometimes distort natural anatomy for effect or humor. The characters are depicted with confident and bold stances associated with superhero themes, which might not align with realistic depictions of human anatomy.
