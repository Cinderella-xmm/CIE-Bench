      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style character maintain proper proportions and avoid unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the chibi-style character exhibits a distinctive design characterized by exaggerated features such as a large head and small body, which are typical of 3D chibi styles. This style inherently involves these adjustments, and there are no apparent distortions beyond what is expected from this art style. Therefore, the character maintains appropriate proportions for a chibi design.",
