      "question": "Are the lines forming the chevron pattern on the front panel evenly spaced, angularly consistent, and free from jagged edges or irregularities that suggest distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the lines forming the chevron pattern on the front panel appear to be evenly spaced and angularly consistent. The lines are straight and maintain a symmetrical, precise pattern, which suggests no distortion or irregularities. This observation is based on how geometric patterns should ideally look like in well-crafted design illustrations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold zippers retain their linear definition and proper placement along the seams, with no misalignment or broken segments suggesting artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold zippers exhibit a clean, linear definition and are properly aligned along the seams. They do not appear misaligned, nor do they show any broken segments or artifacts. This conclusion is drawn from observing the clear lines and proper closure that are typical of well-detailed illustrations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the olive tone applied uniformly across the surface of the bag, with no patchy areas, color bleeding, or inconsistent saturation that suggests digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a uniformly applied olive tone across the surface of the bag. There are no visible patchy areas or color bleeding, and the saturation appears consistent throughout. This analysis is based on the expectations for a digital illustration that aims to show color consistency and uniformity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blank message area on the back of the postcard aligned with the dimensions of the front design, with straight edges and no visible warping or layering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blank message area on the postcard is perfectly aligned with the dimensions of the front design. The edges appear straight and there are no visible signs of warping or layering errors, which suggests a well-executed layout consistent with professional illustration standards.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the black portfolio contain the postcard with proper depth and alignment, showing no clipping, shadow mismatches, or unnatural gaps between the postcard and the portfolio walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black portfolio in Image B contains the postcard with appropriate depth and alignment, as evidenced by the absence of clipping or shadow mismatches. There are no unnatural gaps between the postcard and the portfolio walls, indicating careful attention to detail in the representation of depth and spatial relations.",
