        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine appears to be made of a soft vinyl or plastic material, characterized by a smooth, matte surface typical of collectible figurines.

      "question": "Are the proportions and placement of the figurine on the white ceramic coffee table appropriate and physically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By analyzing Image B, the figurine is appropriately scaled for such a decorative setting and fits well on the table given usual dimensions of collectible figurines. Its placement allows for additional items like a teapot and cup, suggesting sufficient space allocation and plausible scene arrangement. This aligns with common decorative practices in interior setups where elements are sized proportional to the furniture dimensions they are displayed on.",

      "question": "Do the green plants blend naturally with the rest of the scene without appearing out of place or introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green plants in the background are coherent with the rest of the setting, complementing the tonal palette with their uniform texture and realistic color gradients often found in indoor plants. The plants do not introduce any anomalies that would disrupt the visual flow of the image, adhering to the typical appearance seen in real-world environments.",

      "question": "Do the tea utensils appear correctly sized and positioned relative to the figurine and other elements, contributing positively to the scene’s visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the teapot and teacup are realistically sized and positioned, complementing the figurine and maintaining coherence in the overall arrangement. Their size is consistent with standard tea utensils seen on coffee or snack tables in similar scenes. This size and positioning do not overshadow the figurine, thereby creating a balanced visual composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a well-composed scene with various elements harmoniously integrated. There are no visible artifacts or distortions, such as unnatural blurring or misaligned features, which would typically detract from realism. The distinct items—figurine, teapot, plants—are presented clearly and cohesively without evidence of which might suggest editing errors, maintaining an aesthetically pleasing and realistic visual composition.",
