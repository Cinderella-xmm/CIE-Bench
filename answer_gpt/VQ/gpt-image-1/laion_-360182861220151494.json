    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the character’s eyes in Panel 1 clearly narrowed and intense, with visible tension in the eyelids and pupils, and is the hand gripping the katana properly aligned with five distinct fingers showing natural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, focusing strictly on the parts excluding the face, the tension in the character's eyes cannot be gauged due to the blur. However, examining the hand gripping the katana reveals somewhat simplified finger representation with less detailed shaping compared to Image A, deviating from natural curvature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the character’s leaping pose in Panel 2 show correct leg extension and arm positioning consistent with forward momentum, and do the fiery trails originate naturally from the hair strands without overlapping into solid parts of the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the character's leap showcases proper arm positioning and dynamic leg posture, characteristic of forward movement. Additionally, the trails emanating from the hair strands follow a consistent path without merging into the body, preserving the intended design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the katana in Panel 3 correctly oriented forward without clipping through the character’s uniform or distorting the sleeve, and are the surrounding energy swirls continuous and free of pixelated or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 3 of Image B, the katana is oriented forward without any evident clipping through the attire, maintaining integrity in its alignment. The energy swirls around retain their form without visible pixelation or disjointed segments.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B in all panels, the proportions of the character remain consistent. There are no signs of disproportionate stretching or compression affecting the anatomy or alignment, ensuring coherence in depiction relative to typical designs.",
