    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass container display natural transparency with visible embossed patterns that do not appear distorted or unnaturally stretched?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass container shows a clear and precise embossed pattern, with natural transparency that is true to real-world characteristics of glass materials designed this way. The pattern details are consistent and maintain their shape, indicating no distortion or stretching. This suggests that the visual representation respects physical laws related to glass embossing and cleanliness.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the candle snuffer finial proportionally aligned with the glass container and structurally connected without gaps or floating elements?",
    "explanation": "Based on the visual inspection of Image B, the finial of the candle snuffer is properly aligned with the glass container. It appears as if it is hovering above the wick, which is typical for such a design to prevent gaps and maintain continuity in style. There are no visual gaps or indicators of disconnected or floating pieces, which signifies structural cohesiveness.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Does the marble base show consistent veining and reflective surface without any remnants of lace texture or unnatural seams?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the marble base visibly displays typical marble characteristics such as natural veining and a reflective surface that catches light appropriately. There is no appearance of lace texture or seams suggesting integration with another layer, hence it showcases a realistic marble texture without artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the nameplate attached to the side of the container at a natural height and angle, with no floating or clipping artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The nameplate in Image B is positioned naturally on the side of the container, adhering well to the contour of the glass, with no signs of clipping or floating. It maintains a reasonable height and angle relative to how labels typically adhere to such containers, without visual glitches.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the reflections and shadows on the glass container, marble base, and finial align with the direction of the light source and exhibit consistent material behavior?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in Image B indicates directional light with shadows and reflections consistent across all elements - the glass container, marble base, and finial. These shadows and reflections align logically with the light source direction, suggesting consistent and realistic material behavior observed as it interacts with light.",
    "answer": "Yes"
