      "question": "Does the addition of the \"Clean First\" slogan in the top left corner maintain the natural appearance and does not introduce any obvious artifacts like blurry edges or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Clean First' slogan is added to the top left corner. The font used is clear and sharp, blending well with the background without causing any obvious artifacts such as blurry edges or inconsistent lighting. The letters appear crisp and do not disrupt the visual integrity of the image. In situations like this, a well-implemented text overlay should appear as though it's naturally part of the image without any distracting visual effects.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the \"Comfort Always\" slogan added in the bottom right corner visually credible, maintaining structural consistency and not causing any distortion or degradation of the surrounding tiles' texture and details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Comfort Always' slogan is positioned in the bottom right corner. The font is consistent with the 'Clean First' slogan, and upon inspection, the addition does not appear to distort or degrade the texture and details of the surrounding tiles. For a text overlay to be visually credible, it needs to fit seamlessly with its environment, maintaining the pre-existing elements' integrity and not causing any visible disruption.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the fonts and styles of both slogans blend naturally with the background, avoiding any unnatural textures or interruptions in the tile patterns behind them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both slogans use a bold, clear font that stands out against the tiled background. However, they do not create unnatural textures or interrupt the tile patterns, as the background remains consistent and undistorted. A good font choice for overlays should ensure that the text is legible yet integrated into the image without noticeably disrupting the background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sizes and placements of the \"Clean First\" and \"Comfort Always\" slogans create a balanced composition that complements the image without overwhelming the toilet and its setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sizes of the 'Clean First' and 'Comfort Always' slogans are proportionate and placed strategically not to overwhelm the image's main element, the toilet. The slogans are located on either side of the image, creating a balanced composition that guides the viewer's attention across the scene. Well-compared elements of typography should enhance, not overpower, the primary subjects within the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the slogans aligned in a way that respects the geometric shapes of the tiled walls and floor, ensuring the structural and visual coherence of the entire image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the slogans are aligned horizontally in a way that corresponds with the geometric shapes and grid formed by the tiled walls and floor. This alignment maintains structural and visual coherence across the image, where any misalignment could disrupt the clean lines and cohesion typically offered by the tiles. Proper alignment respects the underlying patterns, enhancing the overall seamless appearance of the composition.",
