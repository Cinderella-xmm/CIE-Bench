    "Question": "Q1: Are the LEGO brick structures aligned with the original sock’s contours, maintaining consistent proportions and avoiding warped or stretched geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture made of LEGO bricks resembles the

original sock's structure from Image A. The contours, such as the calf curve and foot angles, are appropriately recreated with the layered bricks. There are no apparent warped or stretched aspects visible—the sock maintains the form found in the original, suggesting alignment with the natural contours without distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the layered LEGO bricks follow the natural curves of the sock, forming a cohesive 3D structure without gaps or misaligned layers?",
    "explanation": "Upon analysis of Image B, the LEGO bricks are stacked in such a way that they appear to follow the sock's natural curves seamlessly. The layers are tightly connected, forming a unified structure. No gaps or visible misalignments are present which would disrupt the smooth appearance of the sock shape as seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the black, gray, and white LEGO bricks arranged to match the original sock's pattern layout, including the 'UNO' text and accent stripes, without color inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the LEGO brick arrangement mirroring the color scheme and design of the original sock in Image A. The 'UNO' text and design accents are translated accurately into the brick medium, with no visible color mismatches. This reflects the fidelity to the original pattern layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the orange LEGO piece positioned at the top of the cuff and integrated into the brick structure without floating or unnatural attachment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the orange LEGO piece is incorporated at the top of the cuff, matching the tag placement on the sock in Image A. It appears to be securely connected to the rest of the structure without floating or seeming unnaturally attached, maintaining cohesion with the rest of the LEGO sculpture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sculpture presented upright against a clean, uniform background with even lighting that highlights its 3D form without casting unnatural shadows or reflections?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the sculpture in an upright position against a clean, uniformly lit background, similar to a gallery-style presentation. The lighting is even and does not introduce unrealistic shadows or reflections, allowing the LEGO sculpture's dimensions and details to be highlighted effectively.",
    "answer": "Yes"
