    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the right-side skier maintain a natural texture and appearance without visible artifacts where he appears to slide out of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skier is seamlessly integrated into the scene with the sliding effect from the frame. The jacket, backpack, and other gear maintain realistic textures and colors with no visible distortion or digital artifacts at the boundary where the skier transitions from inside the framed picture to outside. This suggests careful editing to maintain the natural appearance of the skier.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the right-side skier's body and equipment preserved, avoiding any distortion or unnatural bending in the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body posture and equipment, such as ski poles and skis, of the right-side skier in Image B seem accurately represented with no noticeable distortions. The limbs and gear maintain their proper proportions, reflecting dynamic motion consistent with skiing, aligning with expectations for a scenario involving high-speed skiing on a slope.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shadow cast by the right-side skier remain consistent with the light source and appear naturally elongated or altered appropriately due to the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadow of the skier falls naturally on the slope, showing appropriate length and direction given the position of the sun. The light source, indicated by the sun in the background, aligns with the shadows' direction and intensity, ensuring consistency with natural lighting conditions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the snow texture around the right-side skier smooth and uninterrupted, without showing signs of unnatural blending or disruption from the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow texture in Image B appears even and continuous around the skier, with the powder being kicked up naturally due to the skier's motion. There are no signs of digital blending or disruption, maintaining the realistic appearance of fresh, untouched snow that is coherent with the skier's interaction with the snow surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the details on the right-side skier's clothing, ski poles, and skis remain sharp and clear, without any blurring or loss of detail due to the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skier's clothing, such as the jacket and backpack, along with equipment like ski poles and skis, are rendered with clear details. The fabric texture, logos, and metallic shine are sharply defined, indicating meticulous attention to preserving detail during the editing process, maintaining clarity despite the dynamic scene.",
