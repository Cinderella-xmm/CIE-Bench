      "question": "Are the facial features and body proportions of the central figure preserved and undistorted despite the artistic transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall body proportions of the central figure appear consistent with general human anatomy. The shoulders, neck, and arms are accurately depicted, maintaining correct proportion regardless of artistic changes in style. Comparing these aspects with Image A confirms the preservation of these proportions without distortion resulting from the transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added Maasai motifs on the blue garment aligned with the fabric's folds and free from jagged edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Maasai motifs exhibit a pattern design consistent with traditional Maasai style and are incorporated into the clothing in Image B. The motifs follow the contour of the fabric seamlessly, as evidenced by smooth integration in the garment's appearance, without any obvious disruptions, jagged edges or broken lines between pattern segments. Image A lacks these motifs for comparison, but the incorporation in Image B is articulate and complete.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements on the bead ornaments emit light in a controlled manner without creating halos or color bleed onto the skin or fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bead ornaments present a glow which maintains a contained and controlled luminescence, contributing to the striking visual appeal. This glow does not spill over in the form of halos or color bleed onto adjacent areas such as the skin or fabric, highlighting expertise in their rendering. Comparison is not possible as Image A lacks glowing elements, but Image B succeeds in maintaining visual clarity and control.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the brush strokes in the background evenly applied and do they preserve the correct shapes and positions of trees, terrain, and horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, brush strokes build a vibrant, expressive background that does not disrupt the natural composition. The trees, terrain, and horizon maintain their expected positions and forms, with the artistic application of brush strokes contributing to the vivid atmosphere rather than distorting it. Although a comparison between Image A and B shows stylistic differences, Image B ensures coherence and continuity in its painted landscape and elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bead ornaments on the neck, arms, and headpiece fully intact with no missing, duplicated, or warped segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bead ornaments in Image B retain integrity, with tight and consistent alignment. Inspection reveals detailed craftsmanship, avoiding any issues like missing segments or duplication. The accuracy of placement and form suggests careful adaptation, contributing to the artisanal representation. Image A provides a basis seen without these alterations, confirming the intact depiction in Image B.",
