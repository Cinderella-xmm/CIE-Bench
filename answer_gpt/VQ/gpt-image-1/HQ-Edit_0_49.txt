    "Question": "Q1: Is the teapot proportionally scaled down while maintaining its original shape, surface details, and structural coherence?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is placed under a glass dome with small porcelain cups around it, suggesting its scaled-down nature. Despite the size reduction, it retains all the original detailing of its ornate design, demonstrating an accurate proportional scaling. The consistency in shape and styling indicates it retains the structural coherence from its larger version.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the porcelain cups arranged around the base in a balanced, non-overlapping manner, and do they appear to be made of realistic ceramic material with appropriate reflections and shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the porcelain cups are placed evenly around the base of the glass dome with no overlapping, highlighting symmetry and balance in their arrangement. Each cup has a glossy finish that reflects light similar to a ceramic material, casting realistic shadows consistent with the lighting in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the new engravings on the elevated surface match the existing decorative patterns in style and depth, without appearing pixelated, duplicated, or unnaturally enhanced?",
    "explanation": "The teapot in Image B, although scaled down, exhibits detailed engravings consistent with classic ornate metallic designs. The depth and style are uniform, and the images do not show signs of pixelation or unnatural enhancements. The engravings blend seamlessly with the rest of the teapot's patterns.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the steam spirals rise smoothly from the teapotâ€™s spout and lid area, exhibiting soft edges, proper translucency, and consistent lighting interaction?",
    "explanation": "The steam spirals depicted in Image B above the teapot have smoothly transition from the spout and lid, with gentle curves and soft edges. The translucency is appropriate, allowing for a realistic interaction with the light in the environment, contributing to the visual effect of warm steam emanating from the pot.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the glass dome show accurate light refraction and surface reflections, allowing clear visibility of the teapot and surrounding elements without visual distortion or artificial glare?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B displays realistic properties of glass, such as accurate refraction and natural reflections. The teapot and cups within are clearly visible without distortion, and there is no artificial glare that would detract from observing the objects beneath the dome. This clarity facilitates the perceived realism of the setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
