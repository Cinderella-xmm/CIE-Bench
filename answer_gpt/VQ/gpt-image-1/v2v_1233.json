      "question": "Does the transition from the realistic depiction of the patient to the pop-art comic design appear smooth without introducing unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition sees the realistic depiction replaced by bold colors, halftone patterns, and simplified lines common in pop-art comics. These features appear deliberately stylized, aligning with comic design expectations, without introducing unintended artifacts like pixelation or distortion. The visual transformation maintains consistency in its artistic theme rather than falling into disharmony or quality degradation, suggesting awareness in design alteration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the halftone patterns and bold graphical details added to the image consistent with the rest of the scene and do not look out of place or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, halftone patterns and bold lines characteristic of the pop-art comic style cover the entire scene uniformlyâ€”prominent in the background, patient attire, and medical equipment. This stylistic choice is consistent throughout the image, supporting a cohesive artistic presentation. There is no evident visual distortion, as these features are a standard element of the comic aesthetic and deliberately applied to enhance thematic continuity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the core elements like the IV stand, monitors, and nurse retain their structural integrity and remain visually credible within the pop-art comic design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows that despite stylistic changes, the core elements like the IV stand, medical monitors, and nurse retain recognizable shapes and proportions. Their representation in pop-art style remains structurally accurate, supporting their visual credibility. While simplified and stylized, they do not deviate from expected configurations, maintaining user comprehension and element functionality despite the artistic context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the shapes of objects such as the bed, pillows, and medical equipment been preserved without distortion or damage in the pop-art comic design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The objects in Image B, including the bed, pillows, and medical gear, maintain their basic shapes and features, though altered for comic effect. The transition involves their stylistic simplification, yet they retain original shapes and proportions, ensuring structural fidelity. This unchanged structural integrity within the new artistic style indicates an intact representation absent of distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the patient's facial features and the nurse's uniform preserved without loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts in the pop-art comic design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that fine details like facial features closely adhering to specifics could be intentionally blurred or generalized throughout the edit, which is typical in the pop-art style, focusing on broader strokes rather than minute detail. However, details such as the nurse's uniform, while simplified in color and line, are clear without unintended artifact introduction. This preservation of intent maintains stylistic harmony rather than an unintended artifact appearance.",
