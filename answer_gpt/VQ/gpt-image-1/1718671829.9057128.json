      "question": "Are the wooden beams and roof supports rendered as consistent geometric shapes with sharp, clean edges and no warped or fractured sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is an art illustration with geometric shapes. The wooden beams and roof supports are depicted as consistent structures with sharp, clean edges, typical of art deco or modern illustration styles. The lines are bold and angular, forming clear geometric patterns, which emphasizes precision, suggesting there are no warped or fractured sections.",

      "question": "Is the moon a perfectly round shape with a smooth surface and uniform glow around its edge, without jagged outlines or uneven brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is depicted as a circle consistent with the style of geometric illustrations. It appears as a uniformly colored disc without texture to suggest craters or uneven brightness. The transition between the moon and its glow is smooth, characteristic of stylized artwork.",

      "question": "Are the plants in the foreground and background arranged in symmetrical, repeating patterns without irregular spacing or fragmented shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plants in Image B are depicted with symmetrical, repeating patterns, fitting into the overall geometric and stylized design of the image. They appear orderly and evenly spaced, matching the symmetrical nature of illustrative design without irregular or fragmented shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the wooden surfaces and glass panes display metallic gold and silver accents with consistent sheen and reflection, without color bleeding or missing texture details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a color palette dominated by metallic gold and silver-like tones. These colors are used throughout the image on wood and glass surfaces, offering a stylized sheen that is consistent across the image. The illustration style focuses on flat, consistent color application, avoiding color bleeding or missing texture details typically seen in more realistic images.",

      "question": "Are the stylized clouds positioned above the horizon with smooth, flowing outlines and do the window frames show bold, angular lines that align with the architectural style without breaking the windowâ€™s structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are depicted with smooth, flowing outlines above the horizon, aligning with the stylized, geometric representation. The window frames are drawn with bold, angular lines characteristic of the illustration's overall style. This ensures the structural integrity of the windows is maintained as there are no breaks in their outline.",
