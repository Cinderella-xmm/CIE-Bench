    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head proportionally enlarged but still geometrically consistent with the neck and shoulders, without unnatural stretching or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head is stylized, reflecting a chibi or cartoon style which commonly features enlarged heads while ensuring proportional consistency with the body parts they connect, like the neck and shoulders. World knowledge about chibi style suggests that this is typical, and visually, the head does align well with the neck and shoulders.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the body, dress, and hair uniformly rendered with a soft rubber texture, free from conflicting textures or glossy reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized keychain where the surfaces appear to have a matte texture typical of soft rubber, without any glossy reflections. Observing the consistent matte finish throughout indicates uniformity in texture choice.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red boots and lace dress clearly identifiable with preserved structural details such as buckles, stitching, and knit patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While structural details like buckles and patterns are simplified in Image B, the key features of red boots and a lace dress are identifiable. The reduced complexity in design is typical in rendering for such stylized representations, where details may be minimized but remain recognizable.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bent posture maintain anatomical alignment of the spine, hips, and knees without unnatural angles or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite being stylized, the posture maintains an appropriate anatomical alignment. The simplified cartoon form keeps the proportions and bend of spine, hips, and knees consistent without introducing unnatural angles or segment separations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the silver keyring visibly connected to the character without gaps or overlapping edges, and does the wooden plank background show consistent texture and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silver keyring is clearly attached to the character with no gaps or overlaps visible, fitting the depiction of a functional keychain. The wooden plank surface underneath displays consistent wood texture and plank spacing, which fits the realistic representation of wood.",
