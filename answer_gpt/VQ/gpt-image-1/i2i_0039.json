      "question": "Are the polar bears fully intact, with their proportions and textures appearing natural and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the polar bears are visually coherent. Their proportions and textures appear natural, without signs of distortion or unnatural modifications. The bears are positioned on an ice surface, and their form aligns with typical representations of polar bears in polar environments. Image A supports this observation as the same visual integrity and proportions are maintained in both images.",

      "question": "Does the cooled color tone appear seamlessly integrated into the environment, avoiding unnatural color gradients or patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cooled color tone creates a more subdued and cooler visual impact, emphasizing the cold and stark environment. This visual shift aligns with typical polar scenes, where hues are muted to reflect the chilly atmosphere. The transition into the cooler tones appears smooth, without harsh gradients or visible patches, enhancing the cohesion of the scene.",

      "question": "Is the bold headline \"Only Ice Left. Nowhere to Go.\" free of jagged edges or pixelation and does not obscure important details of the ice and bears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The headline in Image B is clear and visually smooth, with well-defined edges and no signs of pixelation. Positioned strategically at the top and bottom, it avoids overlapping the polar bears and does not obscure significant details of the ice landscape. This arrangement ensures the visual elements and the message do not interfere with each other.",

      "question": "Are the organization logo and website at the bottom legible yet unobtrusive, ensuring they do not interfere with the depiction of the ice and bears?",

      "question": "Does the combination of the modified image elements, including the text and logo, uphold a realistic and coherent style without creating any visually confusing elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B includes text elements, there is no organization logo. The text presented upholds a clear message that integrates smoothly into the image style, maintaining realism and coherence. It emphasizes the theme without introducing confusion or conflict among visual components.",
