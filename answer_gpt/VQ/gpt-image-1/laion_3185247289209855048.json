      "question": "Does the gold wavy hair enamel pin on the head have smooth, continuous curves without jagged edges or distorted proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold wavy hair enamel pin is designed with smooth and continuous curves representing stylized hair waves. The visual cues suggest that there are no jagged edges or distorted proportions in the pin design. This reflects the typical design elements used in enamel pins that emphasize clarity and smoothness.",

      "question": "Is the pink fur-textured enamel pin on the shoulder rendered with a consistent glossy finish and no visible fibrous or organic texture that contradicts its intended material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the pink fur-textured enamel pin designed to mimic a stylized fur effect. It maintains a consistent glossy finish throughout, common for enamel pins, which are not meant to replicate fibrous or organic textures. Therefore, the pin accurately portrays a simplified version of what fur might appear to be.",

      "question": "Are the lines of the minimalist outline enamel pin complete, evenly spaced, and free from broken segments or irregular curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the minimalist outline enamel pin has lines that are evenly spaced and free from broken segments. The curvature appears regular, supported by the precise nature typically found in enamel pin designs where clean and complete outlines are prioritized.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all three enamel pins exhibit consistent glossiness and color intensity without visible noise, halos, or uneven shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each enamel pin—gold for hair, pink for the shoulder fur effect, and the minimalist outline—shows consistent glossiness and color intensity. The design does not display signs of noise, halos, or uneven shading, which aligns with the characteristics of high-quality enamel pins.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the three enamel pins positioned such that they appear to rest on the subject’s head and shoulder without intersecting through skin or appearing detached from the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays three enamel pins situated correctly on what appears to be a silhouette representation of a head and shoulder. They are positioned in a way that they appear as decorative elements resting naturally on the silhouette, without intersecting through skin or appearing detached, which is typical for enamel pins illustrated to complement an overall design layout.",
