    "Question": "Q1: Are the spectacles positioned correctly over the bear’s eyes without deforming the surrounding fur or causing unnatural lens reflections?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the bear's face area is blurred, making it impossible to discern spectacles over its eyes. Thus, this question does not apply as there is no visible evidence of spectacles in the image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the bear’s facial expression show subtle aging features (like wrinkles) without distorting the nose, mouth, or jawline geometry?",
    "explanation": "The facial area is blurred in Image B, which prevents viewing any aging features such as wrinkles or assessing whether facial geometry is distorted. Therefore, the question is not applicable.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the speech bubble clearly connected to the bear’s mouth and does it not obscure or distort nearby fur or water details?",
    "explanation": "The speech bubble is well-positioned next to the bear, indicating it is coming from the bear. It does not appear to distort nearby fur or water elements, suggesting it was integrated thoughtfully into the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the transformation chart fit naturally within the bear’s mouth without exceeding jaw limits or causing visible deformations in the mouth structure?",
    "explanation": "This question involves the transformation chart fitting into the bear's mouth, but the chart is not located in the bear's mouth in Image B. The transformation chart is in the lower part of the image along the river with no connection to the bear’s jaw area.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the labeled stages in the transformation chart aligned with the river surface and do they cast appropriate shadows or depth cues consistent with the scene?",
    "explanation": "The transformation chart is well-integrated into the scene, showing labeled stages aligned horizontally near the river. It follows the surface contours without causing any inconsistencies in lighting or shadows.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the fact box positioned in an open area of the image (e.g., near the riverbank) without covering important details like tree trunks or water flow?",
    "explanation": "The fact box in Image B is positioned in an open area toward the bottom, left-hand side of the scene, allowing for text visibility without covering critical scene details like tree trunks or water flow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the text in the speech bubble and fact box rendered with clean edges and no pixelation or aliasing artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Upon examination, the text in both the speech bubble and fact box is clear, with no visible pixelation or aliasing artifacts, ensuring legibility within the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Do the blue hues in the transformation chart and the brown-green tones in the forest background match the original image’s color grading without noticeable shifts?",
    "explanation": "The colors in Image B show consistency with the forest theme, maintaining the same brown-green tones and blue hues, which blend well with the overall color grading similar to Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q9: Are the bear’s fur strands and water splashes still visible and detailed around the added speech bubble and transformation chart?",
    "explanation": "The bear's body, fur strands, and water splashes maintain their detail despite additions like the speech bubble; the added elements do not obscure sharpness in these areas.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q10: Do both panels occupy their intended regions within the 16:9 frame without cutting off the bear’s legs or the tree line at the edges?",
    "explanation": "The panels in Image B are structured to fit within the intended frame, preserving continuity without cuts affecting the bear’s legs or the tree line—a typical practice ensuring the image fits expressively on screen.",
    "answer": "Yes"
