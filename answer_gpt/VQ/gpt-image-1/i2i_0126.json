      "question": "Are the proportions of both characters consistent and free from distortion in their respective views within the combined illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image, the characters are depicted realistically with appropriate proportions in their standing or sitting postures. The clothes, body shapes, and seated positions seem consistent and are proportionate without any visible distortion. In the composite illustration, the characters appear consistently drawn and proportioned between the top and bottom panels. This consistency suggests a natural portrayal of the characters within the scene.",

      "question": "Do the textures of the office elements such as chairs, plants, and desks appear natural and retain fine details without obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the office elements like the chairs, plants, and desks are rendered with clean lines and smooth surfaces. These objects retain clarity and sharpness, suggesting attention to detail in rendering these textures. The chairs have smooth surfaces and defined edges, the plants show defined leaves, and the desks have a uniform surface without artifacts, giving an overall impression of a well-drawn office setting.",

      "question": "Are the computer screens realistic with sharp images, and does the interaction between the characters and screens appear natural without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the computer screens show clear images of other characters as if simulating a video call. The interaction between the characters and the screens appears realistic, with the characters naturally positioned in front of their screens. The lack of visible artifacts and the clarity of the screen images contribute to the realistic portrayal of this interaction.",

      "question": "Do the characters align correctly with their environment, maintaining a plausible spatial relationship and avoiding any broken geometric shapes or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the composite illustration, the characters align well with their environment. Both characters are positioned correctly in relation to the desks, chairs, and other office elements. Their body posture and seating positions maintain a realistic spatial relationship with the objects around them. There are no broken geometric shapes or visible misalignments that would disrupt the natural setup of the office space.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting, including the hanging lampâ€™s shadow and the light on the characters, maintain consistency and contribute to the natural appearance of the scene without unnatural contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows consistent lighting throughout the scene. The hanging lamp casts a realistic shadow, and the lighting on the characters is consistent with the direction of light suggested by the surrounding shadows. This consistency helps maintain a natural appearance, avoiding harsh or unnatural contrasts between light and dark areas.",
