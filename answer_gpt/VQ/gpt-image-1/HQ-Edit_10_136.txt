    "Question": "Q1: Does the enlarged strumming hand have five fingers with natural joint alignment and ergonomic shape, without any extra digits or unnatural bending?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the guitar appears exaggerated in size, and it seems to have only three fingers visible, with a cartoonish simplification characteristic of the style. This intentional artistic choice leans towards a visual style where accuracy of anatomy is not strictly observed, thus doesn't display the natural joint alignment or a realistic ergonomic shape of a typical human hand.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the edges of the girlâ€™s face, hair, and clothing smoothly integrated into the cartoon style without jagged lines, pixelation, or inconsistent shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon style is consistent across the girl's face, hair, and clothing. The lines appear smooth and rounded, reflective of hand-drawn illustrations. This style naturally involves uniform coloring and smooth lines that define shapes without pixelation or jagged edges, thus integrating well into the illustrative style.",

    "Question": "Q3: Do the watercolor band logos on the wall have soft brushstroke textures and natural color gradients without sharp digital edges or unnatural color bleeding?",
    "explanation": "The band logos on the wall in Image B mimic watercolor textures by using soft, rounded shapes and muted color transitions that lack sharp digital edges. The use of colors in flat areas with controlled shading tones contributes to the painted appearance without unnatural color bleeding, maintaining the visual style of watercolor.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the cat silhouette positioned on the bed without overlapping the edge of the blanket or pillow, and does it have smooth, non-jagged edges with a uniform pastel fill?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat silhouette is placed on the bed in a manner that respects the boundary of surrounding objects, allowing for distinct separation from the edge of the blanket or pillow. The edges are smooth, and the fill is uniform in a pastel tone befitting the overall color scheme, avoiding jaggedness.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the writing box proportionally sized relative to the stool, and does it cast a subtle shadow consistent with the room's lighting direction without appearing floating or detached?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the writing box sits appropriately in size when compared to the nearby stool. The subtle shadow underneath aligns with the lighting direction present in the room, produced by light streaming through the window, making the box appear grounded rather than floating. This consistency in light and proportion maintains the image's visual coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
