    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all spherical and cubic elements converted into LEGO brick shapes with consistent rectangular prismatic geometry, preserving structural integrity and avoiding warped or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements are indeed transformed into LEGO brick shapes, which are characterized by their consistent rectangular prismatic geometry typical of standard LEGO blocks. Each block has a clearly defined shape, with straight edges and corners, showing no signs of warping or breaking. This structured transformation reflects a stable and intact modification from the original forms in Image A, which were more spherical and cubic in nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the transformed LEGO bricks exhibit a uniform matte surface finish without specular highlights or reflections that contradict the intended LEGO material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the LEGO bricks with a surface finish that appears to be matte and consistent with typical LEGO blocks. There are no specular highlights or reflections that would suggest a glossy or shiny surface, which aligns with the standard material appearance of traditional LEGO bricks, known for their slightly textured and matte-like finish.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible, proportionally accurate interlocking features (e.g., studs or recesses) on the tops and sides of the LEGO bricks that match standard LEGO design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the transformed LEGO bricks show interlocking features such as studs on the tops of the blocks. These studs are in proportion and spaced in a manner consistent with traditional LEGO design, which facilitates the bricks' interlocking functionality. This adherence to the design standards of LEGO blocks confirms their transformation from the original spherical and cubic elements into functional LEGO-like structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all LEGO bricks arranged in a stable, grounded formation on a wooden shelf surface, with no floating or suspended pieces that defy gravity or spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all LEGO bricks are depicted as arranged in a stable and grounded manner on a wooden shelf. Each brick appears securely placed on the shelves without any indication of floating or suspending that would contradict natural physical laws. Such an arrangement ensures the spatial logic and physical integrity of the setup, which is typical for displaying objects in reality.",

      "question": "Is the background uniformly simplified into a clean, neutral tone without any residual textures, shadows, or depth cues that conflict with the minimalist intent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is uniformly and minimally presented, with a simple neutral tone that has no visible textures, shadows, or depth cues. This simplification contributes to the minimalist effect, ensuring that all focus remains on the LEGO bricks while avoiding any distractions or visual noise. This consistent backdrop supports the edited image's intent of showcasing a clean and streamlined aesthetic.",
