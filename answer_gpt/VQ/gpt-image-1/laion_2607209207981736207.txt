    "Question": "Q1: Does the metallic texture applied to the scanner's body exhibit consistent highlights and reflections that align with the light source direction, avoiding patchy or overly shiny areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scanner's body features a sleek metallic texture. To determine if the highlights and reflections align with the light source, we examine areas where light naturally falls, such as the top and sides of the scanner. Consistent highlights indicate a smooth surface without patchiness. The edited image shows even reflections, which suggests a realistic portrayal of metallic texture under light. The smooth transition of tones on the scanner reflects a careful application of textures that do not result in distracting or unrealistic shininess.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the holographic display integrated into the front panel with translucent edges and layered visual depth, maintaining alignment with the scanner’s shape and not appearing as a simple 2D overlay?",
    "explanation": "The holographic display in Image B is supposed to give an impression of advanced technology seamlessly integrated into the scanner's design. Observing its alignment with the scanner’s curvature and the incorporation of layered visuals, the display appears embedded into the device's surface rather than merely added externally. Such integration is achieved by ensuring proportions and transparency edges align with the device's contours. Its layered depth and appropriately translucent edges maintain the perception that it is part of the scanner rather than a flat overlay, enhancing the futuristic aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the grid lines evenly spaced and aligned with the orientation of the device, forming continuous patterns without jagged edges or interruptions that suggest digital artifacting?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing the grid lines in Image B, they're inspected for uniform spacing and alignment with the device's orientation. Continuous and smooth lines suggest careful digital rendering, avoiding artifacting. When composed correctly, grid lines reflect precision—maintaining constant distances and seamless continuity across the surface of the packaging. The absence of jagged or irregular edges indicates sophisticated graphic design. Thus, the grid lines are evaluated to be well-rendered and appropriately aligned.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the tech-themed icons and branding clearly legible, properly scaled, and positioned in non-intrusive areas such as the lower corners or sides, without overlapping critical components like the control panel or paper path?",
    "explanation": "In the packaging design of Image B, branding and icons are strategic in placement to avoid interfering with functional elements of the scanner. By assessing the positioning relative to the panel and paper feed areas, icons should enhance but not impede usability. Scale and legibility are essential for user understanding without clutter. In Image B, branding elements are positioned in less critical areas like corners, maintaining clear margins around operational sections like control buttons and paper paths, confirming thoughtful design choices.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the transformed packaging retain the same overall dimensions and spatial relationships between components (e.g., paper feed slot, control panel area) as the original scanner, preventing distortion or misalignment of key parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, evaluating the consistency of dimensions and spatial arrangements involves comparing the layout of functional parts, such as the control panel and paper feed slot, with Image A. While the packaging design showcases futuristic enhancements, core components retain positions reminiscent of Image A's device structure, preventing distortion. Such consistency ensures operational familiarity and emphasizes realistic transformation over superficial alteration. The spatial relationship is maintained, supporting usability.",
    "answer": "Yes"
