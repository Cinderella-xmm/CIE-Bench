    "Question": "Q3: Are the silhouettes of the explorers clearly distinguishable, proportionally small relative to the map scale, and placed along plausible travel paths without overlapping key geographical labels?",
    "explanation": "The explorers in Image B are presented as silhouettes which, while smaller relative to the map itself, maintain discernible shapes with no significant distortion. They appear to be walking along logical paths guided by the map’s context, aligning with historical exploration routes, and do not interfere with or obscure significant map details like labels or outlines of countries.",

    "Question": "Q5: Do the red dotted lines form continuous, non-overlapping paths across the map that align with known historical exploration routes and avoid cutting through landmasses or key symbols?",
    "explanation": "The red dotted lines in Image B form coherent paths that weave through the map without overlapping excessively or crossing through the land masses inappropriately. This presentation aligns with expected exploration routes used in historical map depictions, maintaining an organized pathway that respects the map’s geographical layout and avoids any obstruction of key map features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
