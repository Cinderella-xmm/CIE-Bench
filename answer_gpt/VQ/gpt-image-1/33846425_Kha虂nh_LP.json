      "question": "Does the enlarged skirt maintain consistent lace texture and pattern without visible warping, tiling, or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skirt appears to maintain a consistent lace texture and pattern, which suggests an attention to detail in preserving the fabric's realistic appearance. There is no visible warping, tiling, or unnatural stretching, indicating a careful and precise editing process that aligns the lace design with a natural flow and continuity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the enhanced lace details consistent in thickness, spacing, and opacity with the original lace, and do they lack abrupt edges or synthetic-looking overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lace details in Image B remain consistent in thickness, spacing, and opacity, matching the original lace appearance seen in Image A. The lace in both images does not exhibit abrupt edges or appear synthetic, suggesting that the enhancement maintains the authentic look of the fabric.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the added structural elements of the camper van conversion (e.g., side panels, windows) follow the car’s existing geometry and maintain consistent scale and perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image B undergoes stylistic transformation, resembling a drawing or sketch. While specific structural modifications for a camper van conversion are not explicitly depicted, the scale and perspective of the vehicle remain consistent with its form. The changes align with the stylized nature step without geometrical deviations from the car's original shape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral paintings on the car in Image B are applied smoothly, adapting to the vehicle's curved surfaces without appearing flat, misaligned, or improperly shadowed. The integration of these elements appears natural and harmonious with the car's form and lighting, maintaining aesthetic consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the kraft paper texture uniformly applied across the background without obscuring the subject or creating visible seams, and are the nautical borders contained within the image boundaries without cutting into the woman or car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kraft paper texture is applied uniformly across the background, enhancing the artistic look without obscuring the main subjects. The nautical borders are well-contained within the boundaries of the image, carefully avoiding any overlap or intrusion onto the woman or car.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains consistent lighting and shadows that align with the original sunlight source. The shading on the woman's dress, car, and additional elements complements the implied light direction without introducing conflicting highlights or dark areas, supporting a cohesive visual effect.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the woman's right hand with five distinct fingers, natural joint angles, and texture that aligns with the rest of the edited image's artistic style. Her foot positioning and sandal alignment appear correct, lacking any deformation or unnatural angles, ensuring consistency in her portrayal.",
