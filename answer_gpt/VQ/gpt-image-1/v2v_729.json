      "question": "Does the circular badge appear seamlessly integrated into the scene without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular badge in Image B is shown being held by a hand, and it appears to fit naturally in this position with no apparent visual artifacts or issues in the textures. The design elements inside the badge, like the Statue of Liberty, London Eye, and Eiffel Tower, are smoothly encompassed within the circular border, maintaining a coherent and intentional design aesthetic. There are no visible inconsistencies in the integration with the scene, such as harsh edges or color mismatches, indicating careful editing.",

      "question": "Are the fingers of the hand holding the badge correctly shaped and detailed, without any unnatural deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the circular badge displays fingers that are anatomically plausible and well-detailed. The fingertips are rounded and the joints are smoothly articulated, suggesting a realistic depiction without any strange bending or irregular shapes. The natural grip on the badge and the position of the thumb provide additional reassurance of accurate and detailed portrayal of the hand.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the features of the Statue of Liberty, Eiffel Tower, and London Eye on the badge retain their recognizable shapes and proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The badge in Image B successfully miniaturizes the Statue of Liberty, Eiffel Tower, and London Eye into smaller, stylized forms while maintaining their iconic features and proportions. Despite the stylization required to fit these landmarks into the round badge, each element retains key characteristics that make them instantly recognizable. For instance, the torch and crown of the Statue of Liberty, the lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower, and the distinctive circular design of the London Eye are all accurately represented.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the addition of the badge preserve the structural consistency of the surrounding landmarks, without causing any visual disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the badge is a separate entity and does not interfere with the structural integrity of the landmarks depicted within it. These landmarks, while miniaturized and stylized to fit the badge’s format, remain visually consistent with their real-world counterparts as they are meant to evoke rather than mimic reality. The placement and visibility of these features within the badge do not visually disrupt their individual perception, maintaining consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the tassels on the badge depicted with natural textures and details, contributing to the overall visual quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tassels on the badge are illustrated with attention to detail, showcasing individual strands and a realistic fall due to gravity, which contributes positively to the tactile quality of the badge. This natural depiction enhances the badge’s credibility as a tangible object, reflecting sophisticated artistic rendering suitable at this scale, underlying a high level of visual quality consistent with the rest of the image.",
