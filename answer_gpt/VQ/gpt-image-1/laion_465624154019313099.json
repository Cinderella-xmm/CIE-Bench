      "question": "Are the eyes added to the cake positioned naturally on the surface without distorting the shape or texture of the meringue domes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are illustrated on the cake's surface with a clean and cartoonish aesthetic, which matches the general art style of the image. The shape and texture of the meringue domes are not distorted by the addition of these features, which are designed to fit naturally within the surface space of the cake.",

      "question": "Do the strawberries retain their original shape and size when repurposed as a hat, without any visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The strawberries in Image B are repurposed as a hat on the cake character and are depicted in a cartoon style that simplifies and exaggerates their shape. Despite being stylized, they maintain a consistent shape and size that suggests they weren't unnaturally warped or stretched to fit the head.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the faint silhouettes of utensils in the background visually consistent with the lighting and depth of the scene, without introducing harsh edges or unnatural shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouettes of utensils in the background of Image B are softly integrated into the scene. They are subtly placed with consideration for depth and lighting, maintaining a consistent art style without harsh edges or shadows that would seem out of place in a cartoon setting.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the strawberries and garnishes arranged around the cake in a way that maintains structural balance and does not overlap or distort the cake’s base or side layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the strawberries are creatively utilized as part of the cake's design, and no additional garnishes are visibly interfering with the structure, base, or side layers. Thus, the structural balance is maintained since the setup is cohesive within the bounds of the scene's cartoonish logic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the depiction of the cake shaking its head maintain the rigidity of the cake’s structure without suggesting unnatural flexing or bending of the layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the cake animatedly shaking its head, which is an artistic expression typical of cartoons where the original rigidity can be temporarily flexible. However, within this art style, there's no implication of the cake's real-world layers bending; it's a metaphorical depiction, maintaining the character's integrity.",
