    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the golden title banner positioned at the top of the image without overlapping or distorting the cat’s head or the window frame, and does it have a natural metallic sheen that matches the ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden title banner is located at the top of the image, above the cat's head and the window frame. It does not overlap or distort the cat's head or the window frame, as it is clearly placed in its own space. The sheen on the banner appears metallic and consistent with the ambient light, suggesting an appropriate rendering that matches the overall image style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the nameplate located at the bottom of the image without intersecting or deforming the cat’s tail or the wooden floor, and does it have clean edges and consistent material texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nameplate can be seen at the bottom of the image, below the cat's tail and above the wooden floor. It does not intersect or deform any part of the cat’s tail or the floor. The edges of the nameplate are clean and the texture is consistent, matching the rest of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the stat bars clearly visible and positioned without overlapping the cat’s fur or the window, and do they use a font and color scheme that match the overall polished, soft 3D art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stat bars are clearly visible and positioned on the image without overlapping the cat’s fur or the window. They are placed strategically below the title banner and above the nameplate. The font and color scheme of the stat bars harmonize with the overall polished and soft 3D art style of the image, which includes smooth textures and complementary colors corresponding to the environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the metallic trim form a complete, continuous border around the image without gaps, misaligned corners, or unnatural reflections that contradict the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic trim in Image B forms a continuous border around the entire image. There are no visible gaps or misaligned corners; everything lines up correctly, forming a neat rectangle. The reflections on the trim align well with the perceived lighting direction, sustaining the realism of the 3D styled image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall image rendered in a consistent semi-realistic 3D style where the cat’s fur, window details, and added elements like the banner and stat bars all exhibit smooth textures and no pixelation, blurring, or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire image, including the cat's fur, window details, and added elements such as the banner and stat bars, is rendered in a semi-realistic 3D style. All components exhibit smooth textures, without any pixelation, blurring, or geometric distortions. This consistency in rendering style maintains the visual appeal and quality of the image.",
