      "question": "Does the golden butterfly appear naturally lit and integrated into the scene without disrupting the existing light sources?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden butterfly is placed above the illuminated mirror, and it benefits from the similar warm lighting that emanates from the mirror. This lighting effect makes the butterfly appear naturally lit within the scene. The integration is seamless because the butterfly's illumination does not overpower or clash with the existing light sources; instead, it complements the ambient glow from the mirror. By analyzing visual consistency with common lighting principles, the butterfly appears harmonious within the setting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the material and texture of the golden butterfly consistent with the surrounding surfaces, avoiding any visible unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden butterfly exhibits a shiny and smooth texture that matches the reflective qualities of the mirror and the metallic lighting details present in the room. The butterfly's material seems coherent with the finishes found elsewhere in the image, avoiding any jarring or unnatural textures that might disrupt the scene's aesthetic. Common knowledge of material consistency in design supports this observation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shape of the golden butterfly structurally coherent and free from distortion, maintaining proper geometry as it appears above the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the golden butterfly in a natural, symmetrical form that maintains proper geometry. The butterfly's wings are evenly shaped and properly proportioned, preserving the natural beauty associated with butterfly anatomy. The continuity of form ensures that its structure is coherent with established natural structures of butterflies.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the position of the golden butterfly above the mirror contribute positively to the overall composition without creating visual discontinuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is positioned centrally above the circular mirror, enhancing the room's symmetrical design. This placement contributes positively to the overall composition, creating a focal point without interrupting the visual flow of the room. The object's harmony with the roomâ€™s design elements and modern aesthetic ensures it integrates smoothly into the scene without disrupting the spatial balance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the golden butterfly been preserved, ensuring clarity and sharpness in comparison to the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the golden butterfly exhibits fine details, such as distinct wing patterns and textures that are clear and sharp. These details are consistent with the clarity seen throughout the image, such as the crispness of the vase and branches, ensuring that the butterfly retains visual sharpness that matches the rest of the image's quality.",
