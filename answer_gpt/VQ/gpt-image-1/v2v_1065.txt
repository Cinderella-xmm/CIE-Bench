    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi-style 3D figure maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the skateboarder's mid-action pose without distortion?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a chibi-style 3D figure inside a snow globe. Chibi characters are characterized by exaggerated features, such as larger heads and smaller bodies, creating a cute, stylized appearance. Despite these stylized proportions, the figure captures the skateboarding action pose, with limbs and skateboard positioning reflective of dynamic motion, albeit in a stylized manner fitting the chibi art form. Therefore, while technically not adhering to realistic human proportions, it is not distorted in the context of chibi proportions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the tiny palm trees and ramps inside the snow globe naturally integrated into the scene without introducing unnatural textures or broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tiny palm trees and ramps are models within the snow globe, designed to create a small-scale environment. The palm trees and ramps are smoothly integrated within the globe, showing no signs of unnatural textures or broken shapes. They mimic real-world counterparts on a reduced scale, fitting naturally with the scene's aesthetic. The absence of distorted shapes or visible defects in these miniature elements suggests good integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the character's clothing and skateboard retain their fine details and natural textures inside the snow globe?",
    "explanation": "The character in Image B within the snow globe is rendered in a smooth, stylized manner that reflects the chibi art style, where fine details and natural textures are typically simplified for stylistic purposes. While the clothing and skateboard possess clear shapes and recognizable features, they deliberately lack real-world fine detailing to maintain stylistic coherence. Hence, in the context of chibi design, they do not exhibit natural textures, but rather a simplified aesthetic.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the snow globe resting on the table near the window appear structurally consistent and visually credible with realistic light scattering effects?",
    "explanation": "The snow globe depicted in Image B is placed on a table, receiving light that scatters realistically through the glass. The reflections and glare on the surface of the globe suggest a consistent and credible structure, indicating a well-crafted design with attention to realistic lighting behavior. The visible light effects enhance the scene's believability, creating a visually appealing and structurally convincing snow globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the snow falling inside the snow globe look natural and enhance the lively atmosphere without appearing artificial or out of place?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow within the globe is depicted as small white particles evenly distributed around the character and scene inside the globe. This gives an impression of snowfall, enhancing the lively and whimsical atmosphere. The snow appears naturally integrated, not overpowering the scene or looking artificial, maintaining consistency with the overall whimsical theme inside the globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"
