      "question": "Does the lionâ€™s silhouette maintain correct anatomical proportions and smooth edge definition without visible pixelation or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is represented as a black silhouette against a bright orange sunset background. It features correct anatomical proportions typical of a lion, with a prominent mane and well-defined structure for the body, legs, and tail. The silhouette's edges are smooth without visible pixelation or distortion, which is crucial for maintaining clarity in silhouette artwork. This reflects both artistic intention and anatomical knowledge regarding the lion's form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the color transitions in the abstract gradient backdrop smooth and free from visible banding or unnatural color boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backdrop in Image B consists of a gradient transitioning from a deep orange at the bottom to a lighter shade towards the top. The gradient appears smooth, demonstrating an understanding of color theory and application in digital art. There is no visible banding or abrupt color changes, which highlights the proper rendering of gradients typically desired in artwork that simulates a natural sunset effect.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the grass textures in the foreground appear naturally lit and spatially coherent with the rest of the scene, without repeating patterns or artificial sharpness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grass in Image B is shown as silhouettes at the bottom of the image. It is consistent with the overall silhouette aesthetic, not requiring natural lighting details due to its artistic representation. The grass pattern blends well into the scene without noticeable repetition or sharpness that could detract from the visual coherence. Such design choices reflect common principles in silhouette and landscape art.",

      "question": "Are the angular acacia tree silhouettes structurally plausible and visually balanced within the composition, without broken branches or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features acacia trees as silhouettes. Their angular shapes are typical of acacia trees, with curved and umbrella-like canopies. The silhouettes are well integrated into the composition with no odd angles or broken branches, enhancing visual balance and structural plausibility within the artistic landscape setting. This reflects an understanding of acacia tree shape and construction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title text positioned above the lion without overlapping its head or body, and does it maintain legible contrast without introducing visual noise or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title text 'KING OF THE WILD' is placed above the lion's silhouette in Image B. The text does not overlap the lion, ensuring clear visibility of both the text and silhouette. It is rendered in a contrasting light color against the dark sky, which aids legibility and avoids visual noise or distortion. This placement reflects a consideration for readability and aesthetic balance in graphic design.",
