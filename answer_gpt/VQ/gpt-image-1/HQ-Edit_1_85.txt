    "Question": "Q1: Are the lace details on the blouse rendered with consistent texture and edge definition, avoiding jagged or artificial-looking patterns that break from realistic fabric behavior?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lace details on the blouse show a well-defined pattern, consistent with realistic fabric behavior. The edges and texture are smooth and precise, reflecting a good understanding of fabric design. The lace appears natural without any jagged or artificial-looking patterns that would suggest otherwise.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the enlarged violin maintain correct proportions and undistorted structural elements such as the scroll, bridge, and f-holes, without visible warping or stretching?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the violin is depicted with correct proportions and structural elements such as the scroll, bridge, and f-holes are accurately rendered. There is no visible warping or stretching, indicating a careful representation of the instrument's geometry and design which aligns with the common understanding of a violin's structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the fingers on both hands correctly positioned and shaped, with no extra digits or distorted joints, maintaining natural human anatomy?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fingers on both hands are correctly positioned and shaped, reflecting natural human anatomy. There are no extra digits or distorted joints, and the hands are depicted in a realistic manner consistent with the act of playing the violin, indicating an accurate representation of human anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the overall surface texture consistent across the image, with no mismatched areas showing sudden changes in lighting, gloss, or material quality that suggest poor layer blending?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the overall surface texture is consistent. There are no mismatched areas showing sudden changes in lighting, gloss, or material quality that suggest poor layer blending. The elements in the image share uniform properties in terms of texture and light interaction, maintaining visual coherence across the composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do all foreground elements (girl, violin, table, candlestick) maintain consistent depth and placement, avoiding floating or misplaced components that disrupt spatial logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, all foreground elements like the girl, violin, table, and candlestick are rendered with consistent depth and placement. There are no floating or misplaced components, and the spatial logic is preserved ensuring these elements fit seamlessly into the scene, reflecting a coherent and realistic spatial arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
