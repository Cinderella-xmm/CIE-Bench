      "question": "Does the chibi-style illustration of the dog retain its distinct characteristics without unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is depicted in a chibi-style with simplified and exaggerated features characteristic of such illustrations. Chibi art generally involves less emphasis on fine details, focusing more on cuteness and simplicity. The dog retains its distinct characteristics like a simplistic face and a small, rounded body. The lack of detailed textures is typical for this style and doesn't imply a loss of detail but rather a stylistic choice.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bold white outline around the illustration enhance visual clarity without disrupting structural coherence or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bold white outline in Image B serves to isolate the illustration from the background, enhancing visual clarity which is a common practice in sticker design. This outline encircles the elements uniformly without interfering with their structure or causing visual artifacts, thereby maintaining the coherence of the objects.",

      "question": "Do the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag maintain structural consistency and visual credibility in their minimalist flat design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi illustration of Image B, the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag are rendered in a flat, simplistic style, which is intentional and common in minimalist designs. Each item retains recognizable and consistent shapes and proportions that are crucial for maintaining their identity and visual credibility despite the lack of intricate detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the extension of the dog and bench slightly beyond the circular frame preserve natural appearance and avoid distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design in Image B has parts of the dog and the bench extending slightly beyond the orange circle, a common stylistic approach in graphic design to create a sense of depth and dimension. This extension is subtle and executed without distortion, thus preserving the natural appearance of the elements within the circular frame.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the transparent background maintain the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A transparent background, as seen in Image B, is typical in sticker designs as it allows the sticker to seamlessly integrate into various surfaces without having a distinct border. This enactment retains the authenticity of the sticker's appearance and enables it to naturally conform to different usages and backgrounds.",
