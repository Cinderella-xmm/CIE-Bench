    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed house maintain consistent geometric shapes without jagged edges, overlapping planes, or unnatural fragmentation that disrupts structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house is depicted using abstract geometric shapes. It features consistent geometric forms without jagged edges or overlapping planes, maintaining structural integrity in an artistic manner. The use of vibrant polygons showcases an aesthetically pleasing and cohesive design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the abstract representations of the crowd evenly distributed across their original positions without clustering or floating elements that violate spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crowd is represented by a series of abstract and uniform circular forms. They are evenly distributed across their original position with equal spacing, maintaining spatial logic without clustering or floating elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the checkered pattern applied uniformly across the entire grass surface without visible seams, inconsistent spacing, or distortion at edges near sand traps and water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The checkered pattern on the grass in Image B is applied uniformly over the entire surface with consistent spacing. The transition near sand traps and water is seamless, maintaining the pattern without distortion or inconsistencies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the prismatic shards in the water reflect the house and sky in fragmented but coherent angular segments without ghosting, blurring, or unnatural color separation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the prismatic shards in the water reflect the house and sky effectively in angular segments. The segments are coherent, showing no ghosting or blurring, and the color separation achieves an aesthetic and logically structured appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the vibrant geometric planes on the house’s facade consistently lit and shaded to match the ambient light direction, avoiding unnatural highlights or shadow mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows consistent lighting on the geometric planes, matching the ambient light direction. Shadows and highlights align well without obvious mismatches, ensuring a realistic representation of light and shade even within the abstract design.",
