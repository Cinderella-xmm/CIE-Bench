      "question": "Does the tall glass on the right display consistent pixelated and circuit-like textures across its surface without visible cracks, jagged edges, or inconsistent rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall glass is designed with pixelated textures that resemble digital or circuit-like patterns. These textures are consistently applied across the entire surface of the glass with a uniform appearance. There are no visible cracks, jagged edges, or inconsistent rendering, which suggests that the effect was applied uniformly and accurately to match a futuristic or holographic theme.",

      "question": "Are the outlines of the Sydney Opera House composed of continuous, evenly spaced neon lines that maintain the correct number and shape of the shell structures without misalignment or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sydney Opera House is depicted with neon lines that form its outline. The lines are continuous and evenly spaced, accurately representing the iconic shell structures of the building. There is no evidence of misalignment or missing segments, showing a precise and complete rendering of the structure using neon lines.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wave patterns in the water consist of uniform, repeating geometric shapes that align horizontally and vertically without overlapping irregularly or creating gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wave patterns in Image B consist of geometric shapes forming a grid-like structure. These are uniform and display a consistent pattern that aligns horizontally and vertically. The alignment is precise, and there are no overlapping irregularly or gaps, reinforcing the digital and structured aesthetic of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the beverage in the shorter glass show a consistent holographic effect with subtle layering and refraction, without distorting the shape of the ice cubes or causing unnatural transparency gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beverage in the shorter glass exhibits a holographic effect, characterized by a bright neon glow. The effect is consistent throughout, showcasing subtle layering and refraction. The ice cubes retain their distinct shape without distortion, and the transparency appears naturally graded, preserving the visual integrity of the beverage.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the two glasses aligned with the direction of the sunset lighting, and do they match the apparent position of the sun in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's lighting portrays an artificial environment with neon styling, akin to a digital or virtual space. The shadows cast by the two glasses were present in Image A, and their alignment matched the expected direction of sunset lighting. However, the completely digital rendering in Image B lacks real-world shadows due to its neon grid design.",
