    "Question": "Q1: Are the enlarged head of the boy and the shrunken birds proportionate and structurally coherent, avoiding any noticeable distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the boy's head and the birds appear exaggerated and stylized, fitting the typical 'cartoonish' or 'sticker-like' theme. This is a common design choice to create a playful and engaging visual rather than an anatomically accurate one. The head is noticeably larger relative to the body and the birds, in line with the intended art style, which does not necessarily follow natural proportions. Therefore, no distortion is perceived within this stylistic context.",

    "Question": "Q4: Do the shrunken birds retain their fine details and textures naturally, without losing clarity or appearing pixelated?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the birds are depicted in a simplified, block-color style typical of cartoon illustrations, this style intentionally omits fine details for artistic effect.
