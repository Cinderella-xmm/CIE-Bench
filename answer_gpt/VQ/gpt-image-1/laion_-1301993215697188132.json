      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the owl's head retain proper geometric proportions with a beak that aligns with the jawline and eyes that are symmetrically placed and shaped like those of a real owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's head structure seems well-composed with an appropriate alignment of the beak, jawline, and eyes. Generally, owl eyes are large, round, and symmetrical, resembling those depicted in Image B. The head proportions are typical for stylized cartoon representations, which aim to capture key characteristics of an owl while allowing for artistic interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the feathers on the cloak consistent in direction, shading, and density, and do they blend naturally with the original blue color without visible seams or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feathers on the cloak are uniformly arranged, with consistent direction and shading that integrate seamlessly with the blue color palette. The artistic design maintains a coherent texture without visible seams or pixelation. This complements the stylized nature of the illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glasses resting securely on the beak with correct reflection and shadow placement, and do they match the size and style of typical reading glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The owl does not have glasses on its beak in Image B. It appears that this feature was omitted from the design altogether, making the comparison irrelevant.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hand replaced with a wing-like structure that has logical joint placement and feather coverage, and does it lack extra fingers or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wing-like structure that replaces the hand shows logical feather articulation with joints positioned realistically for an owl. The wing lacks extra fingers or unnatural bends, presenting a natural appearance consistent with avian anatomy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the speech bubbles placed adjacent to the beak, contain legible text with contrasting colors, and do not overlap with other elements like the microphone or feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubbles are strategically placed adjacent to the owl's beak. The text inside is clear and easy to read due to the contrasting colors. The location of the speech bubbles is well-considered, ensuring they do not overlap with other key elements like the microphone or feathers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the branches extend from the background with natural tapering and bark texture, and are they positioned behind the subject without casting incorrect shadows or appearing flat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branches are depicted with a natural tapering and visible bark texture, adding depth to the illustration. They are clearly positioned in the background, and the design ensures that shadows and textures are consistent, contributing to a three-dimensional appearance.",
