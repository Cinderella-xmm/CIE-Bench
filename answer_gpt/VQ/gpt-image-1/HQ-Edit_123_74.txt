    "Question": "Q1: Is the helmet proportionally enlarged but still maintaining a coherent shape and realistic placement on the head without visible deformation or unnatural edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet is depicted in a chibi style, which often features exaggerated or disproportionate elements for aesthetic purposes. However, within this context, the helmet retains a coherent shape as it fits well on the head, aligns with the neck, and doesn't exhibit any visible deformation or unnatural edges that disrupt the visual harmony of the character. The stylization aligns with common design principles in illustrations like this, where proportionality is visually adapted.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural joint alignment and no signs of distortion, stretching, or additional digits?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing the chibi illustration style in Image B, it's common to simplify details, sometimes even reducing fingers for style. However, the visible hands in this image appear to be simplified but still exhibit the general proportions and alignment one expects from this artistic decision, even if not explicitly showing five fingers due to stylistic representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the red tones on the snowsuit vivid but still consistent with fabric texture, without appearing overly glossy, pixelated, or disconnected from the underlying material?",
    "explanation": "Image B's chibi style features bold, vivid colors typical of such cartoons. The red of the snowsuit is vibrant, enhancing the character's silhouette. While texture details are minimal due to stylistic choices, the color remains consistent without appearing too glossy or pixelated, indicating a well-executed transition from fabric representation to stylized illustration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the snow and tree outlines cleanly separated into layered shapes resembling paper cuts, without gaps, overlapping distortions, or floating fragments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the design of snow and trees follows a stylized approach that resembles paper cut-style art. This style is characterized by clean lines and separated shapes. The snow and trees are neatly layered without any visible gaps, overlapping distortions, or fragments, reflecting a clear and intentional artistic choice consistent with this style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the snowboarder's body posture aligned with the direction of the snowboard, showing balanced weight distribution and no floating limbs or impossible angles?",
    "explanation": "In the chibi-style illustration of Image B, the snowboarder's body posture is consistent with the action of snowboarding. The character's limbs and body position adhere to the direction of motion, even in the exaggerated style. The limbs are not floating unnaturally, and the angles, while simplified, still logically match the snowboard's direction, maintaining balance typical of such artwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"
