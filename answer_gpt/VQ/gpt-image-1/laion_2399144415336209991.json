      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the enhanced beads on the bride's shoulder straps evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the fabric's surface without appearing detached or unnaturally sharp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads are part of an illustrated representation. In this illustration, they are stylized as evenly spaced and continuous, following the trend of fabric embellishment seen in formal clothing designs; they appear as carefully integrated elements within the illustration, without appearing detached or unnaturally sharp. The artist has mirrored typical bead placement, lending consistency with world knowledge on bridal fashion illustrations. This stylistic choice avoids jarring visual breaks, typical in cartoon art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the enlarged lapel of the groom's suit proportionally consistent with the rest of the jacket, and does it retain a smooth edge without jagged lines or distorted angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lapel of the groom's suit is illustrated in a proportionally consistent manner relative to the rest of the jacket. The lapel appears smooth and integrated into the jacket design, following the cartoon style. This uniformity suggests that attention was paid to maintaining the integrity of the suit's design, typical of clean illustrative art without distortion or jagged lines.",

      "question": "Do the hands in the \"holding hands\" pose have five fingers each, correctly aligned joints, and natural skin texture without distortion or overlapping limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands cover a range of positions in a stylized cartoon format. Despite this artistic abstraction, each hand design still displays five fingers, a stylized representation of joint alignment, and appears without distortion or overlap. The design principles typical in cartoons respect anatomical boundaries, even in the simplified style.",

      "question": "Is the heart-shaped border fully contained around the couple without cutting into their bodies or clothing, and are the gold trim and floral engravings clearly defined without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the heart-shaped border envelops the couple fully without intersecting their figures or clothing. The gold trim and floral engravings are hallmark elements of a stylized stamp and are distinct and well-defined. These elements do not blur or misalign, adhering to typical graphic design conventions for clarity and precision.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cartoonized features of both the bride and groom uniformly stylized, with consistent line work and shading that do not clash with each other or create abrupt transitions in texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both figures are rendered with consistent cartoon styling, characterized by even line work and complementary shading techniques. There are no abrupt transitions or clashing textures, maintaining uniformity across the cartoonized representations, which is typical of cohesive artistic rendering.",
