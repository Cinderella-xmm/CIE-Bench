      "question": "Does the teapot appear naturally integrated into the scene, maintaining texture and lighting similar to the surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the teapot is placed on the table between the two chairs. It displays consistent lighting as seen on the other objects within the room, such as the furniture and decorations. The shadows and texture match the scene's overall ambiance, making it look naturally integrated. Without referring to Image A, the integration appears seamless and maintains the cohesive design of the room. It's reasonable to conclude that the teapot is integrated naturally, given that there's no noticeable discrepancy in lighting or texture.",

      "question": "Are the two porcelain cups visually coherent with the setting, showing natural porcelain material and appropriate shadows on the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cups in Image B are positioned around the teapot on the table. They exhibit realistic textures typical of porcelain and consistent shadows that reflect the lighting setup in the room. This coherence in material appearance and shadow placement suggests that the cups are well-integrated into the scene. Given these visual cues, the porcelain cups appear coherent with the setting with proper material representation and shadowing, lending to a seamless look.",

      "question": "Do the new additions (teapot and porcelain cups) fit naturally within the room's ambiance without causing any visible distortions or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot and cups are incorporated onto the table in a harmonious fashion. Their positioning does not disrupt the room's existing layout. The lighting, proportions, and colors align with the current ambiance without introducing distortions or inconsistencies. This shows that the additions maintain the aesthetic unity of the room. Given their blend and proper alignment within the atmosphere, these objects fit naturally without visible disruptions.",

      "question": "Are the teapot and porcelain cups appropriately sized and positioned on the table, maintaining proper proportions and structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot and cups appear proportionate to the table size and the surrounding furniture. Visual alignment and placement suggest thoughtful consideration of spatial relations and structural decorum. Their dimensions fit well within the scene's scale, neither overpowering nor diminishing relative to other objects. This indicates appropriate sizing and positioning with respect to the table's scale and overall room consistency.",

      "question": "Do the teapot and porcelain cups retain detailed textures and edges, ensuring they stand out clearly against the background without losing definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the teapot and cups display distinct outlines and textures. Their surfaces are clear and retain material definition, which allows them to stand out effectively against the neutral background. The lighting further enhances clear visibility of contours, ensuring crisp details without blending into the backdrop. This maintained clarity reveals defined textures and edges, affirming their visual prominence in the room.",
