      "question": "Do the anthropomorphic cardinal and blue jay have proportionally correct limbs and body structures that maintain anatomical plausibility without visible deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal and blue jay are depicted with anthropomorphic characteristics, wearing Victorian-style garments. Given that both birds appear to be standing in a human-like pose with outfits tailored to fit their new forms, their limbs and body structures need not strictly adhere to avian anatomy but should still maintain a general sense of proportionality and form. The birds exhibit proportionally plausible sizes of heads, bodies, and limbs suitable for their attire without obvious deformations or irregularities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Victorian garments worn by the cardinal and blue jay rendered with clear, consistent texture and stitching, free from pixelation, blurring, or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing on the cardinal and blue jay is depicted with detailed textures and stitching lines that mimic fabric. The garments look sharply defined with no noticeable pixelation or blurring, and the material appears consistent across different areas of fabric. The design and stitching are detailed, and the attire seems to be tailored without inconsistencies in the pattern or fabric texture.",

      "question": "Are the miniature stage and alcove elements positioned with proper depth and alignment, and do icicles and pine accents adhere to gravitational and spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stage and alcove elements are dimensionally presented with a sense of depth, while icicles appear to hang in a realistic manner adhering to gravitational pull. The pine accents decorated around both birds are placed logically according to spatial norms. Each element's depth and placement within alcoves seem to follow coherent spatial logic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all miniature seasonal elements (e.g., ornaments, snowflakes) properly scaled, cast realistic shadows, and aligned with the lighting direction of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, miniature elements like snowflakes and other seasonal decorations have appropriate scaling and cast shadows consistent with their sizes. The shadows and highlights suggest a directional light source, aligning with the lighting cues of the scene, where no unrealistic shading is evident.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the split-frame border clean and seamless, with no visible artifacts, distortion, or color bleeding at the boundary between the two scenes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not explicitly feature a split-frame border with two contrasting scenes as seen in Image A. Instead, it presents two separate alcoves containing the cardinal and blue jay individually. However, the divisions between the bird alcoves are clear with no discernible artifacts or bleeding at the border, maintaining a neat and seamless presentation.",
