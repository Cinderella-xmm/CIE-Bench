      "question": "Do the hummingbird's wings display a seamless, continuous iridescent glass-like texture with natural light reflection and rainbow color gradients, free from jagged edges or artificial-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hummingbird's wings have an iridescent glass-like texture with a smooth surface, as observed in the reflection and variety of colors that blend naturally. They appear without jagged edges, suggesting a design that aligns with light refraction principles seen in glass and rainbow phenomena. Image A shows regular wing feather textures, differing from the glass-like appearance in B. The edited image offers a seamless texture distinct from A's feathers, highlighting a transformation into an artistic design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the luminescent petals covering the hummingbird’s body arranged in a way that follows the bird’s body contours without gaps, overlaps, or unnatural spacing, and do they exhibit consistent lighting and translucency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petals conform to the bird's body in a manner that mimics natural contour flow, without displaying visible gaps or overlaps, and spread uniformly along the body. Lighting across the petals is consistent, promoting translucency and minimizing shadows. This arrangement ensures an aesthetically pleasing flow and harmony with the fantastical design of Image B. In contrast, Image A shows the bird's natural plumage without petals. The edited petals exhibit smooth integration and translucent qualities appropriate in the depicted setting.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the crystalline spout seamlessly integrated into the hummingbird’s head, with realistic internal refraction and a coherent, gravity-consistent flow of nectar emerging from its tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a crystalline spout that appears an integral part of the hummingbird's transformed head design, with internal reflections suggesting real refractive properties akin to crystal materials. The nectar flow emerges from the tip in a direction consistent with gravity, following the natural vertical descent. In Image A, nectar feeding occurs through the bird's beak without the crystalline detailing. The transformation in B achieves a seamless perspective and natural coherence in terms of material and flow behavior.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the trailing vines and blossoms extending from the hummingbird’s tail maintain natural growth patterns, with gradual tapering and evenly spaced flowers, and do they avoid appearing stiff or unnaturally rigid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vines and blossoms extend gracefully from the hummingbird's tail, showing gradual tapering and evenly spaced blooms across their length. They appear fluid and natural, avoiding any rigidity that might seem artificial. This fluidity supports the organic transformation while maintaining consistency with observed botanical growth patterns. Image A lacks such vine details altogether. Image B's floral design achieves elegant tapering matching realistic plant structure.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the transformed hummingbird cast a shadow consistent with the ambient lighting direction and intensity, and does its overall appearance harmonize with the surrounding garden elements in terms of color temperature and luminosity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed hummingbird is illuminated harmoniously with the background lighting, evident in its glowing details matching the garden's glow and warmth. Its overall color temperature and brightness blend seamlessly with the surrounding flowers, garden elements, and the ambient light source direction. The shadow, although subtle, aligns with the scene's lighting conditions, enhancing a cohesive appearance. Image A's lighting similarly shows integration. B confirms visual harmony between the hummingbird's fantasy design and garden scene.",
