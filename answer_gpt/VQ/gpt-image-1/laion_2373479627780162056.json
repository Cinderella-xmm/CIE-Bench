      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the suit jacket exhibit watercolor-style blue-black tones with smooth transitions and no visible digital artifacts such as jagged edges or unnatural blotches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit jacket displays a watercolor-style reminiscent of hand-painted artwork. The use of blue-black tones appears smooth and well-blended, featuring fluid transitions typical of watercolor painting. The absence of jagged edges or unnatural digital artifacts indicates proficient digital editing or rendering. World knowledge regarding watercolor artistic techniques, which emphasize smooth color integration without harsh lines, supports this conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the golden pinstripes aligned with the suit’s fabric grain and do they reflect light consistently with the surrounding material, avoiding floating or misaligned lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the golden pinstripes on the suit align well with the fabric's grain, indicative of lines that follow the natural contours of the jacket's material. The pinstripes' consistent light reflection implies an adherence to how light interacts uniformly across the fabric surface, without any evident floating or misalignment. Understanding of clothing design and textile properties encourages a close observation of line integration with fabric texture.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the pattern on the tie uniformly distributed, maintaining consistent size and spacing across its surface without stretching or repeating errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the tie with a consistent pattern distribution. This is evident as the pattern maintains uniformity in size and spacing, indicative of smooth digital rendering or precise artistic replication. There are no signs of stretching or repeat errors, which can usually be identified by irregular spacing or mismatched repeats in patterns, suggesting comprehensive attention to detail. Knowledge of textile and pattern design emphasizes the importance of uniformity and accurate replication in realistic portrayals.",

      "question": "Does the leather-bound border feature realistic texture details such as stitching, grain, and embossed lettering without warping or clipping the subject’s features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leather-bound border in Image B showcases realistic texture details, including visible stitching and grain. These elements contribute to a convincing portrayal of leather material which would typically include fine lines and texture variance. The absence of warping or clipping ensures the coherent integration of the subject's features with the surrounding border, suggesting precise digital artistry or rendering technique. Common knowledge about leather goods informs expertise in expecting detailed texture replication.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background and surface of the image show a soft, uniform satin paper texture with subtle reflections, avoiding harsh glare or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B highlights a soft, uniform satin paper texture, characterized by subtle reflections that mimic the natural qualities of satin-finished paper. This texture avoids any harsh glare or pixelation, which can detract from smooth visuals and indicate poor rendering. Observation of the visual background procured through highly refined digital or artistic execution aids recognition of this delicate texture portrayal. World knowledge related to print media quality standards guides understanding of ideal surface finishes.",
