      "question": "Are the stat bars positioned in a way that does not obscure key facial features or clothing details and appear visually coherent with the overall composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stat bars in Image B do not obstruct the important features of clothing or other significant visual elements. They are placed at the bottom portion of the image, integrating into the card-like design, while avoiding interference with the main visual focal points. The positioning allows the viewer to appreciate the attire and craftsmanship displayed, maintaining coherence with the theme of the image, enhancing rather than detracting from the central depiction.",

      "question": "Does the woven-texture title banner at the top have consistent thread-like patterns and natural shading, without visible warping or repeating artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title banner in Image B presents a woven-texture appearance with intricate thread-like patterns, uniform and well-designed without visual disruptions. The shading is applied naturally, enhancing the three-dimensional effect of weaving, and there are no visible repeating patterns or distortions indicative of rendering artifacts. This consistency parallels traditional craft motifs, promoting authenticity.",

      "question": "Is the gold-etched nameplate free from exaggerated glares or inconsistent surface reflections, and does it maintain a uniform thickness and edge definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's gold-etched nameplate features a balanced sheen and appropriate reflective qualities consistent with crafted metalwork. It lacks unrealistic glares or reflections that would detract from authenticity, demonstrating a continuous consistency in thickness and precise edge definition. Such qualities are expected in illustrative art that aims to replicate a luxurious or traditional metallic look.",

      "question": "Are the geometric tribal motifs along the border continuous, symmetrical, and free from gaps or distorted angles that suggest poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The geometric motifs along the border of Image B are designed to be continuous and symmetrical, maintaining a harmonious pattern without gaps or distortions. This careful rendering respects the cultural significance of tribal motifs, illustrating a strong coherence in angular precision and pattern repetition, ensuring that there is no aesthetic dissonance.",

      "question": "Do the abstracted trees and gathering figures in the background maintain logical spatial relationships and soft transitions, without abrupt edges or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the abstracted background scenes, including trees and silhouetted figures, are composed with soft transitions and logical positioning. The spatial relations between elements seem coherent, suggesting depth and contextual interaction typical of group settings. There are no abrupt edges or misplaced components, ensuring the background complements the foreground without introducing visual distractions.",
