    "Question": "Q1: Is the transparent showcase box fully aligned with the horseâ€™s outline and free from visual distortions such as warped edges, double images, or unnatural light refractions?",
    "explanation": "The transparent showcase box in Image B is carefully fitted around the horse sculpture. From the visual inspection, the edges appear crisp without any signs of warping. There are no visible double images or light refraction anomalies that would suggest a lack of alignment or distorted visualization. This indicates that the transparency and integrity of the showcase box design is consistent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the gold accents on the showcase box have uniform color and reflective properties consistent with polished metal, without unnatural highlights or color bleeding?",
    "explanation": "The gold accents on the showcase box in Image B are depicted with a consistent color, suggesting a polished metal surface. The reflections are smooth, and there are no signs of unnatural highlights or color bleeding. The visual properties align with the expectations of metal material, which should have uniform reflective characteristics and a lack of arbitrary color alterations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the brand logo clearly legible, properly centered on the black base stand, and free from pixelation or blurring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brand logo on the black base stand is crisp and clear, suggesting high image resolution as there is no pixelation or blurring present. The logo is also properly centered, maintaining a balanced aesthetic, which indicates that the edit maintains clarity and precision.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the internal backdrop pattern follow the correct perspective of the box and avoid warping, tiling errors, or partial cutoffs at the edges?",
    "explanation": "The internal backdrop pattern in Image B is observed to follow the correct perspective of the box with no visible distortions. The patterns are smoothly integrated without any warping or tiling errors, and there are no partial cutoffs along the edges. This alignment suggests that the design elements were considered carefully in the edit.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the magnetic closure mechanism visibly integrated into the box structure without gaps, overlaps, or floating components that suggest mechanical impossibility?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the showcase box's closure mechanism appears well-integrated with the rest of the structure. There are no visible gaps or overlaps that would imply mechanical flaws, and all components are coherently connected, avoiding a floating appearance that would suggest a lack of physical feasibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all visible parts of the horse sculpture (including the head, legs, saddle, and painted areas) clearly preserved and unobscured by the added packaging elements?",
    "explanation": "The horse sculpture in Image B is placed within a transparent packaging that allows for clear visibility of all its parts. None of the details, including the head, legs, saddle, and painted areas, appear to be obstructed by the showcase box. This clear presentation ensures that the sculpture is entirely visible, maintaining its aesthetic and historical representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
