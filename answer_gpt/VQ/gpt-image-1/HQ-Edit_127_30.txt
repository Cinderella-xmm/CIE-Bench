    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed violin body maintain consistent surface texture and lighting behavior with a high-quality engraved case, without unnatural sheen or texture mismatches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the violin body is transformed into what appears to be a high-quality engraved case. The surface texture and lighting are consistent throughout, with no signs of unnatural sheen or mismatched textures. The engravings appear well-integrated into the body, suggesting careful rendering that mimics the expectations of a high-quality product. The lighting reflects appropriately across the surface, maintaining a realistic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the gold accents on the chinrest and tailpiece seamlessly integrated with no visible seams, unnatural reflections, or color bleeding into adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold accents on what would traditionally be the chinrest and tailpiece are observed. They are seamlessly integrated with the rest of the design, showing no visible seams or unnatural reflections. The lighting is appropriately managed so that the gold appears cohesive with the surrounding materials, and there is no color bleeding. This suggests a well-executed design without digital artifacts that would disrupt the realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the scripted font along the strings clearly legible, aligned with string curvature, and free from distortion or floating effects that suggest digital overlay errors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scripted font runs along the area where the strings are supposed to be. The text appears clearly legible and is aligned with the curvature of the 'string' area, maintaining the perspective consistent with the object. There are no distortion or floating effects that would suggest errors in digital overlay. The text is integrated well into the design, demonstrating effective attention to detail in its rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the newly designed pedestal stand have proportionally correct legs and decorative elements that match the vintage aesthetic without appearing undersized, misaligned, or structurally unstable?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pedestal stand is visible. The legs and decorative elements are proportionately designed, matching the vintage aesthetic aimed for in such an image. They do not appear undersized or misaligned, and the structure looks stable, consistent with the weight and balance expected of such a display piece. The design choice ensures that the stand complements the transformed violin without appearing out of place.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the key structural components of the violin—such as the f-holes, bridge, and scroll—still present in accurate positions and proportions relative to each other, even after modifications?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, essential features like f-holes, bridge, and scroll typical of a traditional violin are replaced with a stylized representation as part of the transformation into an engraved piece. These components are no longer present as the design intent was likely to create an artistic rendition rather than maintaining traditional structure. Hence, they are not present in their traditional form which was the objective of the modification.",
    "answer": "No"
