      "question": "Are the pandas holding the surfboards seamlessly integrated into the scene without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When assessing Image B, the pandas appear well-integrated into the scene, as there are no visible artifacts disrupting the seamlessness of the edited image. The lighting on the pandas matches the sunset environment, contributing to a natural appearance without any texture anomalies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surfboards held by the pandas maintain their original shape and proportions without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfboards held by the pandas show consistency in shape and size compared to typical surfboards. From the top curve to the bottom fins, they maintain a realistic surfboard appearance. A comparison to Image A shows that the surfboards' proportions remain unchanged.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the pandas' postures and positioning appear natural and consistent with the beach and sunset environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pandas in Image B are positioned standing and facing the sunset, holding the surfboards as would be expected of humans in such a setting. The posture aligns with the activity of surfing and the environment, suggesting a deliberate and natural pose consistent with a typical sunset beach scenario. While pandas are not usually found in such a context, they are posed in a manner that's coherent within this scene.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the sunset and beach setting remained intact and visually credible without any alterations or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setting in Image B maintains the visual integrity of the sunset and beach environment as depicted in Image A. There is no noticeable distortion or alteration affecting the credibility of the sunset or the cohesion of the beach scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pandas' sizes relative to the surfboards and the environment proportionally realistic and physically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering Image B, the pandas' sizes are relatively larger than realistic pandas due to the intended anthropomorphic depiction. They stand upright, matching human-like proportions relative to the surfboards, making it physically plausible within the image context. Compared to Image A, where human figures are expected, the pandas mimic similar size relationships to ensure plausibility.",
