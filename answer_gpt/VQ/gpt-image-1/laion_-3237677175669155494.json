      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the mechanical sentinels replacing the buses have intact geometric shapes, smooth surfaces, and consistent glowing blue underlights without visible rendering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical sentinels are depicted as modified buses with geometric shapes and glowing blue underlights suggestive of futuristic technology. The surfaces of these sentinels appear smooth with consistent glowing underlights, lacking noticeable rendering artifacts such as jagged edges or inconsistent lighting, which supports the notion of a seamlessly edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the golden automaton version of Big Ben have uniform metallic texture, proper vertical alignment, and a centrally placed cosmic eye clockface without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden automaton that replaces Big Ben in Image B has a striking metallic texture that appears uniform across its structure. The vertical alignment is preserved, maintaining the iconic silhouette albeit in a new form, with the cosmic eye replacing the traditional clock face. This central feature is perfectly circular, showing no signs of distortion, and fits well within the design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the energetic vines wrapped around the Houses of Parliament following plausible growth patterns, maintaining consistent glow, and not intersecting through solid architectural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the energetic vines are depicted as glowing elements that wrap around the Houses of Parliament. They follow paths that seem plausible though fantastical, consistent in glow and hue. They are carefully designed to avoid intersecting with the solid form of the architectural elements, navigating around rather than through, maintaining the integrity of the structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the airships in the sky properly scaled, positioned at a reasonable altitude, and displaying iridescent surfaces without harsh edges or shadow mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The airships depicted in Image B are scaled to fit contextually within the sky above the scene, maintaining reasonable proportions to avoid overshadowing other aspects of the image. Their positions suggest an altitude high enough to look natural in relation to the other objects. The surfaces are iridescent with smooth transitions, presenting without harsh edges or mismatched shadows.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements (underlights, cosmic eye, vines, airships) blend with the ambient lighting of the scene without creating overly bright spots or unnatural contrast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing elements in Image B, including the underlights, cosmic eye, vines, and airships, are rendered in a manner that integrates well with the scene's overall ambient lighting. Their luminosity complements the night setting, avoiding overly bright or contrasting spots that might disrupt visual harmony. They contribute to a cohesive visual theme without causing disruptions in tone or contrast.",
