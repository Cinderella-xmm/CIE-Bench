    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the stone-like texture applied to the mountain's surface exhibit uniformity and natural variation in roughness, without visible artifacts like repeating patterns or abrupt transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature has a stone-like texture that appears to mimic a natural, rocky surface. The texture shows a mix of smooth areas and fine cracks, which suggests a realistic portrayal of stone with natural variation. No visible artifacts, such as repeating patterns or abrupt transitions, were observed, making the texture appear uniformly crafted without artificial visual disruptions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the rock-carved eyes positioned symmetrically and proportionally on the mountain’s peak, with realistic depth and integration into the terrain, avoiding floating or misplaced features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon-like creature has eyes carved into its face which are symmetrically placed on either side of the head. The eyes appear proportionate to the head, with attention to realistic depth, ensuring they look integrated into the stone form rather than appearing as floating or misplaced elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wing-like ridges extend from the mountain’s sides in a way that follows natural geological lines and does not introduce sharp, broken, or impossible angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features wing-like structures that extend from the sides of the mountainous creature. These wings have a curvature and positioning that align with what would be expected from a large geological or mythical structure. The angles are smooth and consistent, avoiding sharp or unnatural breaks, suggesting a plausible integration with the creature’s form.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the limbs of the creature integrated with the tree silhouettes in a way that avoids visual conflicts such as overlapping branches appearing behind solid limbs or disconnected joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's limbs are placed in such a way that they do not visually conflict with the surrounding tree silhouettes. The limbs are solid and do not have branches overlapping them in jarring or unrealistic ways, indicating careful consideration of spatial relationships to maintain the integrity of the creature’s form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the luminous veins emit a soft glow that blends with the blue and pink hues of the sky, without creating bright halos, sharp edges, or overexposed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminous veins on the creature in Image B emit a subtle and controlled glow. They blend well with the blue and pink tones of the sky, ensuring no overexposed areas or sharp contrasts are present. The glow appears soft, avoiding bright halos or sharp, unrealistic edges, maintaining a harmonious integration with the surrounding environment.",
