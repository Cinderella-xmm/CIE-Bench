    "Question": "Q4: Does the background cityscape feature detailed brass towers and airships arranged in a spatially plausible layout, with consistent lighting and shadowing under a sepia tone, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a cityscape featuring brass towers and airships that are intricately detailed. They are positioned to create a sense of depth and spatial plausibility, with consistent lighting and shadowing that contribute to the sepia aesthetic. Elements are interconnected, with no discernible floating or disjointed parts, maintaining an immersive world-building consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sepia tone applied consistently across the entire image, maintaining visible details in the character’s clothing, mechanical elements, and background without causing fading, discoloration, or loss of contrast in critical areas?",
    "explanation": "The sepia tone is evenly applied throughout Image B, giving it a cohesive vintage appearance. Despite this warm overlay, the details in the character’s attire, mechanical components, and background architecture remain sharp and discernible. There are no significant areas where fading or discoloration obscure essential details, indicating careful control of contrast and color balance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
