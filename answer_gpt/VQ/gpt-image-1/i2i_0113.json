      "question": "Does the character's face maintain its natural appearance and texture while integrated into the soft vinyl material without visible unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's face is intentionally blurred, leaving insufficient detail to make a judgment about its texture. Therefore, an evaluation cannot confirm if the face maintains a natural appearance or if it is integrated into the vinyl material without artifacts due to the provided image condition of blurred view.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the character's body proportions and posture logically consistent and visually credible within the form of a soft vinyl figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted as a soft vinyl figure with chibi-style proportions, which features an exaggerated head-to-body ratio and simplified limb structures. These are common and intentional design choices in vinyl figures rather than flaws, giving the character a visually cute and stylized appearance that is typical for such figures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the character's suit retained its detailed textures and material realism without introduction of unnatural artifacts in the soft vinyl figure design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's suit has translated into a smooth, matte texture coherent with the typical vinyl figure's aesthetic. This involves some loss of realism but does not introduce visual artifacts. The texture change aligns with the material properties of vinyl figures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the interchangeable accessories, such as weapons and hand gestures, integrate seamlessly with the figure's design without disrupting its structural consistency or introducing visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, accessories like weapons and hands are designed to match the overall style of the figure. The seams where parts attach are standard for soft vinyl figures and are practically non-invasive in terms of visual consistency, blending well with the figure's design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character stand naturally on the black base without visible distortion or unnatural support, ensuring the figure's visual stability and plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character stands stably on a black base, designed as part of the figure. The proportions and positioning do not show any distortion or require unnatural support, which is typical for figures ensuring they stand securely and appear visually stable.",
