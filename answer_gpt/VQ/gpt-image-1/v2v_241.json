      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D models of the horse and elephant maintain their current pose without any unnatural distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is standing on top of the elephant, which mirrors the pose found in Image A. Both models in Image B are chibi-style 3D representations characterized by exaggerated features for a cute effect but maintain a coherent and plausible body posture without visible distortion. The limbs of both animals are well-rounded and proportionally fit the chibi style. Thus, based on visual cues, their pose is maintained with stylization but without deformation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the photorealistic background of the grassy field and sky free from any artifacts or distortions introduced by the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a photorealistic background similar to Image A, representing a grassy field under a sky with clouds. The background appears intact and consistent with natural scenery, free of artifacts, distortions, or noticeable editing flaws, and fits well with the chibi models in the foreground without introducing visual discrepancies.",

      "question": "Does the ornate photo frame blend naturally with the scene without causing any visual disruption or introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an ornate frame surrounding the chibi-style models and the photorealistic background. The frame possesses a consistent texture and color that doesn't disrupt the visual harmony of the image. It frames the scene in a complementary manner, suggesting an artistic choice rather than an editorial mishap, maintaining the quality of integration into the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi-style 3D models of the horse and elephant preserved, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style 3D models in Image B retain exaggerated proportions typical of this style, such as larger heads and smaller limbs, while maintaining coherent shapes and consistent scaling. These models display logical continuity in their proportions and no signs of broken geometry or unnatural alterations, sticking to stylized but rational design.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D models retain fine details without any loss or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style 3D models in Image B exhibit smooth textures and clean surfaces appropriate for the style. They maintain fine details like facial features and structured body shapes without any loss or unnatural textures. Their rendering adheres to 3D modeling principles, showing coherence and completeness in detail preservation.",
