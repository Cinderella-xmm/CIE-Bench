    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the table and chairs composed of uniformly sized brown and amber LEGO bricks with clean, interlocking edges and no visible breaks or misalignments in their surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the furniture consists of uniformly sized LEGO bricks, which are known for their precise design and interlocking capability. LEGO bricks typically have clean edges that fit snugly together with no breaks or misalignments, ensuring structural stability. The visual cues show that the furniture maintains a clean appearance, typical of well-assembled LEGO models, and there are no visible gaps or defects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the tabletop and chair seats display a consistent LEGO brick texture with repeating stud patterns and no unnatural stretching or distortion of individual bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop and chair seats exhibit the well-known LEGO brick texture, which features a pattern of smooth surfaces with studs that ensure secure connections between pieces. The consistent size and uniformity of the studs indicate that there is no distortion or stretching. The design is typical of LEGO's precise manufacturing standards, which prevent visual abnormalities like stretching in the bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the central element on the table a LEGO-style plant made of green bricks with recognizable leaf shapes, and is it positioned centrally without overlapping or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table features a central element that resembles a plant made from green LEGO bricks. The structure includes recognizable simple leaf shapes crafted from small LEGO pieces. The central positioning of this element indicates good placement as it does not overlap with other objects and rests firmly on the table surface, which is typical for a securely placed LEGO model.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the furniture placed on a flat, gray LEGO baseplate that fits snugly beneath the table and chairs, with no overhang beyond the furniture edges and no visible seam between the baseplate and the real ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO furniture placed on a flat, gray baseplate. The baseplate is sized to fit the furniture arrangement without extending beyond its edges. There is no visible seam between the baseplate and any real ground, as the integration is complete and seamless, indicating that the entire composition is intended to be LEGO-based rather than mixed with real elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged edges, pixelation, or unnatural lighting shadows around the LEGO furniture that suggest incomplete rendering or poor integration with the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO furniture is displayed without visible artifacts like jagged edges or pixelation. The lighting appears consistent with the style typically found in high-quality LEGO renders, leading to the conclusion that there is no evidence of incomplete rendering or integration issues. The smooth finish and uniform lighting across the scene underscore the clarity and coherence of the image rendering.",
