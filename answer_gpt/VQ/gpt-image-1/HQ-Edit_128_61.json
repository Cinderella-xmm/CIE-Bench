      "question": "Does the transformed tagine retain its original conical shape and base proportions, with no visible warping or deformation in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B is not a tagine but a lamp, commonly associated with Aladdin's magic lamp. Therefore, it does not have the conical shape and base proportions of a tagine at all. A tagine typically has a distinct conical lid and a wide, shallow base, while this lamp features an elongated body and a spout, characteristic of traditional oil lamps. Thus, the original tagine shape is not present in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arabesque patterns and gem-like details on the tagine's surface evenly rendered with consistent texture, lighting response, and material properties, without any visible seams or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp is adorned with arabesque patterns and gem-like details. These decorations appear evenly rendered with a consistent texture that reflects light appropriately. The jewels have realistic glints, and the ornate surface does not show visible seams or unnatural highlights. This suggests a high level of craftsmanship in the rendering of the object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the smoke emerging from the tagine smooth, translucent, and flowing naturally, with a clearly defined but soft-edged genie silhouette that does not exhibit jagged lines or digital distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smoke in Image B emerges from the tip of the lamp and forms a slowly dissipating, smooth, translucent plume. Embedded within the smoke is the impression of a genie, which is outlined in a soft, undistorted manner. There are no jagged lines or apparent digital distortions, presenting a seamless and naturally flowing image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the metallic threads and jewel-like elements on the fabric appear embedded within the textile weave, with realistic reflection and shadowing that matches the surrounding material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fabric beneath the lamp in Image B is richly adorned with metallic threads and jewel-like elements, which appear to be integrated into the textile. The reflective properties of the metallic elements and the jewels correspond well with the textile's weave, displaying realistic shadowing and reflections that align with the light source in the scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the tagine and the smoke consistent with the light source direction, and do they properly interact with the fabric and surrounding environment without floating or misplaced areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp casts shadows that seem to conform to the direction of the implied light source indicated by the overall lighting. The shadows fall onto the fabric realistically, complementing the flow of the smoke. There are no indications of the shadows being misplaced or floating inconsistently relative to the rest of the environment.",
