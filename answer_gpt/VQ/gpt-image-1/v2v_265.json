      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi-style cartoon locomotive is depicted with exaggerated features typical of cartoon characters, yet it maintains the fundamental structural elements of the original train from Image A. The locomotive has a consistent shape with no signs of broken or distorted geometry. This coherency is necessary for retaining recognizable features of trains, serving both aesthetic and functional purposes even in a stylized form.",
