      "question": "Does the metallic texture of the badge appear natural without introducing any unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a metallic keychain with a circular design that resembles a wristwatch. The metallic texture is expected to be reflective and smooth, characteristic of metals like stainless steel. In the image, the texture appears smooth and consistent, without any visual artifacts or pixelation disrupting the surface. This suggests a high-resolution and well-edited image where the texture looks realistic. Therefore, the metallic texture appears natural.",

      "question": "Is the circular frame of the clock/badge perfectly round, without any visible geometric distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular frame of the clock/badge should be symmetrical and perfectly round, typical of precision-made objects like watches or badges. The visual inspection highlights a consistent curvature without noticeable irregularities that would indicate deformation or distortion in the editing process. Consequently, the circle maintains a perfect roundness.",

      "question": "Do the hour, minute, and second hands retain their original proportions and alignment, avoiding any distortion or misplacement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock hands on the badge in Image B are traditionally expected to have a fixed alignment and proportion relative to each other, with the hour hand being the shortest and thickest, followed by the minute hand, and the second hand being the thinnest and longest. In this image, all hands appear correctly proportioned and maintain their alignment at the center of the clock face. There is no visible distortion or misplacement detected.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any inconsistent shadows or reflections on the metallic badge that contradict its physical placement as a keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A well-edited metallic badge should have consistent shadows and reflections that match its surroundings and the intended light source. The shadows and reflections on Image B's badge align sensibly with light falling on it, considering its orientation and the surface it rests upon. This suggests that the shadows are consistent with the physics of light interaction with such objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the border thickness and surface finish of the metallic badge consistent and detailed enough to maintain the image's overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The border of the metallic badge in Image B should have a uniform thickness and a smooth finish, reflecting light accurately. Observing the image, the border appears consistently thick around the entirety of the badge, and the surface finish is smooth and polished. This contributes to the image's authenticity and a realistic representation of a metallic object.",
