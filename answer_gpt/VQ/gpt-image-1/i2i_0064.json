      "question": "Are the cat's limbs and body proportions appropriate for its new lounging pose on the sofa without appearing unnaturally distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat is presented as lounging comfortably on a sofa, with its body and limbs proportionate to its posture. The visual information shows legs and paws relaxed and resting naturally on the sofa, aligning with how a real cat would position itself. This alignment and posture do not suggest any anatomical distortion, indicating that the proportions are appropriate.",

      "explanation": "The glasses appear to be well-aligned with the cat's eyes, positioned where eyeglasses would naturally sit if worn by a cat.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
