    "Question": "Q1: Are the black and blue brick textures on the motorcycle body panels uniformly aligned and geometrically consistent with the original angular design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is constructed using LEGO bricks which often feature predefined shapes, making achieving certain angles or curves challenging. The black and blue bricks are arranged in a manner consistent with the angular design typical of LEGO creations, giving a blocky and geometric appearance. The consistency of alignment is maintained due to the inherent structure of LEGO bricks, which snap into place. However, achieving the precise angular consistency seen in traditional graphic designs like in Image A is generally challenging with LEGO, possibly leading to a less uniform appearance. Despite this, given the context and limitations of LEGO as a medium, the alignment appears consistent and in line with the design seen in the original image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the cog-patterned rims maintain circular shape and evenly spaced teeth that match the wheel diameter and do not appear stretched or broken?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rims are made of circular LEGO elements designed to resemble gear-like cogs, which are built to naturally maintain a circular shape. The 'teeth' or details on the rims appear evenly spaced and conform to the structural constraints of LEGO design. There is no evidence of stretching or breakage in the circular shape or in the spacing of the details. The geometric integrity of the rim is preserved through the structure of the LEGO design, which supports even spacing and circular integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the colorful decals seamlessly embedded into the brick surface, showing no visible gaps, overlaps, or unnatural layering effects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the decals are presented as stickers applied to the surface of the LEGO motorcycle. With the inherent precision of LEGO, decals are usually designed to fit well without overlaps or gaps when applied correctly. In this case, decals seem to adhere flatly to the bricks, appearing appropriately aligned with no visible gaps or overlaps that are apparent from a visual inspection. The decals appear naturally integrated as part of the overall design, maintaining an intended seamless appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the gray baseplate flat, continuous, and properly supporting the motorcycle’s wheels without any visible elevation mismatch or distortion?",
    "explanation": "The baseplate in Image B appears to be composed of LEGO plates, known for their flat and stable design, offering a solid and level support for constructions placed on them. The surface shows consistent continuity without any visible distortion or unevenness, effectively supporting the motorcycle’s structure. There is no visible elevation mismatch, ensuring that the motorcycle is evenly supported by the baseplate.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the display case have clear, undistorted boundaries with no ghosting, refraction errors, or unintended shadows affecting the motorcycle's appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the display case is a clear enclosure, typical for showcasing objects while protecting them from dust and harm. The glass or transparent material of the case appears to have clear boundaries with no visible areas of ghosting or distortion that would typically result from material flaws. There is no evidence of optical refraction errors that would distort the appearance of the motorcycle. The boundaries of the case are clear, and no unintended shadows are casting on the motorcycle that would alter its visual fidelity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
