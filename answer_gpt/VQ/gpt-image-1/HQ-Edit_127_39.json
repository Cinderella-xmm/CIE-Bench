      "question": "Is the energy crown at the top of the Eiffel Tower symmetrically aligned with the tower’s central axis and does it cast consistent light without visible rendering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a futuristic reinterpretation of the Eiffel Tower with an energy crown at the top. The energy crown is visually centered, aligning with the tower’s central axis. The lighting from the energy crown appears consistent, without noticeable rendering artifacts like irregularities or glitches. This assessment is based on the alignment and uniformity of the illumination, which are typical indicators of proper rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the iron lattice girders of the Eiffel Tower preserved in their original geometric configuration, with no signs of bending, stretching, or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the Eiffel Tower has been artistically transformed, the iron lattice girders appear to retain their original geometric structure. There are no visible signs of bending, stretching, or disconnected segments, indicating that the structural integrity has been preserved amidst the artistic modifications.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the luminescent circuits run continuously along the tower’s surface without floating above it, and do they emit light that blends naturally with the surrounding illumination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminescent circuits in Image B are integrated along the surface of the tower without appearing to float. They emit a light that blends with the ambient lighting, enhancing the overall futuristic appearance while maintaining visual coherence. The placement and interaction of light suggest a well-executed design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the digital glyphs embedded into the girders without causing visible displacement or deformation of the metal structure beneath them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, digital glyphs appear to be embedded within the structure of the Eiffel Tower without deforming or displacing the metal girders beneath. This indicates that the embedding process was done carefully to preserve the integrity of the structure while adding digital details.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the holographic elements appear translucent and layered with depth, and do they avoid intersecting solid parts of the tower or showing pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic elements in Image B are rendered with a sense of translucency and depth, avoiding intersection with solid parts of the Eiffel Tower. They are clear and well-defined without visible pixelation, suggesting high-quality layering and rendering techniques were used.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the pixelated energy barriers positioned directly around the base of the tower and do they have sharp, consistent edges without blurring or floating above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pixelated energy barriers depicted in Image B are positioned around the base of the tower. They have sharp, consistent edges, and they do not appear to blur or float above the ground. This suggests careful placement and attention to maintaining the illusion of physical presence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the digital eyes located in a position consistent with the tower’s architecture and do they emit light that casts soft shadows and reflects off adjacent surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital eyes are integrated into positions that are architecturally consistent with the tower’s design. They emit light that interacts naturally with the surroundings by casting soft shadows and creating reflections on adjacent surfaces. This integration reflects a sophisticated understanding of light behavior and environmental interaction.",
