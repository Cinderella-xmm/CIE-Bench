      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the dog's fur consistent and natural across both the left side and back views in the combined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's fur is illustrated with a consistent cartoon-like style that retains the same color and simplicity across both the side view and back view. The fur texture does not aim for naturalism but for stylistic coherence within the illustrated medium. Given the uniformity in color and design, the fur looks consistent across different views.",

      "question": "Does the dog maintain appropriate proportions between its front and back views without noticeable distortion or deformation in the combined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's proportions appear consistent when comparing its side and back views. The head, body, and tail sizes are harmonious and don't reveal any distortion when viewed together on the bed. The depiction adheres to the cartoon style, keeping the character proportionately realistic within this framework.",

      "question": "Does the dog appear naturally positioned on the bed in both the left side and back views within the combined image, maintaining visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the dog lying on the bed in positions that match the represented perspectives — side and back. It seems that the dog's body angles and positioning are believable for a cartoon dog lounging on a bed. The bed accommodates the dog’s posture naturally, supporting the visual cohesion.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog's ears and tail in Image B are consistent with a cartoon style, defined clearly in the illustration with solid colors and simple textures. They do not display unnatural artifacts; the simplicity is intentional and fits with the overall illustration style without missing elements or irregular outlines.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
