    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal facets on the truck's cabin and body uniformly shaped and aligned with the original panel lines, without visible breaks or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "Based on visual cues from Image B, the crystal facets on the truck's cabin and body are well-aligned and follow the original panel lines. The craftsmanship in the crystal fabrication is precise, and there are no noticeable breaks or misalignment of the facets. By using world knowledge of how objects are typically carved or molded to retain realistic details, it is reasonable to conclude the facets are uniform and aligned.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the transparent quartz wheels maintain the same size, spacing, and axle alignment as the original muddy wheels, with no floating or misplaced components?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the quartz wheels appear to match the scale and positioning seen in Image A. The spacing and alignment are consistent, and the wheels do not seem to float or shift unreasonably from the original layout. Analyzing this with the expectation that the crafted model would aim to retain accurate proportions to depict the original faithfully, these elements seem properly implemented.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the quartz wheels internally detailed with natural-looking crystal lattice structures that follow the shape of the original hubs and rims, without jagged or inconsistent lines?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows quartz wheels with clear lattice structures inside that replicate the hubs and rims seen in Image A. These details are sharply defined and follow the original pattern without jagged edges. By understanding the precision often required in sculptural art, it is expected that these features would be depicted accurately and smoothly, indicating attention to detail in craftsmanship.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the white marble platform flat, continuous, and properly supporting the entire underside of the crystal truck, with no visible gaps or floating sections?",
    "explanation": "Using visual cues from Image B, the marble platform appears flat and seamless, with the crystal truck fully supported by it. There are no visible gaps or sections where the truck appears to be unsteady or unsupported, indicating that the base construction is done carefully to ensure stability equivalent to a display model.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the crystal surfaces display subtle color refraction and reflections consistent with emerald and jade materials, without unnatural glowing patches or excessive chromatic aberration?",
    "explanation": "Visual analysis of Image B shows the crystal surfaces exhibit subtle refraction and reflections typical of emerald or jade, with the choice of a deep green color enhancing these effects. There are no signs of artificial glowing or intense chromatic aberrations, which supports the realism and likeness to natural materials. Hence, these visual qualities align with expectations of a skillfully created crystal model.",
    "answer": "Yes"
