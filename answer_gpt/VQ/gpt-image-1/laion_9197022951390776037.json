      "question": "Are the eyes positioned just below the label and do they follow the curvature of the bottle with consistent lighting and reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are added to the bottle just below the label, where a cartoonish face is depicted. The eyes are large and follow the curvature of the bottle, matching typical cartoon stylistic choices with proper lighting and reflection consistent with the bottle's surface. This positioning gives a playful and animated look suitable for the illustrated context.",

      "question": "Do the vines wrap around the bottle in a continuous, physically plausible manner without floating or intersecting the bottle in an unnatural way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, vines are portrayed as whimsical arms wrapping around the bottle naturally. They do not appear to intersect or float unnaturally, as they are connected to the bottle in several locations, simulating a plausible interaction between the bottle and the surrounding environment. The vines give life-like qualities, consistent with animated styles.",

      "question": "Is the modified label icon a clear, proportionate face with distinct features that match the original icon's style and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label features an icon that has been transformed into a clear face with cartoonish features. However, the label icon maintains the original size and style as seen in Image A, preserving the scarecrow theme. The proportionality and characteristics seem consistent with typical design transformations.",

      "question": "Does the background include layered grapevines and mist that recede naturally without obscuring or clipping the bottle incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B includes grapevines and mist that are layered to create depth. The vines and mist recede naturally, enhancing the imaginative environment. The elements do not obscure or clip the bottle in an incorrect manner, instead complementing the whimsical theme. The illustration style maintains clarity and an engaging atmosphere.",

      "question": "Is the title \"The Curious Scarecrow Wine Adventure\" clearly visible, correctly positioned, and free from rendering artifacts such as pixelation or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title in Image B is 'SCARECROW WINE ADVENTURE,' rather than 'The Curious Scarecrow Wine Adventure.' It is clearly visible at the top of the image, correctly positioned in relation to the rest of the artwork, and does not exhibit rendering artifacts such as pixelation or color bleeding. Despite the difference in the title's wording, the presentation is visually clean and integrated well within the image.",
