      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossom petals in the air and on the ground evenly distributed with clear, non-overlapping edges and consistent size variation typical of stylized woodblock art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In a stylized woodblock print, elements like cherry blossom petals are often evenly distributed with purposeful size variation to add artistic flair. In Image B, the petals show these characteristics; they appear scattered yet organized, maintaining clear, non-overlapping edges which is indicative of traditional woodblock designs.",

      "question": "Is the matte texture applied uniformly across the entire image without obscuring facial features, fabric patterns, or the basketâ€™s weave structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The matte texture applied to Image B is uniform and consistent with the artistic style of a woodblock print. It maintains clarity in fabric patterns and basket weave structures, enhancing rather than obscuring these elements. This approach aligns with the method of highlighting textures seen in traditional and stylized woodblock printing.",

      "question": "Does the basket preserve its cylindrical shape and handle structure with visible, coherent weaving lines, even if simplified?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The basket in Image B retains a cylindrical shape that is typical in stylized art forms. Its handle structure appears intact and the weaving lines, although simplified, are coherent and perceptible. This simplification yet preservation of details is a common feature of woodblock prints, where complex structures are depicted with artful simplification.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands display five fingers each, with a natural joint alignment and no signs of extra digits or unnatural curvature. Although stylized, the representation maintains human anatomical correctness, a common practice ensuring figures in woodblock prints are both expressive and accurately depicted.",
