    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior maintain accurate limb proportions and body structure without distorted joints or exaggerated features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Aquatic warrior's model has balanced limb proportions, and the body structure appears natural. The joints are not distorted, and there are no exaggerated features. The overall representation aligns with standard human anatomy principles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the metallic blue surfaces of the armor rendered with natural light reflections and depth, avoiding flat or uniform coloring?",
    "explanation": "The metallic blue surfaces in Image B display variations in shading and reflections, which create a sense of depth and natural lighting on the armor. This indicates that the rendering is done with consideration to light and surface textures, thus avoiding a flat appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the trident positioned correctly in the hand and scaled appropriately relative to the figure, without bending or truncation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trident is well-positioned in the warriorâ€™s hand. It maintains an appropriate scale relative to the figure and does not display any signs of bending or truncation. This suggests a thoughtful design and attention to proportion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the dome enclosing the model have smooth curvature and consistent transparency without visible stitching, warping, or reflection anomalies?",
    "explanation": "The dome surrounding the model in Image B shows a smooth curvature and maintains consistent transparency. There are no signs of stitching, warping, or reflection anomalies, indicating quality craftsmanship and rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the coral reef base textured with natural-looking organic patterns and scaled appropriately to support the model without appearing undersized or oversized?",
    "explanation": "The coral reef base in Image B is textured with natural-looking patterns and appears to be scaled appropriately to support the model of the Aquatic warrior. It does not appear undersized or oversized, providing a balanced base for the display.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the swirling ocean currents around the model follow continuous, directional flow paths without abrupt breaks or floating fragments?",
    "explanation": "The swirling ocean currents in Image B exhibit smooth and continuous flow paths. There are no abrupt breaks or floating fragments, suggesting careful attention to design continuity and fluid dynamics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the hand holding the trident have exactly five fingers with natural joint angles and grip pressure, without extra digits or unnatural bends?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hand gripping the trident has exactly five fingers. The joint angles and grip appear natural and without unnatural bends or additional digits, contributing to the life-like representation of the hand.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are all elements (model, dome, base, currents) spatially aligned and layered correctly, with no floating or disconnected parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, all elements including the model, dome, base, and currents are spatially aligned and layered correctly. There are no floating or disconnected parts, indicating a coherent and integrated design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
