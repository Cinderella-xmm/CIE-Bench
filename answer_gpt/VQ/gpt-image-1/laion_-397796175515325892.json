      "question": "Are the edges of the church’s spire and rooflines smooth and continuous without jagged breaks or warped segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church’s spire and rooflines are depicted in an illustrative style, characterized by clean, smooth lines typical of digital illustration. The edges of the spire and rooflines appear smooth and continuous, following the design style of an architectural illustration. Comparing this with Image A is not directly relevant since Image A is a photograph and possesses natural irregularities that are not present in stylized depictions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the left and right halves of the church’s façade mirror each other exactly, causing any misalignment in window positions or wall contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church’s façade is highly symmetrical, with both halves mirroring each other perfectly, characteristic of stylized architectural representations. Such artistic depictions often emphasize symmetry and balance, leading to precise mirroring in features like windows and wall contours. In Image A, which is a photograph, there might be slight asymmetries due to the perspective and real-world imperfections. However, Image B as an illustration likely aimed for perfect symmetry as part of its design.",

      "question": "Does the metallic gold accent on the spire have a uniform, reflective appearance without clashing textures or unnatural glow spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a consistent color palette, where the gold accents appear uniform without clashing textures or unnatural glow spots. The illustration style provides a flat, even depiction of metallic surfaces, reflecting a uniform appearance. Inserting reflective or glow aspects would have disrupted the stylistic integrity of the illustration, which was not attempted in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the height of the spire proportionally balanced with the width and height of the church’s main body, avoiding extreme vertical stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artistic depiction in Image B maintains proportions that are typical for stylized architectural illustrations, where the height of the spire complements the width and height of the church's main body. Knowledge of architectural styles suggests that some exaggeration might be part of the art form; however, in this illustration, the proportions appear balanced and harmonious, fitting the context of a balanced, structured aesthetic.",

      "question": "Does the celestial background blend seamlessly with the top edge of the church and surrounding sky, without abrupt color shifts or floating objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the celestial background seems intentionally designed to match seamlessly with the top edge of the church spire. The consistent starry night enhances the illustration's aesthetic, blending the church into the scene without creating abrupt color shifts or floating objects. This suggests a careful design emphasis and work to ensure the cohesive integration of elements.",

    {

      "question": "Are the window frames, arch designs, and roof tile patterns still visible and clearly defined in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although details are simplified due to the illustrative style, the key architectural elements like window frames, arch designs, and roof tile patterns are depicted clearly and distinctly. The artist presumably stylized these elements to maintain visual recognition while fitting within the overall art style, suggesting a clear definition in the context of illustration.",

      "question": "Is the artwork fully contained within the matte black frame, with no visible clipping or stretching at the borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frames encapsulate the artwork completely, with the matte black frames providing a finished boundary to the illustration. There's no indication of clipping or stretching, indicating careful design and rendering to fit the image neatly into its frame, consistent with presentation in a triptych format.",
