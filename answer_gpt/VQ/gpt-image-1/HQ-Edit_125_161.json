      "question": "Does the lattice-like scale pattern along the serpent's body follow the spiral curve smoothly without abrupt breaks or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent’s body has a lattice-like scale pattern that needs to follow the spiral curve smoothly. Observing the shape and smoothness of the pattern, it seems to integrate seamlessly with the spiral form of the staircase. There are no visible breaks or misaligned edges disrupting the flow of the pattern along the curve.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the individual segments of the serpent's body aligned with the original stair treads such that each segment corresponds to a step in size and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's body coils along the staircase, potentially aligning with the treads. However, upon examining the alignment, it is evident that the smoothness of the coils does not perfectly match individual steps in terms of size and spacing, as the continuous flow of the serpent's structure overrides specific tread alignment.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the translucent fins extend from the original railing position in a continuous, flowing manner without gaps or distortions in their shape or placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows that the serpent's fins are positioned starting at the base and curve upward, replacing where the railing once was. The fins appear to extend in a continuous flow without visible gaps or distortions that would otherwise disrupt their placement along the former railing's curve.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the marble-like texture on the serpent’s body evenly distributed and consistent with the lighting and shading of the original staircase surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the marble-like texture on the serpent’s body is carefully observed against the original lighting and shading backdrop of the staircase surface. The texture appears consistently applied, and the shading seems harmonious with the staircase atmosphere, indicating an even distribution that matches the lighting conditions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the serpent’s head positioned within the circular opening at the top of the staircase without overlapping or deforming the surrounding wall or ceiling structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals the placement of the serpent’s head at the top of the staircase. It is positioned within the circular opening, fitting without notable overlap or deformation of the walls or ceiling structure surrounding it. The head integration is precise and maintains the integrity of the architectural elements.",
