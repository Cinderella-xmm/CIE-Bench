      "question": "Does the brushstroke effect cover the figure evenly without disrupting the outline of limbs, head, or torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image appears to have a brushstroke effect that is used to stylize the depiction of the gymnast. The effect is applied evenly across the figure, maintaining the contours and outlines of the limbs, head, and torso. The details of the body's shape are still discernible and not lost to the abstract style, which indicates that while the brushstroke technique is evident, it does not obscure the anatomical outlines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the enlarged hands anatomically accurate with five fingers each, and do they maintain natural joint alignment and skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the stylized rendering of the gymnast, the depiction of the hands does not follow the traditional realism of anatomy. The hands are abstract and simplified, lacking the detailed structure such as natural joint alignment or realistic depiction of skin texture. The focus appears to be on artistic representation rather than anatomical accuracy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the elongated legs form a continuous, curved line from the hips to the feet without abrupt bends or discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the legs are artistically elongated in a flowing motion which from hips to feet creates a smooth and continuous line. This maintains the artistic integrity and movement, avoiding any abrupt angles or breaks, allowing the depiction to resemble the gracefulness of a gymnast's pose.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the blue and silver gradients smoothly blended across the leotard and skin, without visible banding or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gradients in this artistic imagery create a seamless transition between colors, emphasizing the artistic flow of motion. The blending of blue and silver is smooth, and there are no apparent signs of banding or unnatural highlight which might otherwise detract from the motion effect intended by the artist.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the swirling ribbons and stars placed around the figure in a manner that follows the direction of movement and does not intersect with the body or balance beam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the image, the addition of swirling ribbons and stars enhances the sense of motion around the gymnast. They are strategically placed to complement the body's lines and are arrayed circularly around the gymnast, not intersecting with the limbs or the balance beam. This positioning enhances the dynamic effect and maintains the figure's visibility.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the matt-finish panel with rounded corners fully visible around the image, without cutting off any part of the gymnast or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is contained within a panel displaying rounded corners, providing a frame-like effect. The interior elements, including the gymnast and the background, are intact and fully encapsulated within this boundary, avoiding any cuts or occlusions that might otherwise impair the visual presentation of the figure or accompanying elements.",
