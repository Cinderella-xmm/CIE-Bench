      "question": "Do the armor elements on the central figure's torso and arms follow natural human body contours without causing distorted shapes or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure's armor appears to be designed to follow the contours of the human body. The armor elements, such as the plating and decorative design, are shaped in a way that complements the natural curves of the torso and arms without any visible distortion or broken geometry. This reflects a typical style seen in armored artwork where realism in body armor is maintained.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ocean-themed armor textures on the rightmost figure's jacket in Image B appear to be designed with intricate detailing that flows naturally across the surface. The overall design does not show signs of tiling or unnatural blending, indicating that the artist took care to ensure smooth and continuous texture application, which is common in professional graphic designs.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand of the rightmost figure is depicted with five fingers. The spacing between the fingers and the joint curvature looks natural, even with the armor applied. This suggests a careful adaptation of armor elements to fit the anatomical structure, a design principle that ensures both aesthetic appeal and anatomical correctness.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean creature motifs on the leftmost figure's armor are detailed and integrated thoughtfully into the design. They are small enough to be considered decorative elements, positioned in a manner that enhances rather than distorts the armor's form, maintaining its structural integrity and decorative appeal.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows of the figures are projected forward onto the rocks, aligning correctly with the sun’s position behind them.
