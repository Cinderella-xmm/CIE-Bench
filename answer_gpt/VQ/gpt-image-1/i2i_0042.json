      "question": "Are the person's arms and hands in a raised position that looks natural and consistent with their chibi-style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person's arms and hands are depicted in an animated chibi-style, where exaggerated gestures are common and contribute to the character's expressiveness. The arms are shown in a raised and welcoming position, which fits well within this illustrative style. Chibi designs often stylize human characteristics in a playful manner, so the pose appears intentional and natural within this context.",

      "question": "Does the added text \"Level 6 · Mega Meal\" blend well with the background and does not introduce distracting artifacts or look unnaturally placed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Level 6 · Mega Meal' in Image B is integrated into the top part of the character sheet format, appearing well-situated and balanced. The font choice and color complement the design and are typical of promotional or themed products, avoiding any distracting artifacts or unnatural placement.",

      "question": "Do the burgers and fries on the table retain their realistic texture, detail, and shape, appearing as if they were untouched by the transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the burgers and fries are no longer depicted realistically; instead, they are transformed into animated, simplified versions typical of chibi illustrations. This transformation involves a loss of realistic texture and detail, where the food items are stylized to complement the chibi character sheet's aesthetic, making them consistent with the overall cartoonish style.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the person been transformed into a chibi-style figure that maintains recognizable facial and body features without unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the person as a chibi-style figure which is generally simpler and more exaggerated in form. While this style retains enough recognizable features to convey the intended resemblance, it naturally involves a loss of detail and a shift to cartoon-like textures, which is consistent within the context of a chibi transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall scene remain visually plausible, with the person now as a chibi-style collectible presented in a trendy acrylic standee character sheet format without any distorted elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is aligned with the concept of a chibi-style acrylic standee. The character design and food items are transformed into a cohesive, cartoonish style that fits the presentation format. The standee structure is visually plausible, without distorted elements, supporting the idea of it being a decorative collectible.",
