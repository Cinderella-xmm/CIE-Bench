      "question": "Does the creature maintain the dog's original body proportions and structure without any unnatural distortions or deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a fantasy creature derived from a dog, characterized by comic-style aesthetics. The body proportions and structure are altered by adding fantastical elements such as bat-like wings and a stylized tail. These elements deviate from the natural anatomy of a dog, causing intentional distortion to fit a fantasy theme, thus not maintaining the original proportions observed in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the texture and fine details of the dog's fur accurately represented in the fantasy creature without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a cartoonish representation of a dog-like creature, emphasizing bold contours and flat colors typical of cartoon art, rather than detailed fur texture as seen in Image A. This stylization uses smooth surfaces without highlighting individual fur strands, which is characteristic of the cartoon style rather than a depiction with realistic details.",

      "question": "Does the custom orb or capsule near the creature's feet appear naturally integrated into the scene without disrupting the visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orb in Image B is stylistically consistent with the overall fantasy and cartoon theme, seamlessly blending with the creature's design. Its colors and style do not clash with the surrounding elements but rather complement the cartoonish appearance. Thus, it integrates naturally into the scene.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the creature's posture and stance remain consistent with the dog's original posture, ensuring structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is depicted standing and facing slightly sideways, contrasting with the laying position of the actual dog in Image A. This posture transformation breaks coherence with the original stance, as the fantasy depiction requires a more dynamic and upright stance suitable for its role as a mythical character.",

    {

      "question": "Is the creature's name and elemental type text clearly legible and does not introduce any visual clutter or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Barkrowl' and 'EARTH' in Image B is clearly legible due to its simple font style and strategic placement, avoiding overlap with busy or complex aspects of the image. The text integrates well without disrupting the visual balance of the composition.",
