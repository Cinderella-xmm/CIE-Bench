        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop setting includes a coffee cup, a glass of water, and a small glass with sugar.

      "question": "Are the shapes and proportions of sea waves and sunlight reflections accurately depicted, maintaining structural consistency without unnatural breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the sea waves and the sunlight reflections on the water. The waves appear naturally formed and the sunlight reflections show the typical sparkling effect one would expect when sunlight hits the surface of the water. There are no noticeable distortions or unnatural breaks in the continuity of the waves and reflections, which indicates accurate depiction.",

      "question": "Do the materials of the seaside elements, such as the table, sea waves, and sunlight reflections, appear authentic, free from unnatural textures and visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the materials depicted—such as the wooden texture of the table, the natural appearance of the sea waves, and the light reflections—appear authentic. The textures are consistent with real-world expectations: the wood grain on the table is visible and the sunlight reflections on the water maintain a realistic shimmer, all of which lack any visual artifacts.",

      "question": "Are the sunlight reflections on the sea waves consistent with the sun's expected position, maintaining physical logic and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunlight reflections in Image B follow a realistic pattern where the light appears to be coming from off-camera to the upper left, reflecting on the sea surface. This placement is consistent with how sunlight typically behaves, reinforcing the physical logic and visual credibility within the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition of the café setting—with the table, chairs, drinks, and background sea—creates a coherent and pleasing visual arrangement. This setting enhances the ambiance of a seaside café without introducing additional elements that would distract from the main subject matter or appear out of place. The arrangement is well balanced and blends naturally.",
