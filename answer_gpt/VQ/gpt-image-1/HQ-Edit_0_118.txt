    "Question": "Q4: Are the leaf outlines within the book pages clearly defined, proportionally scaled to the page size, and integrated without distorting the book's spine, edges, or page curvature?",
    "explanation": "The leaf outlines in the book pages in Image B are well-defined, proportionally scaled to complement the page size. They integrate fluidly, without distorting the book’s structural elements like the spine or curvature, fitting harmoniously into the overall watercolor style, which traditionally supports clean, scaled details.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the added sun rays originate from a logical direction relative to the tree canopy and cast soft glows and subtle shadows that match the depth and density of the surrounding foliage?",
    "explanation": "Image B has sun rays that originate logically from the light source suggested by the tree canopy above, creating soft glows and shadows resonant with the depth of surrounding foliage. Watercolors commonly portray light effects and shadows in a nuanced manner, enhancing realism and dimensionality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
