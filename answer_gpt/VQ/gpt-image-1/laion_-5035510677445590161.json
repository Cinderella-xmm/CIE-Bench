      "question": "Does the explorer coat have a consistent fabric texture with visible stitching and leather accents that appear physically plausible and free of obvious digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an explorer coat made of materials mimicking fabric texture. The coat exhibits visible stitching and leather accents, contributing to its authenticity. These details are consistent across the coat, with smooth transitions and no noticeable digital artifacts, reflecting a realistic representation. The stitching appears well-defined and follows typical patterns, supporting the idea that the garment's design is coherent and plausible for the setting.",

      "question": "Is the tricorn hat properly shaped with three distinct points, correctly sized for the head, and casting a natural shadow consistent with the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tricorn hat in Image B has an identifiable three-point design typical of such hats. Its size and fit appear appropriate for the head, ensuring a realistic integration with the figure. It casts shadows that align with the lighting direction, indicating a plausible interaction with the light source without contradictory shadow patterns, suggesting the hat is consistent with the lighting setting of the scene.",

      "question": "Does the leather gauntlet on the extended hand show five fingers with natural joint bends, and does it connect seamlessly to the sleeve without visible seams or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leather gauntlet depicts five fingers with appropriate joint bends. These features are modeled to suggest natural hand movements, which align realistically with such gloves. The gauntlet connects well with the sleeve, free from distortions or abrupt seams, contributing to the overall coherence of the clothing and its integration with the arm.",

      "question": "Is the snowy mountain background seamlessly blended with the figure, showing consistent lighting, depth cues, and no visible cutout lines or color mismatches along the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowy mountain backdrop in Image B integrates smoothly with the foreground figure. Lighting is coherent across the scene, with the direction and intensity matching both the mountains and the figure. There are no visible cutout lines or color mismatches, facilitating a seamless union of background and subject, ensuring the depth cues are consistent without disrupting the visual coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features, including the beard, glasses, and skin tone, preserved without distortion, and do they receive lighting consistent with the direction and quality of light in the snowy mountain scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B, such as the beard and skin tone, are modeled carefully with natural textures and shapes consistent with real-world expectations. These features receive lighting that aligns with the snowy mountain scene, indicating a uniform light source impacting both the figure and the background. There is no apparent distortion in facial features, contributing to the image's authenticity and realistic appearance.",
