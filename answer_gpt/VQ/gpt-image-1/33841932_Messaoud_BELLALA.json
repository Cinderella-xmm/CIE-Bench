      "question": "Does the bookmark version of the central golden curved skyscraper maintain a smooth, continuous curve without broken or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookmark representing the central golden curved skyscraper shows a smooth, continuous curve in its design. The use of consistent and flowing lines in the illustration suggests that the intended approach was to replicate the building's sleek curvature seen in skyscrapers. Based on common knowledge, smoothness in curved architectural designs often symbolizes elegance and polished craftsmanship. Therefore, the absence of jagged or broken edges indicates an intention to portray this smoothness faithfully.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sharp angles and vertical lines of the angular black skyscraper bookmark clearly defined and geometrically consistent without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookmark mimicking the angular black skyscraper retains well-defined geometric shapes with sharp angles and vertical lines. The clarity and precision of these designs are consistent with common illustrations where architectural lines are rendered crisply to reflect the building's solidity and structured form. There is no visible distortion, which affirms the geometrical accuracy intended to reflect the real building's design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the horizontal steps of the stepped golden building bookmark remain distinct and evenly spaced without merging or overlapping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the bookmark representation, the horizontal steps of the stepped golden building are depicted with distinct separation and evenly spaced intervals. The design maintains the architectural feature's integrity by avoiding overlap, which is crucial in illustrations that seek to emphasize tiered structures, commonly seen in configurable building designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the vertical lines and window patterns on the rectangular high-rise bookmark aligned and evenly spaced without warping or missing sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the rectangular high-rise bookmark, the vertical lines depicting the windows are consistently aligned and evenly spaced. Such precision is necessary in illustrating a high-rise building to convey the structural uniformity that is characteristic of modern skyscrapers. There is no evidence of warp or missing sections, maintaining the architectural realism and attention to detail seen in similar designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the gold and silver glazes on the bookmarks show consistent reflective highlights without scattered noise or unnatural glittering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decorative coloring on the bookmarks exhibits consistent use of gold and silver tones with well-controlled reflective highlights. The choice of glazing appears intentional and well-executed, avoiding scattered noise or unnatural glittering. Consistency in reflective highlights helps emulate the sophisticated look often achieved with metallic elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the etched outlines on all bookmarks continuous, unbroken, and aligned with the edges of the shapes without floating or intersecting incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The etched outlines on the bookmarks are observed to be continuous and adequately follow the contours of the shapes. Such alignment ensures the representation stays true to its design, with edges clearly marked, preventing any optical illusion that might result from incorrect intersection or floating contour lines.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the bookmarks positioned on the book with correct perspective and shadows that suggest they are resting on a flat surface without floating or overlapping unrealistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of the bookmarks on the book suggests accurate perspective and shadow play, indicating they are resting flat. Shadows and positioning consistent with physical grounding are essential to suggest realism in any depiction involving objects laying on a surface. This corroborates that there is no unrealistic floating or overlapping in the depiction.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stars and wave doodles are executed in a cartoon style that is visually consistent within the scene. They are placed strategically, adhering to the margins without overlapping or interfering with the bookmarks. Such placement is crucial to maintain aesthetic cohesion and visual balance in the overall layout.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection, there are no visible artifacts at the borders where the bookmarks interact with the book. Jagged edges, color bleeding, or ghosting are absent, indicating a meticulous approach to ensuring clean lines and color fidelity. This contributes to a polished and professional final appearance.",
