    "Question": "Q1: Does the male's shirt display a consistent 3D plush texture with no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural shading that breaks the illusion of depth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the male’s shirt is depicted with a plush, textured appearance consistent with a chibi or plush representation. The shirt's texture appears smooth and seamlessly integrated into the model's design without pixelation or unnatural shading. This consistency in texture and finish aids in maintaining the illusion of depth and quality typical in stylized figurines. This suggests a well-designed rendering typical of 3D plush materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the collar of the male's shirt proportionally enlarged without distorting the neck or shoulder line, and does it maintain smooth contours without sharp or broken edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the male's shirt is depicted with a prominent, rounded collar typical of chibi representations. The collar appears proportionally enlarged to fit the stylized form, maintaining a smooth contour without any distortion to the neck or shoulders. The contours are fluid, devoid of sharp or broken edges, fitting cohesively into the character's overall design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the pleats on the female's pants symmetrically arranged and physically plausible, without floating or overlapping layers that defy gravity or fabric tension?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the female's pants showcase pleats that are symmetrically arranged, typical of chibi or cartoonish designs. These pleats maintain a believable structure and would fall naturally in the context of stylized representation, considering the character's stance and form. There are no floating or overlapping layers that defy physical laws of gravity or fabric tension.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the enlarged sleeve on the female’s top extend naturally from the shoulder without distorting her arm or causing unnatural gaps or overlaps near the elbow and hand?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sleeve on the female's top is stylized and enlarged in a manner consistent with chibi designs. The sleeve extends naturally from the shoulder without visible distortion of the arm. The flow of the fabric is smooth, resting appropriately to showcase the intended form, without any unnatural gaps or overlaps near the elbow and hand.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the pastel-colored stage beneath the characters evenly lit and proportionally scaled, with no abrupt color shifts or shadow inconsistencies that suggest poor integration?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pastel-colored stage beneath the characters is evenly lit, contributing to a uniform appearance consistent across the surface. The stage fits proportionally to the characters, serving as a supportive base without abrupt color shifts or shadow inconsistencies that typically indicate poor integration in digital or 3D art.",
    "answer": "Yes"
