      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine of the elephant retain the natural grass-eating pose without introducing unnatural distortions or deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figurine of the elephant appears to be designed with a stylized, cute aesthetic common in chibi characterizations. The elephant has a bundle of green grass held in its trunk, resembling a natural pose similar to real elephants eating grass. The pose chosen for the figurine is simplified yet maintains the essence of a natural grass-eating posture, typical in chibi designs where features are exaggerated or simplified for aesthetic purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the elephant's skin in the figurine realistic, showing natural details without appearing overly smooth or artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skin texture of the elephant figurine in Image B appears smooth and simplified, which is stylistically consistent with chibi or toy designs where realism is often sacrificed for cuteness or artistic aesthetic. While it doesn't showcase hyper-realistic skin textures like wrinkles or natural imperfections, it doesn't need to as it serves an artistic purpose of capturing the essence of an elephant in a chibi form.",

      "question": "Does the base design mimic a muddy terrain naturally and complement the elephant figurine without creating visible gaps or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base design in Image B is simple, mimicking a ground-like texture with slight undulations. It complements the elephant figurine by providing a stable platform without noticeable gaps or inconsistencies. The design may not precisely replicate a muddy terrain but conveys the essence through its brown color and subtle texturing, aligning with the chibi aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transparent acrylic dome over the figurine clear and does it not cause distracting reflections or distortions on the figurine or the surrounding base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The acrylic dome in Image B effectively covers the figurine, appearing clear and without causing significant reflections or distortions that would distract from viewing the elephant and its base. Such designs are typically crafted to maintain visual clarity and enhance display, which appears to be successful here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there no noticeable artifacts, such as missing components or misplaced shadows, that disrupt the visual plausibility of the figurine scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, there are no apparent artifacts, missing components, or misplaced shadows that would disrupt the visual coherence of the figurine scene. The elements such as the figurine, base, and dome are integrated well, maintaining a consistent and plausible chibi-style aesthetic.",
