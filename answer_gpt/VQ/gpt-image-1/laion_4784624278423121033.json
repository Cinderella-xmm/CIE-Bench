    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the atom illustration placed in the same location as the original dough and does it have a smooth, continuous edge without jagged lines or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the atom illustration is located on the right side, replacing the original dough from Image A. In the edited image, the atom illustration is visually distinct with smooth and continuous lines, typical of a digital illustration, contrasting with the more uneven texture of the dough edge in Image A. Digitally illustrated shapes often have clean and uninterrupted lines, whereas hand-created textures (like the dough) might exhibit slight irregularities. Here, the atom illustration is consistently smooth, indicating a digital representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the additional atom-shaped cookies the same size as the original dough and do they have colors that blend naturally with the beige dough and wooden background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no additional atom-shaped cookies present. The focus is on the atom-shaped cookie cutter and the digital atom illustration. The colors in the edited image are designed for clear visual distinction rather than blending naturally with the background. When comparing with Image A, there was no presence of additional cookies, only a singular dough shape. The digital atom has distinct colors, which do not necessarily aim to mimic the blending of colors found in the physical environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arrows point directly to the correct parts of the atom (electrons, protons, neutrons) without crossing over or distorting the atomic shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrows are used to label the parts of the atom model and appear to be accurately directed towards the corresponding components: electrons, protons, and neutrons. They do not intersect each other or alter the atomic illustration. This type of clear and precise labeling is common in diagrammatic representations to avoid confusion and ensure accurate understanding, supporting the educational purpose of the illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the title text \"Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry\" clearly visible, positioned above the illustrations, and does it not overlap with the atom shapes or cookie cutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title text 'Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry' in Image B is prominently displayed at the top portion of the image, distinctively set apart from the atom illustration and the cookie cutter. It is clear and free from any overlapping, ensuring the text is legible and unobstructed. Good design practice in educational or explanatory graphics is to keep text separate from visual elements to maintain clarity and avoid clutter.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dotted lines straight, uniformly spaced, and positioned between sections without covering the atom illustrations or cookie cutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dotted line in Image B is neatly placed below the cookie cutter and above the atom illustration. It is straight and uniformly spaced, serving as a visual separator without interfering with or covering the other elements. Such a design approach enhances organization within the image and helps direct attention appropriately without cluttering or overlapping important illustrative content.",
