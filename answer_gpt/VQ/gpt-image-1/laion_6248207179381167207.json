      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the silver and turquoise geometric patterns evenly distributed across the handbag's surface without visible misalignment, stretching, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The turquoise and silver geometric patterns on Image B appear to be evenly distributed across the surface of the handbag. The patterns are symmetrical and maintain a consistent design, indicating that they have been properly aligned and placed with precision. There is no observable misalignment, stretching, or pixelation in the design, demonstrating attention to detail and craftsmanship in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic accents on the leather straps appear seamlessly integrated, with no sharp edges, inconsistent shading, or floating highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a handbag with visible metallic elements, but these are not on leather straps; they are part of the geometric design and frame. The metallic framing around the patterns is smoothly integrated with a consistent shading that reflects light appropriately, without sharp edges or floating highlights. The design suggests a cohesive integration of metallic elements in the overall design aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the machine-age engravings along the edges of the handbag continuous, properly aligned with the contours, and free from broken lines or overlapping patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The engravings seen along the edges of Image B's handbag are consistent and properly align with the contours. The engraved patterns appear continuous without any broken lines or overlapping elements. This results in an aesthetically pleasing and coherent edge design that appears well-executed.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the front pockets and zippered closure still clearly defined and structurally coherent, with no distortion in their shape or placement relative to each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, characteristics of pockets and a zippered closure typically found in handbags are not prominent. The image displays a solid frame-like casing with geometric patterns, suggesting a transformation from a traditional handbag style to a more rigid, decorative box design. This signifies that the structural elements such as front pockets or zippered closures from Image A are absent or have been stylistically removed, thus altering the coherence relative to each other as observed originally.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the transformed surfaces exhibit realistic material properties, such as subtle texture variation and appropriate light reflection, without appearing flat or digitally over-rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfaces on Image B exhibit realistic material properties characterized by texture variation and appropriate light reflection consistent with metallic surfaces. The design captures subtle shading and highlights, lending the material a three-dimensional appearance that avoids flatness. The combination of metallic sheen and turquoise provides an appealing contrast, suggesting a carefully considered edit that maintains realism without appearing over-rendered.",
