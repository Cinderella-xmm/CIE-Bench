    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the outlines around each rose petal uniform, continuous, and free of pixelation or irregular breaks that would indicate an unnatural transition from organic form to mosaic pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines around each rose petal maintain a uniformity and continuity that aligns with a mosaic pattern. This indicates a deliberate artistic choice to emphasize the structure in a stylized manner. The visual cues show clear, consistent lines without pixelation or breaks, which are characteristic of a digital mosaic style rather than a natural or photographic representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the petals exhibit smooth transitions between light and dark areas consistent with pearl-like reflectivity, and do the leaves show subtle jade-like translucency without visible texture distortion or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a mosaic style, where the petals are depicted with tiles that capture light and dark contrast. However, the visual style does not focus on pearl-like reflectivity or jade-like translucency; it emphasizes the mosaic's structured pattern rather than smooth light transitions typical of reflective or translucent materials. Therefore, the transitions are not focused on pearl-like qualities but rather on stylized mosaics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the architectural features like the arched window and corner pilasters preserved in shape and proportion despite being converted into terracotta-colored tiles, and do they align seamlessly with adjacent mosaic sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural features such as the arched window and pilasters are represented with mosaic tiles that retain the original shapes and proportions seen in Image A. The conversion into a mosaic style still preserves the essential structural elements, and these align well with the surrounding mosaic sections, indicating careful attention to pattern alignment and proportion in the stylization process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the mosaic rose bush maintain correct spatial placement relative to the building behind it, with no floating or misplaced elements suggesting incorrect depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial arrangement of the rose bush is consistent with the original photograph's depth and layering, maintaining a realistic placement against the building backdrop. The mosaic style does not hinder the depth perception or cause any elements to appear floating or misplaced, showing that the spatial relationship is correctly maintained.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details such as petal layers, leaf venation, and brick joints preserved in a stylized yet coherent manner, without appearing smeared, distorted, or replaced by flat, featureless surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates fine details like petal layers and brick joints through a mosaic technique, ensuring that details like leaf venation are stylized yet recognizable. This manner of presentation avoids smearing or distorting these elements and preserves them without reducing them to flat, featureless designs. The coherent mosaic style integrates these details into its aesthetic effectively.",
