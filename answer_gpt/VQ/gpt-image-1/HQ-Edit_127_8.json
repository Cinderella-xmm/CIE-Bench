      "question": "Are the stone towers, archway, and knight proportionally scaled and positioned correctly within the glass orb without geometric distortion or unnatural perspective shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone towers, archway, and knight appear to be well-proportioned and correctly placed within the glass orb. The image maintains a coherent perspective that visually matches the expectations of a miniature scene encapsulated in a globe. The spatial relationships between these elements are consistent, and there are no visible signs of distortion or unnatural perspective shifts. The curvature of the glass does not introduce significant optical distortions that would affect the perceived geometry of the objects inside.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the stone textures on the towers and gate retain fine detail and natural variation after being minified, without appearing overly smooth or pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stone textures on the towers and gate in Image B are finely detailed and show natural variation, even when scaled to fit within the glass orb. There is no indication of pixelation or oversmoothing – the textures appear realistic and maintain depth. The intricacies of the stonework are visible, which suggests careful attention to preserving detail during the minification process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the antique bronze finish applied uniformly to the knight’s armor and the gate, with realistic tarnish, reflections, and surface depth that match physical metal properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight’s armor and the gate exhibit a consistent antique bronze finish. The finish includes realistic tarnish and reflections typical of aged metal, contributing to the illusion of authenticity. Surface depth is managed well, imitating the natural properties of a metallic surface, especially under light conditions that suggest its curvature and texture.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the heraldic flags positioned correctly on the battlements, with natural folds and orientation suggesting movement in wind, and no clipping or floating artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flags in Image B are properly positioned on the battlements. They exhibit natural folds and orientations that convincingly suggest movement, as if caught in a gentle breeze. The folding patterns and overall flag behavior appear realistic, with no observable clipping or floating artifacts, which indicates attention to detail in the integration of these elements into the scene.",

      "question": "Are the tiny turrets and crenellated walls around the base of the orb evenly spaced, geometrically accurate, and stylistically consistent with the main castle structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiny turrets and crenellated walls surrounding the base of the orb are evenly spaced and maintain geometric accuracy. They are stylistically consistent with the main castle structure, ensuring that the miniature scene inside the orb remains visually coherent. The architectural details mirror the larger features effectively, reinforcing the integrity of the design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the golden rays integrated into the glass surface with proper refraction and depth, creating a seamless illusion of light emanating from within the orb without visible layering or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden rays in Image B are integrated smoothly into the glass surface, producing the illusion of light emanating from within. The refraction and depth of the rays are logically depicted, ensuring they blend seamlessly with the surrounding glass. There are no visible layering issues or edge artifacts that could disrupt the illusion, which helps to create a convincing effect of light permeating through the orb.",
