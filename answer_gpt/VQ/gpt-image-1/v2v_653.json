      "question": "Does the chibi version of the scientist retain the white lab coat and light blue shirt without any unnatural distortions in shape or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi versions of the scientist, who is depicted wearing a white lab coat and light blue shirt across all stickers. The shape and texture of the clothing appear consistent and appropriate for the chibi style, without distortions. This style simplification is common in chibi drawings, where detail is minimized for cuteness, but the overall representation remains. Thus the lab coat and shirt do retain their intended design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scientist's beard and hair depicted naturally in the chibi style, without any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi style depicted in Image B, the scientist has well-rendered hair that appears smooth and intentionally simplified for the style, which is standard for chibi designs where details are minimized. This effectively captures the hair's shape without introducing detail loss or unnatural textures. The depiction is consistent and charming within chibi style norms.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the background elements, including the bright green color and hexagonal patterns, enhance the chibi scientist stickers without causing any visual disruption or introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bright green backgrounds with hexagonal patterns complement the chibi scientist stickers by providing a thematic scientific look without any visible artifacts or disruptions. These elements visually align with the concept of the scientist, enhancing the stickers rather than obstructing them, maintaining clarity and coherence throughout.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "In all six poses, do the scientist's hands have the correct number of fingers and appear naturally shaped without any distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi scientist shown in Image B has hands represented with the correct number of fingers in each pose, which is consistent and correctly aligned with anatomical accuracy, simplified yet naturally shaped. This is within the expected rendering for chibi artwork, where the fingers are simplified but visually coherent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scientist's expressions and actions in all six poses coherent and visually plausible, without any unnatural or distorted features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi scientist stickers in Image B show a variety of expressions and actions that are rendered clearly and maintain coherence with chibi style norms. Each expression and action seems plausible, cute, and undistorted, effectively communicating different states and actions that are visually engaging and consistent.",
