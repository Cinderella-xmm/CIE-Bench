    "Question": "Q1: Are the enlarged knitting needles proportionally consistent with the size of the woman's hands and aligned naturally with her fingers without bending or stretching?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the knitting needles are held by the woman with a cartoonish appearance. The exaggerated features often seen in illustrations allow for some leeway in the exact proportions. The needles visually appear to fit well within the grasp of her illustrated hands, and their paths are aligned with her fingers without any significant bending or incorrect alignment. Therefore, they appear proportionally consistent and naturally aligned in the cartoon context.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the writing panel positioned within the open book pages such that its edges align naturally with the page boundaries and the knitted border matches the texture and color of the surrounding fabric?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a blank writing panel that does not clearly connect to an open book but is instead presented with a border that harmonizes with the knitting theme in the image. The yarn-like border seamlessly integrates with the overall fabric-related theme. Despite lacking direct alignment with a book format, it is graphically consistent with the rest of the image.",
