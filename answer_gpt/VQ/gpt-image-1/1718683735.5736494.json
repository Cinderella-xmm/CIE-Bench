      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine retain proportionally consistent limbs and head size relative to the body, avoiding unnatural elongation or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi-style art typically features exaggerated proportions, such as larger heads and smaller bodies, but these should still maintain a sense of proportional balance specific to this style. In Image B, the limbs and head are proportionally consistent with the chibi aesthetic, where the head is larger relative to the body, and the limbs are shorter but proportionate. The design does not appear unnaturally elongated or compressed beyond the characteristic chibi exaggeration.",

      "question": "Is the tricorne hat's shape preserved with clean edges and consistent material texture, free from distortions or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tricorne hat in Image B maintains a smooth, rounded shape with clean, defined edges, indicative of a well-crafted chibi accessory. The material texture appears consistent, and there is no indication of unnatural shading or distortion. The chibi style typically allows for some simplification, but the integrity of the shape and material is preserved.",

      "question": "Are the miniature treasure chest and spilled gold coins positioned with proper perspective and shadow alignment, ensuring they appear grounded and integrated into the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the treasure chest and gold coins exhibit proper perspective with clear shadow placement, anchoring them securely within the scene. The elements appear to sit naturally on the wooden base, with perspective and lighting contributing to their grounded appearance. There are no visible inconsistencies in the positioning or shadow alignment of these objects.",

      "question": "Do the tiny daggers and nautical motifs on the wooden deck appear fixed in place with consistent scale and orientation, avoiding floating or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tiny daggers and nautical motifs in Image B appear to be integrated into the scene, fixed in place on the wooden deck. Their scale is consistent with the chibi style, and they are correctly oriented, avoiding any impression of floating or misalignment. These elements enhance the thematic context of the figurine without disrupting visual coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands of the figurine have no more than five fingers, with naturally shaped knuckles and skin texture, and do they maintain proper grip on the treasure chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analysis of Image B, the hands of the chibi figurine are stylized in a way typical of chibi art, simplified yet retaining a proper grip on the treasure chest. They have a correctly stylized number of fingers, which are in line with the chibi aesthetic rather than realistic anatomy. The gripping position looks functional, and there is no unnatural distortion present.",
