    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal shards aligned with the cactus ribs and uniformly distributed without gaps or overlapping clusters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal shards are positioned at the top of the cactus, aligning with its structure. They emanate from the cactus peaks with a symmetrical and evenly spaced arrangement. Each shard appears distinct, with no visual overlap or clustering that would suggest disorganization. This orderly grouping indicates deliberate alignment along the ribs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the luminous glyphs follow the rib lines of the cactus and emit a soft glow without causing overexposure or halo effects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glyphs are positioned along the lines and creases of the cactus, resembling naturally occurring rib structures. They emit a subtle glow that enhances visibility without creating intense light effects such as overexposure or halos. The illumination seems balanced, indicating a soft glow consistent with a restrained lighting source.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the sandstone pedestal fully grounded on the wooden surface with natural texture and no floating or clipped edges?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the cactus resting on a sandstone pedestal which appears heavily textured to resemble natural stone. The base is grounded on a surface that looks like sand rather than a wooden one, as indicated by the cohesive continuity between the pedestal's base and the ground. There are no signs of clipping or floating edges, suggesting a stable placement.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the amber eyes embedded within the cactus ribs at symmetrical positions and do they show internal illumination without distorting the surrounding tissue?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the amber eyes are placed symmetrically, embedded within the cactus structure along its natural rib formations. This balance in placement suggests symmetry. Each eye emits a warm, internal glow, enhancing its presence without causing deformation or disruption to the surrounding green tissue, maintaining the cactus's intended form and structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the vine tendrils curve naturally around the pedestal and connect smoothly to the base without floating or rigid positioning?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vine tendrils exhibit a natural curvature as they wrap around the pedestal. They closely follow the stone's contours, hugging its surface and giving an impression of organic growth. The smooth transitions from the pedestal to the base and surrounding environment demonstrate a natural, integrated appearance without appearing rigid or detached.",
    "answer": "Yes"
