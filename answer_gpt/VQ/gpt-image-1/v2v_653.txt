    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi version of the scientist retain the white lab coat and light blue shirt without any unnatural distortions in shape or texture?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi versions of the scientist, who is depicted wearing a white lab coat and light blue shirt across all stickers. The shape and texture of the clothing appear consistent and appropriate for the chibi style, without distortions. This style simplification is common in chibi drawings, where detail is minimized for cuteness, but the overall representation remains. Thus the lab coat and shirt do retain their intended design.",
