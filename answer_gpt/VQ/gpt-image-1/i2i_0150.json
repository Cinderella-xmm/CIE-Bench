    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or visible edges where the forest background was replaced with the city balcony and skyline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, careful observation reveals that there are no obvious edges or unnatural textures suggesting a separation between the bird and its new urban background. The transition from the bird to the city skyline appears smooth, with consistent resolution and texture quality. The background integration looks well-executed, maintaining a realistic scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bird and the branch it stands on blend well with the city balcony setting, maintaining their structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is situated on a metal-like railing rather than a natural branch. The structure and positioning of the bird are consistent and credible within the context of an urban environment. The bird's texture and lighting integrate seamlessly with the artificial elements of the city backdrop, enhancing visual credibility.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the texture and structure of the branch remained intact and undistorted after replacing the forest background with a city balcony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is no longer perched on a branch but on a balcony railing. As such, there is no branch texture or structure to assess in the edited image. The absence of the branch means no distortion could be present, as it's been replaced with an appropriate setting element.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and relative sizes of the bird, branch, and city skyline appear physically plausible and natural in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the bird relative to the city skyline and balcony railing appear plausible. The bird is of a size typical for a small bird on a railing of this type and fits well into the urban environment. There doesn't appear to be any discrepancy in the scaling between these elements, supporting a natural composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting and shadow play on the bird, branch, and cityscape match naturally, contributing to the overall realism of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the bird and its surroundings appears cohesive and natural. The sunlit ambiance aligns with the shadowing on the bird and the city backdrop, resulting in a consistent and realistic lighting scheme throughout the image.",
