      "question": "Does the mango retain its recognizable shape and texture in the 8-bit pixel art style without appearing overly distorted or unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango has been converted into 8-bit pixel art style. Evaluating its shape, it still appears as a round or oval object typical of a mango, and its color is distinctly close to that of a mango. While the texture is simplified due to pixelation, it doesn't appear overly distorted or unnatural. The reduction in detail is consistent with the typical characteristics of 8-bit art which prioritizes simplicity and abstraction while maintaining recognizable form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the table and napkin depicted with consistent structure and proportions in the 8-bit pixel art style, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or disproportionate elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the table is rendered with straight edges, and the napkin maintains its general folded form albeit simplified with pixelation. These objects retain consistent proportions relative to each other, characteristic of what you would expect in 8-bit art. The geometric structure is preserved without any elements appearing broken or distorted, supporting a uniform appearance across the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the fine details of the mango's surface and the napkin's texture remain discernible in the 8-bit pixel art style, without significant loss or introduction of unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, 8-bit pixel art inherently simplifies and abstracts fine details, which results in a loss of intricate texture compared to more detailed images. The surface of the mango and the napkin's texture are generalized into block color patterns. While these patterns are not explicitly detailed, within 8-bit pixel art conventions, they are not unnaturally introduced but expected due to the medium's abstraction. Therefore, fine detail is less discernible but naturally so in this context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadow effects on the mango and table in the 8-bit pixel art style appear natural and plausible, without introducing any obvious artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, shadows and lighting effects are translated into simplified blocks of darker and lighter colors. These effects align with the object's shapes and positions in accordance with the direction of light casting shadows uniformly across the scene. The visual representation of lighting and shadow follows consistent logic expected in pixel art, maintaining plausible coherence without artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition and layout of the mango, napkin, and table in the 8-bit pixel art style visually credible and structurally sound, without any elements appearing misplaced or out of context?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition respects the positioning and relationship observed in more detailed settings. The mango is centrally placed on the napkin, which is atop the table. Arrangement within pixel art maintains spatial coherence and the structural integrity expected in real-life scenarios. This layout doesn't appear misplaced or contextually inappropriate in comparison to Image A's realistic depiction.",
