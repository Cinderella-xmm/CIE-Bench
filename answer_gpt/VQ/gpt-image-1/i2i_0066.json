      "question": "Do the 3D printed display model and display plaque appear naturally integrated into the image, without disrupting the scene’s overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D printed display model and plaque are placed on a table within a tech expo booth setting. The lighting and shadows are consistent with the indoor environment, with the model and plaque both having appropriate proportions and alignment. The integration appears smooth, adhering to realistic spatial relationships and does not disrupt the scene’s authenticity.",

      "question": "Does the texture of the 3D printed model resemble matte PLA plastic realistically, without showing any unnatural surface irregularities or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the 3D printed model has a consistent matte finish typical of PLA plastic used in 3D printing. The detail in the model is smooth and uniform without any visible surface irregularities or artifacts. This resembles a typical 3D printed texture, contributing to its realistic portrayal.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the display plaque at the base positioned correctly, maintaining structural consistency and contributing to the visual credibility of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display plaque is aligned with the base, and its placement appears structurally sound. The proportions are suitable for the described item, maintaining visual credibility and consistency within the scene. The positioning does not seem awkward or unnatural.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the transition between the original elements and the new tech expo booth background appear seamless, avoiding any obvious artifacts or unnatural segmentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the transition between the 3D printed display and the tech expo booth background, there are no visible seams or unnatural artifacts. The lighting and perspective are consistent, allowing a seamless blend into the new background. This contributes positively to the image authenticity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the 3D printed model and the display plaque realistic and consistent with what one would expect in a real-world scenario, avoiding any noticeable distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions of both the 3D printed model and the display plaque are appropriate for a real-world exhibition. They maintain consistent scale and alignment relative to each other and the surrounding environment, which avoids distortion and contributes to realistic representation.",
