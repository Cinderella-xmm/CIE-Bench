    "Question": "Q1: Does the table appear transformed into a tea box lid with consistent geometry and engraved leaf patterns that follow natural contours without warping or breaking the surface structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the table space is represented as part of a tea packaging design, with a focus on consistent geometric shapes and engraved patterns that are typical of a detailed, intentional product design. The transition to a tea box lid involves ensuring that the engraved leaf motifs appear naturally contoured and cohesive with the surface plane. The design execution in Image B involves clear, continuous lines of the leaf patterns that do not exhibit warping or surface inconsistencies, thereby maintaining a structurally believable transformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the replaced cups depicted with clear, detailed sustainable material textures (such as fibrous or layered patterns) that appear natural and integrated into the scene without visible artifacts or blurring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cups are designed to appear as made from a sustainable material, requiring intricate textural details that suggest fibrous or layered characteristics. The cups in this image display a well-defined texture that suggests a crafted material surface, avoiding any visible digital artifacts or blurring which would indicate artificial edit flaws. The natural appearance of these textures ensures an impression of realistically integrated materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the tag with the text 'Zen Autumn Tea' clearly legible, stylistically consistent with the scene’s aesthetic, and seamlessly integrated with proper lighting and shadow alignment to avoid appearing pasted on?",
    "explanation": "The tag in Image B needs to appear as an authentic part of the product design, which means that it should exhibit clear legibility and maintain an aesthetic congruency with the overall tea theme portrayed. The text 'Zen Autumn Tea' is presented in a manner consistent with the rustic, earthy aesthetic of the scene. Additionally, the integration of lighting and shadow around the tag ensures it fits naturally into its setting and does not look artificially attached, preserving scene cohesion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the teapot reshaped into a leaf contour with smooth, continuous edges and natural-looking earthy textures that do not show distortion, clipping, or unnatural color gradients?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot has been redesigned to exemplify a leaf contour, characteristic of thematic product styling. The edges are observed as smooth and uninterrupted, avoiding any visual errors such as distortion or clipping that would detract from a cohesive shape. Furthermore, the teapot’s earthy textures are consistent, presenting no unnatural color gradients that would suggest poor image manipulation, thus enhancing the realism of this edited object.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do all edited elements (tea box lid, sustainable cups, brand tag, leaf-shaped teapot) align with the original lighting direction and cast consistent shadows, maintaining spatial harmony and depth without floating or misaligned components?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes several edited elements that must collectively conform to a unified light source and perspective, to sustain spatial credibility. These elements—the tea box lid, sustainable cups, brand tag, and leaf-shaped teapot—are integrated with respect to a consistent lighting direction, ensuring proper shading and shadow projection that correlate with the scene’s depth and avoid giving any appearance of detachment or spatial oddity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
