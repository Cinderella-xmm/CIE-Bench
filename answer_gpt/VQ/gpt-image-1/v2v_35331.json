    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transition between the dog and the banana appear smooth and natural without any visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana seamlessly replaces the body of the dog, connecting with its feet and the ears on top. The transition area between the dog's legs and the banana skin is smooth, without visible seams or misaligned edges, blending the two elements naturally.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the dog and the banana consistent with each other and the surrounding grass, indicating a natural light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a consistent lighting source that illuminates both the banana and the dog's ears in a similar manner, with uniform shadows on the grass. This consistency in lighting corroborates a natural light source impacting all elements in the scene similarly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or loss of fine details where the dog and the banana connect, disrupting the visual quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The integration of the banana with the dog's features in Image B is well-executed, maintaining the crisp texture of both the banana peel and the natural appearance of the dog's ears. The transition retains detail without obvious textural discrepancies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the dog and the banana remain realistic and proportional to each other, avoiding any unnatural stretching or shrinking?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions in Image B appear exaggerated as the size of the banana body relative to the small size of the dog's feet suggests an unnatural size relation, deviating from realistic proportions seen in Image A, where the dog and banana are separate but appropriately sized.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the materials of the dog's fur and the banana's peel retain their natural texture and appearance, contributing to the overall realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the texture of the dog's fur, seen on its ears, and the surface of the banana skin both maintain their authentic appearances, enriching the visual realism by preserving their inherent textural qualities.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
