      "question": "Does the transition between the train and the cyberpunk background appear seamless without obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition between the train and the cyberpunk background can be assessed by looking at how well the elements from different environments blend together. In Image B, the train has been integrated into a bright, neon-lit scene typical of cyberpunk aesthetics. The texture and color of the train match the tones and lighting of the background, creating a cohesive and smooth integration without noticeable misalignments or jarring edges. This seamless blending suggests a high-quality editing process.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the reflections of neon lights on the train surface realistic and consistent with the expected behavior of light in a cyberpunk setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reflections of neon lights on surfaces in a cyberpunk setting are expected to be vibrant and dynamic, accentuating the contours of objects like the train. In Image B, the reflections are brightly colored and appear to follow the train's surface contours accurately, consistent with how light would behave in such a setting. These reflections enhance the train's presence in the scene without disrupting realism.",

      "question": "Do the added headphones on the driver look natural and do they preserve the driver's visibility without obscuring important features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the headphones look natural, we examine how they fit the character’s proportions and how they integrate into the existing scene. Despite the face being blurred, the headphones appear to be well-placed and scaled for the character’s profile, aligning with the cyberpunk aesthetic. They do not overpower or obscure any crucial aspects that alter the intended appearance or visibility significantly.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the motion blur effect applied in a way that suggests movement without causing the train to appear distorted or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Motion blur is used to convey dynamism and speed while preserving clarity of main features. In Image B, the motion blur enhances the feeling of movement both of the skateboarder and the train without deforming the train or losing its distinct edges and details. The blur is subtle yet effective, indicating forward movement and maintaining the train’s integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall transformed image maintain a consistent edgy and cool style without introducing conflicting or out-of-place elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed image successfully incorporates elements like neon lights, motion blur, and modern accessories to build a cyberpunk atmosphere, aligning with themes of edginess and cool style. The harmonization of colors, setting, and characters without introducing elements that appear out-of-place contributes to this cohesive style, ensuring nothing conflicts with the established aesthetic.",
