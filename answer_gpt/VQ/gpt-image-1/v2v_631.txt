    "Question": "Q1: Does the character's face retain its natural proportions and features without any visible distortion or unnatural textures after being rendered in a 3D cartoon style?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), despite the facial features being blurred, the overall contour and proportion of the face appear consistent with expectations for a 3D cartoon representation. Typically, such rendering smooths the features and aligns them proportionally with the rest of the character design. Given these aspects, it is reasonable to conclude that the face retains its natural proportions and features without visible distortion or unnatural textures.",
