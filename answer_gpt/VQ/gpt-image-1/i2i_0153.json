      "question": "Does the truck maintain its original proportions and structural integrity without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is depicted in a stylized, cartoonish manner which simplifies its proportions but retains structural integrity. Visually, the shape, key features, and parts like the cab, wheels, and exhaust are portrayed without distortion, consistent with a stylized artistic style where shapes can appear slightly exaggerated but are not broken or geometrically incorrect. Compared to Image A, which shows a realistic depiction of the truck, Image B maintains the recognizable structure of a semi-truck. Thus, the truck's portrayal aligns with artistic consistency, maintaining overall proportions appropriate for a cartoon representation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces and textures of the truck, such as the wheels, cab, and grille, free from unnatural artifacts and retain appropriate levels of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, adopting a cartoon style, naturally reduces the level of detail compared to a realistic image. The surfaces and textures are represented with flat colors and simple lines, typical of a cartoon aesthetic. As per the art style, no unnatural artifacts or visual errors like pixelation are present. While detail is reduced compared to Image A's realism, this does not detract from the artistic intent and readability of the image. The design reflects a considered choice rather than artifact presence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cab's vibrant colors appear natural against the truck's materials and lighting conditions, ensuring material consistency and avoiding unrealistic contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses bold, flat colors consistent across its cartoon aesthetic, with the cab's red being vivid but appropriately balanced with other colors like black and silver for the wheels and chrome parts. The color scheme is cohesive, adhering to simplified lighting without visible shadows or highlights, which is suitable for this style. In comparison, Image A's realistic lighting would involve gradients and reflective qualities. Image B's color choices comply with, rather than contrast, its flat, illustrative design. No unrealistic contrasts are evident.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the simplified background naturally integrated with the truck, maintaining the overall authenticity of the scene without introducing distracting or out-of-place elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background complements the truck, using similarly simplified trees and sky to harmonize with the truck's cartoon style. The reduced detail ensures focus remains on the truck without distraction. This consistency in artistic reduction avoids elements that seem out of place or mismatched within the scene. Relative to Image A, the background loses realistic depth, yet remains contextually appropriate for its aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wheels maintain their structural and physical logic, with no signs of distortion or misalignment, thereby preserving the truck's visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels are depicted in a coherent manner that logically aligns with the truck's design despite the artistic style. They remain circular and are placed correctly relative to the body, preserving the truck's structural coherence. No misalignment or illogical positioning is evident. Comparing this with Image A's realistic depiction, Image B simplifies but maintains spatial correctness of the wheels, upholding its visual credibility within its cartoon portrayal.",
