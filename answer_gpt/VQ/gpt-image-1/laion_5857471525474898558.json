    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the LEGO-style bricks on the building facade uniformly sized, aligned in rows, and free from visible texture repetition or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building is constructed from LEGO bricks that are known for their uniform size and regular alignment. The facade consists of several rows of bricks which appear to be consistently sized and do not exhibit signs of texture repetition or blurring typical of physical LEGO bricks. This consistent appearance is due to the nature of LEGO bricks which are mass-produced with high precision.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the window frames appear as solid, blocky LEGO elements with consistent thickness and alignment, matching the original window positions and sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The window frames in Image B are built from LEGO bricks, which inherently possess a solid and blocky form due to their construction style. These window frames maintain consistent thickness and alignment, fitting neatly within the LEGO structure, which mirrors the orderly design style of LEGO construction. Although they are transformed into LEGO style, they align well with the intended positions and aesthetic of a typical LEGO building.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the green LEGO vines grow along the same vertical paths as the original plants, maintaining segmented, blocky forms without stretching or breaking continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green vines are composed of distinct LEGO bricks, which naturally result in a segmented and blocky appearance. They appear to grow in a vertical path similar to climbing vines, maintaining continuity without stretching or breaking due to the nature of LEGO brick connections, which are designed to be secure and structured, emulating the path of the vines in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gray LEGO railings on each balcony evenly spaced, horizontally aligned, and securely connected to the balcony base without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the LEGO representation of the building in Image B, the gray railings appear evenly spaced and horizontally aligned due to the modular nature of LEGO pieces. They are securely connected to what appears to be the balcony base, as there is no indication of them floating or improperly overlapping. This reflects the precision and standardized size of LEGO components.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a flat, level platform extending beneath the entire building base, positioned consistently with the sidewalk and not overlapping with parked vehicles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, as a LEGO model, usually sits on a solid, flat platform, characteristic of LEGO base plates. However, there is no visible sidewalk or parked vehicles; instead, the focus is the LEGO structure itself resting on its base, typical of standalone Lego models. There appears to be no overlap or intersection with non-LEGO items as it stands alone.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do all architectural elements—including windows, doors, balconies, and rooflines—remain in their original positions and maintain proper alignment and spacing relative to one another?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural elements like windows, doors, balconies, and rooflines are structured as one would find in a precise LEGO construction. Each element is proportionately placed, maintaining alignment typical of a LEGO building, though they have been LEGO-fied from their real life positions. The intent and layout are logically consistent with typical building architecture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, color bleeding, or sharp edges at the borders between the LEGO building and the sky, trees, or parked cars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which exclusively features the LEGO building against a plain background, there are no interactions with the sky, trees, or parked cars as in a real environment. The borders appear crisp and free from color bleeding or mismatched edges, adhering to the well-defined boundaries typical of LEGO constructions.",
