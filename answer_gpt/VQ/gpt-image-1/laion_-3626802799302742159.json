    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) and limbs added to the cookies smooth, proportionally consistent with the cookie size, and free from pixelation or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies have facial features including eyes and mouths, and limbs such as arms and legs. The features appear smooth and proportionally consistent with the size of the cookies. They do not show signs of pixelation or jagged edges, which indicates careful editing and a cartoon-style design. The smoothness and consistency are evident in the uniform shapes and symmetrical placement relative to the cookie surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the floral pattern on the transformed plate appear continuous, evenly distributed, and consistent with fabric texture, without visible seams or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plate has been transformed into a fabric-like texture with a floral pattern. The pattern looks continuous and evenly distributed, suggesting a mat or rug placed on the wooden surface. The floral designs are consistently spaced, and there is no visible seam or unnatural stretching, which indicates a well-executed editing process to seamlessly integrate the pattern into the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the added miniature chairs and tea table positioned within the cup and around it in a way that respects physical proportions and does not cause overlapping or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature chairs and tea table are positioned around the cookies that are arranged to look like they are sitting at a tea party. The positions appear to respect proportions, as the elements do not overlap or float unrealistically. The chairs and table are correctly placed on the patterned 'fabric,' maintaining proper contact with the surface, which ensures a realistic representation of a miniature setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the facial expressions on the cookies (grinning, pouting, winking) show clear differentiation in mouth and eye shapes while maintaining symmetry and natural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cookies in Image B display facial expressions such as grinning, pouting, and winking. The differences in mouth and eye shapes are noticeable, with each expression clearly defined. The features maintain symmetry, and the curvature is natural and fitting with the cartoon style. Each cookie's face shows distinct emotions that are clearly rendered, indicating quality editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the positions of the cookie characters, chairs, and tea table arranged in a way that suggests stable contact with surfaces and realistic depth, without floating or misplaced objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies are arranged as characters around a miniature tea table setting, suggesting depth and stable contact with the surface. The chairs and table stand firmly on the fabric, simulating realistic interaction with the environment. There are no signs of objects floating or being misplaced, which demonstrates an understanding of physical positioning and depth in the editing process.",
