      "question": "Do the zebras maintain their signature striped coats with no unnatural texture or loss of detail in the chibi-style 3D recreation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras appear in a chibi-style 3D recreation, characterized by an exaggerated, toy-like appearance. Despite this alteration of style, the distinctive black and white stripes are preserved. However, the texture is more smooth and simplified compared to realistic zebras, reflecting a chibi aesthetic rather than realistic detail. This is a common stylistic choice in chibi representation where details are simplified for artistic effect.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lush green field and fencing preserved in a photorealistic manner without any visible distortion or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The greenery and the fencing in Image B appear nearly identical to those in Image A, maintaining clarity and realistic texture. The photorealistic background contrasts with the chibi zebras, suggesting the background has been preserved without significant alteration or visible artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the zebras retain their realistic grazing stances without any distortion or deformation in the chibi-style 3D recreation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are recreated in a chibi style which inherently includes distortion such as a large head and small body. While they mimic the grazing stance, their overall proportions and poses are altered to fit the chibi aesthetic, thus deviating from realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the ornate decorative photo frame integrate seamlessly with the scene without disrupting the visual coherence or introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frame in Image B surrounds the scene but creates a visual separation between the chibi-style zebras and the photorealistic background. While it stands out, it doesn't introduce unnatural artifacts beyond providing a stylistic border, serving as an intentional artistic addition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition between the chibi-style 3D zebras and the photorealistic background smooth and believable without any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The contrast between the chibi 3D zebras and the photorealistic background in Image B is clear and intentional. While the styles differ drastically, there aren't any apparent artifacts at the junction between foreground and background, maintaining overall visual harmony in the scene.",
