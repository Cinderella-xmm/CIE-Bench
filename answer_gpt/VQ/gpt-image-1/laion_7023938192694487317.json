    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the torso appear uniformly scaled and proportionally enlarged without visible warping or stretching of anatomical features such as shoulders, neck, or waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the torso of the figurine seems symmetrically proportioned and structured, suggesting a deliberate and accurate sculpting typical in such products. The shoulders, neck, and waist display consistent diameters and angles, indicative of expert design and construction without distortion or uneven proportions. This outcome aligns with world knowledge about the manufacturing of collectible figurines, which require precision to maintain aesthetic appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the surface of the shirt uniformly matte with no glossy highlights or fabric weave patterns, indicating a polymer-like finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a shirt surface that appears smooth and evenly lit without any visible glossiness or texture. This suggests a matte finish often found in polymer materials, commonly used for figurine creation. In contrast to the real fabric with texture patterns or sheen due to lighting, the simplistic look is typical of modeled fabric.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the \"Craft\" logo clearly visible, elevated in appearance, and rendered in bold colors without blurring, misalignment, or clipping at its edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Craft' logo is distinctly pronounced and clear, preserving edge sharpness, robust color, and appropriate alignment. The logo exhibits no blurring or clipping, attributes significant in high-quality figurine production, as OEM services ensure accurate rendition of such detail-oriented features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the base under the figurine composed of clean, straight lines with smooth surfaces and subtle reflective highlights consistent with polished metal, and does it appear physically attached yet separable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the figurine in Image B is characterized by sleek, straight lines and a smooth finish that imply a solid, polished metal quality. Its construction suggests separability typical of display bases, where the bottom part appears detachable, while still being securely mounted.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features, including eyes, beard, glasses, and skin texture, preserved without distortion, blurring, or unnatural blending at the junction with the modified torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are deliberately blurred, intentionally omitting focus on those details according to given instructions. Therefore, it's not applicable to assess retention or clarity of features like eyes, beard, or glasses, as the focus lies on the torso and other depicted elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Not applicable due to blurred face.",
