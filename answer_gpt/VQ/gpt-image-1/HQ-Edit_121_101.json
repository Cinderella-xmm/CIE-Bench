        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow on the jeogori is centrally and symmetrically positioned. The surrounding fabric folds are smooth, displaying a natural flow without any signs of creasing or distortion. This alignment ensures visual harmony and supports the traditional style depicted.",

      "question": "Do the roof lines and structural components of the background architecture maintain proper alignment and perspective, avoiding skewed angles or floating elements that suggest structural inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof lines and structural components are depicted with proper alignment and perspective. There are no skewed angles or elements that appear floating or inconsistent with traditional architectural lines, ensuring the realistic depiction of the building.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an embossed leather-bound panel with uniform texture across its surface. The stamped elements meet the background seamlessly without visible irregularities, offering a consistent depth impression typical of high-quality embossing work.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the chain have exactly five fingers with natural joint curvature and skin texture, and does the chain follow a continuous, non-intersecting path without breaking or appearing detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain the detail of a hand holding a chain as it depicts stylized illustrations on what appears to be stamps. Therefore, this aspect is not applicable to the edited image.",
