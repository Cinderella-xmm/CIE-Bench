      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the areas previously featuring stitched embroidery (on the shaft and vamp) now display consistent metallic inlay textures with no visible seams, texture breaks, or mismatched gloss levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show that the boot has a metallic inlay texture throughout its design, replacing the usual stitched embroidery. The metallic design shows no visible seams or interruptions, and the texture appears consistent. Reflecting on world knowledge, a seamless metallic finish would not display textural breaks or mismatched gloss levels unless it was poorly executed. The consistent shine and uniform appearance verify that these areas were edited carefully to simulate a metallic finish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the newly designed stepped heel structurally aligned with the sole and boot shaft, with clean geometric edges and no floating or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heel has a structured, stepped design integrated with the overall boot style, consistent with the metallic theme. The heel is visually aligned with the sole and shaft, exhibiting geometric precision in its structure. World knowledge about shoe design ensures that misalignment would typically be noticeable if present, either through floating sections or edges that don't line up cleanly. The heel's clean geometric edges and integrated design reflect a well-executed structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the transformed patterns along the shaft and toe area composed of sharp, consistent geometric lines without distorting the boot's outline or causing unnatural swelling or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the boot's shaft and toe area are geometric and sharply defined, in sync with the metallic appearance of the boot. The lines are consistent and do not cause any distortions to the boot's natural outline. World knowledge indicates that sharp geometric designs require precise execution to avoid any distortion or unnatural shaping. The visual evidence in Image B shows these patterns preserve the boot's silhouette.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the metallic inlays exhibit uniform specular highlights without bright spots, halos, or uneven reflections that suggest digital noise or over-processing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the boot with metallic inlays that have a uniform sheen across the surface. There are no bright spots, halos, or uneven reflections visible, which might indicate digital noise or over-processing. In the design of metallic objects, uniform reflection without excessive bright spots points to proper rendering or photography. The observed highlights indicate a controlled and consistent finish on the metal surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the boot maintain a natural foot-shaped profile with properly proportioned toe box, ankle, and shaft height, without unnatural elongation, compression, or asymmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot retains a natural foot-shape profile, with the toe box, ankle, and shaft height appearing well-proportioned. There is no visible elongation, compression, or asymmetry, which would be easily detectable as irregular joint or limb shapes. Knowledge of footwear design emphasizes the importance of maintaining proportional anatomy in wearable footwear, and the boot in Image B adheres to these norms.",
