    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the text 'Stories Through Time' rendered in a serif font with a distressed gold texture that matches the typewriter’s material and color tone, and does it appear seamlessly integrated into the image without overlapping or obscuring key objects like the typewriter or lamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Stories Through Time' is rendered in a serif font that appears classic and refined, which is typical for conveying timelessness and historical significance. The distressed gold texture complements the antique appearance of the typewriter and the overall color tone of the edited image. Furthermore, the placement of the text is such that it does not interfere with or obscure the view of key objects like the typewriter or lamp, which are pivotal to the compositional aesthetic. Therefore, the integration looks thoughtful and harmonious.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the sepia filter apply evenly across all elements—such as the wooden desk, typewriter, lamp, and wall—without causing uneven color shifts, loss of texture detail, or artificial flattening of shadows and highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sepia filter in Image B brings a uniformity to the color tone by giving the entire image a vintage feel. The wooden desk, typewriter, lamp, and wall all maintain their respective textures and details despite the filter application. Shadows and highlights are preserved in a natural manner, supporting a balanced depth and atmosphere typical of sepia-toned imagery. This indicates an even application without any notable imbalances or texture losses.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ghostly pages positioned around the typewriter in a flowing, semi-transparent manner, avoiding sharp edges or unnatural overlaps with solid objects like the typewriter body or desk surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ghostly pages appear to emanate seamlessly from the typewriter, flowing upwards in a manner that suggests ethereal movement. These pages are semi-transparent, which helps them blend with the environment without any harsh edges or awkward intersections with solid objects such as the typewriter body or the desk. The artistry used excels in creating a visually compelling scene that avoids unrealistic overlaps or conflicting elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Art Deco border present along the edges of the image, featuring symmetrical geometric patterns and consistent thickness, without cutting into or distorting any central elements like the typewriter or lamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, includes an Art Deco-style border that encompasses the whole frame with geometric symmetry characteristic of the Art Deco movement. This border is consistently thick and does not intrude upon or distort central elements like the typewriter or lamp. This design choice contributes to a cohesive visual style, enhancing the vintage aura while preserving the integrity and visibility of the primary subjects within the frame.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the typewriter retain its original shape, alignment of keys, and mechanical structure without visible deformation, stretching, or broken geometry despite the addition of new elements like text and ghostly pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the typewriter maintains its authentic shape, the alignment of keys, and its detailed mechanical structure. The introduction of text and ghostly pages does not compromise its geometry or cause distortion. The typewriter appears intact and realistically rendered, supporting the narrative theme without sacrificing its physical depiction.",
