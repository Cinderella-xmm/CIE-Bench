      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and skin texture on the elderâ€™s face naturally rendered without excessive smoothing or artificial cartoon-like distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall style is illustrative, and the focus is on a stylized and decorative representation rather than realistic rendering of textures, such as facial wrinkles and skin texture. The appearance leans toward a cartoon-like or illustrative distortion, where fine details like facial wrinkles and texture are simplified or omitted in favor of a smoother, more generic look typical of artwork styles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the floral patterns on the hanbok and surrounding foliage display consistent detail and alignment without visible repetition or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the hanbok and the surrounding foliage are part of an illustrated, stylized image rather than a high-resolution photograph. The design emphasizes clean, consistent details typical of illustrations. The elements are purposefully aligned and do not exhibit signs of repetition or blurring that might suggest a mechanical or artificial application of patterns.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gradient transition across the hanbok's fabric smooth and continuous, with no sharp color breaks or unnatural banding effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hanbok is rendered in a simplified, stylized manner, characteristic of illustrative art. While the transitions between colors are part of the artistic style, they are simplified and might not exhibit the same level of smooth, continuous gradients as seen in a photographic image. The artistic intention may mean that the transitions are more abrupt or stylized.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the green vine accents positioned behind the subject and aligned with the depth of the background, without appearing to float above or through solid structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green vine accents are part of the illustrative background, designed to enhance the aesthetic of the artwork. They are positioned within a uniform flat plane typical of illustrations, where depth and 3D alignment are interpreted stylistically. The elements do not appear to float or disrupt the structure intended by the illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the envelope frame fully aligned with the image boundaries, with no jagged edges, clipping errors, or mismatched shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the envelope frame is part of the graphic design and is intended to enclose the subject in a neat and unified manner. The illustrative style would maintain a smooth and integrated boundary, eliminating the possibility of visible errors like jagged edges or clipping. The artistic style naturally supports clean lines and alignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the edges of the hair, fabric folds, and floral elements sharp and clean without jagged lines, pixelation, or ghosting artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, edges are rendered cleanly as part of a digitally created illustrative work. The artistic approach ensures that contours like the edges of hair, fabric folds, and floral elements are smooth and well-defined without exhibiting rough or pixelated qualities, which are replaced by clear lines typical to digital illustrations.",
