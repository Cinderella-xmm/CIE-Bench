    "Question": "Q1: Do the cartoon versions of the two boys have proportionally correct head shapes and facial features that align with typical human anatomy, without exaggerated or distorted geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon versions of the boys are depicted with exaggerated features typical of cartoon styles, such as large, round eyes and simplistic features that deviate from realistic human anatomy. However, these features align with common artistic liberties taken in cartoon design, where proportions are intentionally altered for artistic expression and appeal. Therefore, while the features are stylized, they are correct within the context of the medium.",
