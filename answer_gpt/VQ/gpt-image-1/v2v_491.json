      "question": "Does the bear maintain precise proportions and intricate fur details in its anime-inspired form without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a bear that appears to be a stylized or toy-like version rather than a realistic form. The body and fur details are simplified, which is typical in anime or cartoon-inspired representations. This means that the bear does not maintain precise proportions or intricate fur details as a real bear would, introducing certain stylizations or distortions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the bear's fur natural and free of any obvious artifacts in the anime-inspired figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear's texture is more akin to a toy or a fictional character, with smoother and less detailed fur resembling a manufactured item rather than a natural texture. Such simplification is common in anime-inspired or toy models, and while it lacks natural detail, there are no clear artifacts typical of editing errors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the backpack realistically scaled down and positioned next to the bear on the desk, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backpack in Image B appears smaller and seems to be a scaled down model next to the toy-like bear figure on a desk. This appearance and setup can be due to the toy-like nature of the figure, making the arrangement look intentionally designed and providing visual consistency in that context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bear's emotive eyes retain their fine details and appear natural without any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bear in Image B does not feature realistic eyes as it appears to be a stylized or toy model. The details are understandably simplified and cartoonish in design, consistent with the object's overall stylized nature rather than being a case of lost detail or unnatural texturing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and lighting of the scene, including the bear and the backpack, convey a casual, natural vibe similar to a smartphone capture without any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is consistent with indoor, artificial light which provides a clear view of objects positioned on a desk. The scene appears well-composed without noticeable artifacts and conveys the look of a carefully arranged scene, akin to a promotional photograph or enthusiast capture rather than an impromptu smartphone shot.",
