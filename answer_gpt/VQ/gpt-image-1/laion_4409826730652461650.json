      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and mouth of the horse in both panels correctly positioned and proportionally consistent with the original plush design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartoonish representation of a horse, which is a stylized rendition of the plush horse in Image A. The eyes and mouth in Image B have been exaggerated to fit a cartoon style, making them appear larger and more expressive compared to the realistic plush design in Image A. While the cartoon style may differ in placement and proportion, it serves the purpose of conveying emotion more vividly in a cartoon. Thus, the elements are consistent within the confines of artistic stylization.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lasso above the horse's head shaped naturally and positioned so that it appears to be twirling in mid-air without intersecting or clipping through the horse's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lasso is drawn in a cartoon style, showing it clearly above the horse's head in a looped form, suggesting motion associated with twirling. There are no visual cues indicating that the lasso intersects or clips through the horse's body. The positioning and shape align with what would be expected for a lasso in motion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cacti and wooden saloon buildings in the background align with the horizon line and cast shadows consistent with the light source direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cacti and saloon buildings are drawn in a simplistic cartoon style, and due to this stylistic choice, the shadows and alignments are not detailed. The objects appear straightforward and basic, so there is no explicit indication of inconsistent shadow or alignment with the horizon line.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fur texture of the horse and the plastic details of the rocking base clearly visible and not blurred or oversimplified due to stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a cartoon rendering, which inherently simplifies textures and details like fur and plastic details to maintain a coherent cartoon look. Consequently, the horse's fur texture and the plastic details of the rocking base have been simplified and stylized, lacking the detail and realism seen in Image A. The purpose of the cartoon is to convey a playful or vibrant aesthetic rather than a high level of detail.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text “Wild, Wild Horse Adventures!” positioned at the top of the image without overlapping any part of the horse or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible text such as “Wild, Wild Horse Adventures!” in the provided frames. Therefore, the question of whether it overlaps with parts of the horse or background elements does not apply.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the legs and rocking base of the horse proportionally accurate and aligned with the original mechanical structure, even after stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs and rocking base have been stylized in a cartoonish manner. While the original mechanical structure of Image A's plush horse is absent, the cartoon follows its own schema, with rounded and exaggerated features fitting a playful style. Though mechanically different in stylization, it retains congruence with the overall aesthetic of the cartoon representation.",
