      "question": "Are the roof, walls, and window frames of the Japanese house replaced with colored glass panels outlined by black lead without distorting the original building’s geometry or introducing misaligned or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a structure that resembles stained glass art, where each section of the building is replaced with colored glass segments outlined by black lead. The geometry of the house appears consistent with traditional Japanese architecture. The alignment and continuity of the lines framing the panels do not show any distortions or misalignments. Based on visual cues in stained glass art, these elements are typically continuous and well-aligned, which supports the conclusion that the geometry remains intact.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the red trees on both sides of the house been converted into symmetrical floral motifs made of red and green glass segments that maintain their original placement and scale without unnatural stretching or fragmentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree-like elements around the house are replaced by stained glass floral motifs. These motifs are made with red and green glass segments, commonly used color schemes in stained glass art. The floral designs are symmetrical and correspond to the relative placement of the original trees, as there is a balance in the composition on either side of the house. There is no indication of unnatural stretching or fragmentation of these elements, as they fit the stained glass style seamlessly within the overall composition.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the red moon represented as a series of concentric gradient circles in stained glass style, with smooth color transitions and no jagged edges or irregularities in its form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of the moon in Image B employs a series of concentric circles with gradient color transitions, typical of stained glass artwork. The circular form is smooth, without jagged edges or irregularities, creating a harmonious visual element consistent with the stained glass style. Such smooth transitions are fundamental in high-quality stained glass art, ensuring aesthetic consistency and integrity of form.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all structural and decorative lines—such as those framing glass panels, outlining windows, and defining floral motifs—uniform, continuous, and properly aligned without breaks, overlaps, or uneven thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lines outlining the glass panels and motifs are uniform and depict the characteristics of a quality stained glass piece. The lines are continuous, properly aligned, and have a consistent thickness throughout, which is typical for stained glass craftsmanship to maintain precision and structural integrity. There are no visible breaks, overlaps, or uneven thicknesses that would suggest a lack of alignment or continuity in the artwork.",

      "question": "Do the reflections in the water accurately mirror the stained glass version of the house, red floral trees, and red moon with correct proportions, alignment, and color fidelity, without distortion or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the reflection in the water accurately mirrors the stained glass visuals of the scene above. The reflection maintains correct proportions and alignment, replicating the colors and placement of the house, floral motifs, and moon. These reflections are portrayed with color fidelity typical of optical reflections in art, and there is no evident distortion or blurring, showcasing an artistically accurate rendering.",
