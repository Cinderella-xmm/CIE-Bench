      "question": "Does the transformed hairstyle retain a consistent volumetric structure without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in the cotton candy swirls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hairstyle is depicted in a cartoonish or stylized manner, resembling cotton candy with voluminous swirls. The visual appearance suggests a smooth and continuous structure without visible irregularities, which is consistent with the depiction of such a style as fluffy and rounded. The absence of jagged edges or unnatural breaks supports a seamless design, typical in this style of illustration.",

      "question": "Is the suit’s surface uniformly glossy without areas of over-saturation or unnatural reflection that disrupt the 3D paper doll illusion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the suit is presented with a stylized, flat design typical of 2D illustrations, which emphasizes clean lines and uniform coloration instead of realistic texture. The suit lacks glossiness or reflection, reflecting a consistent color application without over-saturation, thereby maintaining the flat, graphic quality expected in a 2D paper doll motif.",

      "question": "Is the oversized tie proportionally aligned with the collar and neck area without distorting the jawline or shirt collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tie is drawn in a bold, exaggerated cartoon style that remains proportionally consistent with the shirt collar and neck. The tie is placed in a central position, correctly aligned with the opening of the collar, avoiding any misalignment or distortion that would affect the collar's symmetry or the shirt's overall aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pastel pink and blue hues smoothly blended throughout the hair without visible color banding or hard edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hairstyle in Image B features soft pastel hues of pink and blue, which are smoothly blended to create a seamless gradient effect typical of stylized illustrations. This smooth blending technique eliminates any visible divisions or hard edges between colors, achieving an effect akin to airbrushing, essential in producing a cohesive color transition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the geometric patterns on the suit align with the garment’s seams and contours without overlapping or breaking at critical structural points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of the suit in Image B adheres to the contours and structure expected in stylized artwork. While the geometric patterns are not overtly visible, the uniform color and clean lines imply that any detailing would follow the garment’s contours without unnecessary overlap or interruption, maintaining the integrity of the depicted suit's structure.",
