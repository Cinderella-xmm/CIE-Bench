    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the transformed towers retain the original stone texture and structural lines, and are they shaped into arms without geometric distortion or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the towers of the Brooklyn Bridge are transformed into the arms of a golem. The stone texture is consistent with the original infrastructure, preserving the brick-like appearance and linear structural lines, which suggests careful attention to detail in maintaining the original aesthetic. The arms are robustly shaped without noticeable geometric distortions or breaks, which implies a transformation that respects the original form while adapting it to a new function.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the suspension cables rendered as continuous, sinewy tendons with consistent metallic texture and natural curvature around the chest area, without fraying or abrupt changes in thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suspension cables of the bridge have been transformed into tendons that cross the chest of the stone golem. These tendons maintain a consistent metallic texture, closely resembling the strength and continuity of bridge cables. The curvature around the chest is smooth and even, suggesting that the transition to the golem's anatomy was handled with a focus on naturalism. There are no evident frayed ends or abrupt changes in thickness, indicating a seamless adaptation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the Freedom Tower transformed into a crown with clear, faceted crystal surfaces that reflect light naturally and are positioned directly above the golem’s head without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the Freedom Tower has been imaginatively transformed into a crown atop the golem's head. The crown features clear, faceted crystal surfaces that display realistic light reflections, enhancing the visual continuity of the structure as a crown. It is aligned directly with the golem's head, neither floating nor misaligned, indicating careful attention to positioning within the overall composition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers seamlessly integrated into the golem’s body as armor plating, with no visible gaps, overlaps, or misaligned building edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays skyscrapers integrated into the golem's body, serving as elements of armor plating. The skyscrapers are meticulously placed along the surface, maintaining alignment and avoiding gaps or overlaps. Edges appear intentional and well-fitted to the golem's overall shape, demonstrating a thoughtful approach to integrating urban architecture into a fantastical form without visible mismatches.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the golem’s base fully anchored to the ground and water, with no floating or disconnected limbs, and does its overall scale match the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golem stands with its base appearing solidly anchored to the ground and water level, with all limbs connected robustly to the central structure. There is a coherent scale relationship between the golem and the surrounding urban environment, as its size is significant but consistent with the monumental image of a golem that could plausibly exist within a cityscape setting. This suggests attention to scale and environmental integration.",
