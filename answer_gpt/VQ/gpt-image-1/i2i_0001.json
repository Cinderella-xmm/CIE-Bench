      "question": "Does the keychain appear to be naturally integrated into the scene without any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in Image B is held in a human hand and appears to be made of soft rubber with thick black outlines, typical for chibi-style merchandise. The focus is sharp, with no visible artifacts that might suggest poor editing or unnatural textures. The keychain visually fits well within the setting of a human hand, without odd shadows or mismatched lighting that would stand out as artificial.",

      "question": "Are the keychain's features consistent with the chibi-style representation of the subject, preserving structural coherence and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi style is known for exaggerated small and cute proportions, such as large eyes and a simplified body. The keychain in Image B follows this style: the eyes are large, the facial features are simplified, and the form is coherent with common depictions of chibi-style art. This preserves the character's core recognizable traits while adhering to the unique artistic style.",

      "question": "Does the keychain maintain essential details that make the subject recognizable, avoiding distortions such as broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain retains key recognizable elements such as the blue and yellow headscarf and a visible pearl earring, which are iconic features of the artwork it represents. These details make the keychain identifiable as a chibi representation of the famous subject, without any apparent distortions or broken shapes diminishing recognition.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the materials of the keychain, specifically the soft rubber texture and bold black outlines, accurately represented without introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture of the keychain suggests a soft rubber material, often used for chibi keychains, with smooth surfaces and bold black outlines. This is visually consistent with what one would expect from a keychain of this nature, without any textures that would feel out of place or unnatural for the material.",

      "question": "Does the small silver keyring attached to the keychain appear proportionally correct and physically plausible, contributing to the overall visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silver keyring attached to the keychain is proportionally small, fitting the design and size of the keychain without appearing oversized or disproportionately small. It aligns well with typical keychain designs, where the ring's size allows practical attachment to keys or bags, thus adding to the realism and plausibility of the object.",
