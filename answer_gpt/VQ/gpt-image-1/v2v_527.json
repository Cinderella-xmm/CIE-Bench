      "question": "Does the LEGO representation of the dog maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO representation of the dog sits on a stop sign inside a glass cube. The LEGO style adheres to its traditional standard, which involves using interlocking bricks that create a structured, blocky form. The dog’s form is consistent with LEGO designs, featuring smooth brick transitions and appropriate coloration without introducing distortions or artifacts. Thus, its structural integrity is maintained.",

      "question": "Does the gradient shading used for the sky and clouds preserve their natural appearance and depth without introducing any unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is depicted with a light blue gradient that transitions smoothly, and the clouds are simple white shapes set against this gradient background. The shading appears consistent with a simplistic and minimalistic style, without any jagged edges or pixelation, which suggests depth appropriately within the chosen artistic style. Therefore, the shading maintains a natural appearance without artifacts.",

      "question": "Does the LEGO-style stop sign retain its proper proportions and physical rationality, avoiding any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a stop sign made up of neatly arranged LEGO bricks. It retains the octagonal shape with clear geometric borders typical of a stop sign, maintaining uniformity and consistency without visible distortions or misaligned bricks. This adherence to LEGO’s geometric precision ensures that the stop sign retains its proper proportions and physical rationality.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the base and nameplate free of unnatural textures and artifacts, maintaining a natural appearance and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base and nameplate are depicted as solid structures with smooth and coherent surfaces. The base is a simple rectangular form, while the nameplate displays clear typography without texture anomalies or graphical distortions. These components maintain their visual integrity and credibility effectively.",

      "question": "Does the transparent glass cube enclosure preserve its authenticity and natural appearance, without introducing any visual distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass cube enclosure features transparent sides with reflections typical of glass material. The lines on the cube appear straight and the reflection adds depth. Its transparency is clear and consistent with real glass without introducing distortions or misplaced reflections. The structure maintains its natural appearance and authenticity.",
