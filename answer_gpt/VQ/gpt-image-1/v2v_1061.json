      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the badge maintain the same level of detail and texture as the vibrant domes and intricate patterns of the building, avoiding unnatural textures or loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge features an illustration of the building's vibrant and intricate design. Being in a cartoonish style, it intentionally reduces the level of detail and mimics the buildingâ€™s features by simplifying the shapes and patterns, which naturally results in a loss of fine detail as compared to the original structure in Image A. Therefore, the badge does not maintain the same level of detail and texture as the building itself.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes and proportions of the badge consistent with the architectural style of the building, ensuring no distortion or breakage of shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge depicts the architectural style of the building using simplified and exaggerated geometric shapes typical of cartoon illustrations. While the proportions are largely consistent with the original structure, the stylization causes slight distortions typical of artistic interpretations. Therefore, while artistic liberties are taken, the primary geometric essence remains represented.",

      "question": "Does the tassel material of the badge appear soft and flexible, and does the circular form look natural and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tassel is drawn as part of the illustration, with emphasis on cartoon-like texture and outline. The tassel appears soft and flexible, taking natural curves representative of real tassels. The circular form of the badge is clearly distinct and well-balanced, avoiding distortion. This suggests that both the tassel and circular badge maintain a natural appearance within their illustrated context.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the hand presenting the badge have a natural appearance, with no more than five fingers, and do the lines and shapes conform to ergonomics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand is illustrated with simplified cartoonish elements, but it presents a standard outline with five fingers as seen in natural human hands. The drawing respects basic ergonomic principles, depicting a natural grasp appropriate for holding a badge, thereby maintaining a coherent and natural presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement of the badge integrate seamlessly into the image, maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility without introducing any artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the badge held in a hand seamlessly as a cartoon illustration where all elements are coherently integrated into the stylistic presentation. There's a consistent design language and composition that adheres to cartoon illustration without introducing any artifacts that disrupt the integrative appearance of the badge within the hand. Therefore, it maintains visual plausibility.",
