      "question": "Does the 3D character's face retain the original facial details and proportions without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face of the 3D character is blurred, preventing a clear view of the facial details and proportions. Given this face blurring, we cannot assess the presence or absence of unnatural distortions or artifacts in facial details accurately. Given the design nature and stylized character, typical facial features and proportions are often altered to fit the aesthetic without being considered distorted. The blurring does not contribute to perceiving distortion in this context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the chibi-like long-legged proportions of the 3D character visually plausible and structurally coherent, avoiding unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi characters often have exaggerated proportions, such as oversized heads and elongated limbs, common within the artistic style that maintain visual plausibility without looking structurally coherent. Image B's character follows this style consistently, with elongated limbs and slightly disproportionate features that fit into the chibi design and appear structurally coherent despite the intentional style exaggeration.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the outfit and accessories of the 3D character incorporate the green and burnt orange hues naturally, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a coherent color scheme with burnt orange and green hues across the outfit, accessories, and background. The textures and details are preserved well in the 3D rendering, despite the stylized design. The natural integration of these hues reflects the original image's scheme without introducing unnatural textures, meeting chibi aesthetic standards.",

      "question": "Are the fashion-forward accessories like glasses, a tablet or sketchbook, and footwear integrated seamlessly into the 3D character, maintaining overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows accessories such as glasses, a tablet, and footwear that are consistent with the character's style and color scheme. These elements are integral to the chibi character design, naturally complementing and fitting within the overall aesthetic, maintaining authenticity without seeming out of place or unnatural.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the solid background color complement and highlight the 3D character's overall color scheme without introducing any distracting artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a solid color that complements the character's color palette, allowing the character to stand out without introducing distractions. This harmonious background enhances the visual appeal by reinforcing the character's colors, demonstrating thoughtfulness in design for color coherence.",
