    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the snow-capped peak exhibit a consistent, non-uniform glittering texture that mimics natural snow while avoiding blocky or artificial sparkles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow-capped peak is encased inside a glass dome illustrating a miniature landscape. The glittering effect on the snow conveys a natural look through its varied texture, resembling real snow rather than presenting blocky or unrealistic sparkles. This is inferred through understanding of common miniature crafting techniques which aim to replicate natural textures faithfully.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree lines and grasslands along the base of the mountain rendered with natural variation in color and density, without repeating brush-like strokes or artificial line artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree lines and grasslands in Image B are made to look like natural landscapes inside the dome. They show varying shades of green and appear densely packed with no repetitive brush-like strokes, giving them a realistic look. This can be deduced from the fact that miniature landscapes attempt to mimic the complex natural world, avoiding simplistic and repetitive patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lake surface uniformly reflective with no visible distortion, warping, or artificial shine that breaks the continuity of the mountain's reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lake in Image B underneath the miniature mountain reflects the scenery smoothly and uniformly, providing a consistent mirrored image of the landscape. The reflection does not appear warped or distorted, indicating quality craftsmanship aimed at portraying realistic water effects in miniature art.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the chalet figurines positioned at ground level along the shoreline with proper scale and shadow alignment, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chalet figurines in Image B are arranged clearly at ground level along the shoreline, with scale consistent relative to each other and the overall landscape. The lighting within the glass enclosure casts subtle shadows underneath the chalets, aligned with the overarching light direction, suggesting meticulous attention to detail as is often found in quality miniature art.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, distortions, or artificial reflections around the perimeter of the scene that suggest an unnatural glass boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perimeter of the glass dome enclosing the miniature scene does not exhibit visible seams or distortions. The reflections seen within the dome maintain continuity and do not break the realism of the miniature scene, indicating that the glass boundary is smooth and carefully crafted to minimize artificial reflections.",
