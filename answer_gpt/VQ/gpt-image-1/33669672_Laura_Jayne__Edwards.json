    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the limbs proportionally elongated without visible kinks, unnatural bends, or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs have a smooth, elongated appearance typical of artistic sculptures. There are no visible kinks or unnatural bends, and segments appear connected logically, reflecting artistic stylization. This suggests an intentional elongation for aesthetic effect but retains proportional coherence.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the boots and leg areas uniformly applied with clean edges and no overlapping or fragmented sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the geometric patterns with precision; edges are clearly defined and consistent, and patterns do not overlap or appear fragmented. This uniform application indicates skilled craftsmanship typical of stylized designs in art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all body parts, including the skin, dress, and boots, display a consistent metallic sheen with smooth gradients and no patches of mismatched material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic finish is applied uniformly across all surfaces, including skin, dress, and boots. The gradients are smooth, with no indication of material mismatch, maintaining a cohesive aesthetic typical of bronze sculptures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the color palette limited to metallic tones and turquoise, with no unexpected color bleed or desaturation in the figure or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B strictly adheres to metallic tones and turquoise without anomalies in color bleed or desaturation. Both the figure and the background maintain consistent hues, demonstrating control over color application.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the figure's pose maintain natural weight distribution and joint angles, with no floating limbs or unnatural overlaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B articulates a pose where the weight distribution and joint angles appear natural, characteristic of sculptures aiming to simulate realistic movement. There are no floating limbs or overlaps that would detract from a natural stance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the extended hand have exactly five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, without extra digits or fused joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the extended hand with five distinctly separated fingers with appropriate spacing and curvature, avoiding any depiction of extra digits or fused joints. This attention to detail is standard in artistic renditions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
