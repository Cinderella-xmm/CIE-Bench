      "question": "Does the snow on the clock tower appear naturally accumulated without disrupting the structural integrity of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow is depicted as accumulating on the roof and ledges of the tower, following a common snow pattern observed during winter. The typical curves and drifts present are consistent with natural snow accumulation. The snow does not seem to compromise or obscure the fundamental architectural elements such as the clock face or the structure's lines, suggesting no disruption to the tower's integrity.",

      "question": "Are the icy patterns on the flags visually credible and detailed, without introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flags have snowflake designs which are crisp and well-defined. The use of subtle, delicate lines to depict the snowflake patterns appears realistic as they mimic typical snowflakes seen in nature. The flags' textures remain consistent with what icy or snowy flags might look like, thus maintaining natural believability without introducing any unnatural textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the clock tower retain their natural appearance despite the added snow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower's material below the snow remains visible and consistent with the expectation of painted or finished surfaces usually found on clock towers. The snow overlay appears naturally placed, rather than altering or disrupting the texture of the surfaces underneath. The green and grayish colors of the tower, visible through the snow, retain their natural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the clock face and tower preserved without distortion or damage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face retains its circular shape with clearly legible Roman numerals, and the tower maintains its octagonal structure. These geometric shapes do not suffer any distortion or visual impairment, even with the snow cover, indicating preservation of the original shapes without any damage.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the clock tower and flags been preserved without any loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details such as the balustrade, shutters, and clock numerals remain clear and intact. The snow cover is carefully applied around these details, maintaining their visibility and accuracy. Similarly, the snowflake details on the flags are crisp and intricate, showing no loss in quality or introduction of unnatural elements.",
