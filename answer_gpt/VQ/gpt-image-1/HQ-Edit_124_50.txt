    "Question": "Q1: Are the puzzle sections on the horseâ€™s body clearly defined with clean, interlocking edges that follow the natural curves of the horse's form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is composed of distinct puzzle segments with well-defined, clean edges. These edges follow the natural contours of the horse, suggesting an intentional design to fit the horse's form. This observation is informed by the presence of visible seams indicating puzzle pieces, which traditionally fit together in a precise manner.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the floral patterns on each puzzle section align seamlessly at the edges where pieces meet, maintaining visual continuity?",
    "explanation": "The floral patterns on Image B's horse appear to align well across the puzzle pieces, creating a cohesive design. The seamless continuity suggests careful attention to pattern placement on each puzzle segment, which maintains visual flow despite being separate pieces. This is aided by the fact that mismatched patterns would disrupt the aesthetic appeal of a unified image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the glass dome over the horse clear and free from unnatural distortions, smudges, or irregular reflections that would suggest poor material simulation?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears clear and transparent without visible smudges or distortions. The reflections behave naturally, suggesting a well-rendered material that simulates real glass accurately. This observation is based on typical characteristics of a high-quality glass dome which is expected to be transparent and devoid of visual artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the wooden base exhibit realistic wood grain and texture, and is the compass embedded in a way that matches the surface plane and scale of the base?",
    "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B shows detailed wood grain and texture, contributing to a realistic appearance. The compass appears embedded precisely at the surface plane, aligning with the base's scale, which indicates careful design and attention to detail. These observations stem from the expectation of high-quality woodworking where grain and inlay details reflect craftsmanship.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the antique-brass accents positioned logically on the frame and base, with a matte-to-slight-reflective finish consistent with aged metal?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the antique-brass accents on the frame and base exhibit a finish that transitions from matte to slightly reflective, typical of aged metal surfaces. Their positioning seems intentional, designed to complement the overall aesthetic. This impression is drawn from knowledge of brass characteristics, which often show wear and patina consistent with age and use.",
    "answer": "Yes"
