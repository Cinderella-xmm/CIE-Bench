      "question": "Are the swirling ocean wave patterns inside the crystal bottle smooth, continuous, and free of jagged edges or unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the swirling ocean wave patterns inside the crystal bottle are represented with artistic quality, displaying continuous, flowing lines that mimic natural wave movements. The patterns appear fluid and smooth, without any jagged edges or signs of distortion. This suggests that they have been artistically rendered to enhance the bottle's aesthetic without disruption in continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the golden maritime symbols on the bottle label occupy the correct area, maintain sharp edges, and show no signs of pixelation or smudging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden maritime symbols on the bottle label stand out clearly with sharp edges. The golden hue is consistent and the symbols are precisely positioned within the intended design area on the bottle. There is no visible pixelation or smudging on the symbols, indicating high-quality rendering suitable for a polished design aesthetic.",

      "question": "Does the compass rose at the top of the packaging have evenly spaced metallic points with realistic reflections and no misalignment or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Focusing on the compass rose at the top of the packaging in Image B, the design shows evenly spaced points forming a symmetrical pattern. The points are rendered with attention to detail, and there are no visible signs of misalignment or clipping artifacts. The design is consistent with how a compass rose is typically depicted, contributing to an overall impression of precision.",

      "question": "Is the transition from the bottle neck to the wave-patterned body seamless, with no abrupt breaks or geometric deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition from the bottle neck to the wave-patterned body appears seamless. There is a smooth flow between the continuous wave pattern and the crystal clarity of the bottle neck. The design does not exhibit any abrupt breaks or geometric distortions, suggesting careful consideration in the design process to maintain visual harmony.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the parchment surface of the packaging display consistent aging texture without artificial streaks or uneven shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parchment surface of the packaging in Image B shows a consistent aging texture. The use of color and shading replicates the appearance of aged parchment, avoiding artificial streaks or uneven shading that could disrupt the authentic look. The design manages to convey an antiquated, rustic feel that aligns with the thematic elements of the packaging.",
