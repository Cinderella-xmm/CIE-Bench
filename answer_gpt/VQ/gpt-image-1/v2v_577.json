      "question": "Does the LEGO-style minifigure maintain the subject's calm and professional demeanor without any unnatural distortions in its facial features or posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the minifigure is modeled in a classic LEGO style, which inherently simplifies details while preserving an impression of the original subject. World knowledge of LEGO figures tells us that their facial expressions are often simplistic and neutral, aligning with a calm demeanor. The posture is precise, with arms positioned at the laptop, suggesting a professional setting. LEGO figures are known for consistent proportions and structured poses, eliminating chances of distortion, thus conveying a calm and professional demeanor without any unnatural distortions.",
