      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed dress exhibit smooth, flowing fabric folds consistent with celestial robes, without visible pixelation, unnatural sheen, or disrupted geometric patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the dress presents an intricate design with smooth and flowing folds. The fabric emulates the characteristics typical of celestial robes, where the patterns have both harmony and elegance, with no signs of pixelation or unnatural sheen that would disrupt its geometric integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gold and silver filigree details aligned with the fabricâ€™s surface and lighting direction, showing no floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The filigree details in Image B are visually consistent with the fabric's contours and follow the lighting direction accurately. These details appear organically integrated into the dress, with no visible misalignment or edge floating, thus preserving the intended aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the clouds beneath the figure have volumetric form and gradient shading that match the perspective and scale of the scene, avoiding flat or cartoonish rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds beneath the figure exhibit a volumetric quality with gradient shading that enhances depth perception. They are consistent with the scene's perspective and scale, avoiding any flat or overly simplistic artistic rendering.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a sky where the transition between night and dawn hues near the horizon is smooth and gradual. The illumination remains consistent throughout, without abrupt changes in color or any obvious errors in star placement.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands present five fingers, each with natural proportions and realistic skin texture. The glowing wisps emanate from the palms and do not interfere with or distort the structure of the hands.",
