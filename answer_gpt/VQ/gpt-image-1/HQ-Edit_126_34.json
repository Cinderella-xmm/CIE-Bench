      "question": "Are the edges of the cabinâ€™s roof, walls, and windows clearly defined and geometrically consistent, even with visible brushstrokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin's roof, walls, and windows are depicted with impressionistic brushstrokes, which inherently leads to a softer, less defined outline. The geometric consistency is interpreted through the overall form and shape maintained by the cabin, yet the brushstrokes create a more abstract representation. Such impressionistic techniques focus more on artistic effect rather than precise geometry, implying a degree of distortion or abstraction. Thus, the edges are not clearly defined and lack strict geometric consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surrounding fir trees maintain their vertical orientation and layered foliage structure despite the use of loose brushwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fir trees are painted with loose, impressionistic brushstrokes, giving them an abstract form. However, despite the stylistic approach, the general vertical orientation and the suggestion of layered foliage can be discerned. The technique implies trees without precision, yet the essential forms are maintained enough to recognize their upright nature and layers, suggesting continuity of structure even with artistic abstraction.",

      "question": "Does the smoke rise straight upward from the chimney and gradually blur outward, mimicking natural dispersion in cold air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smoke from the chimney appears to rise upwards, painted with a blend of colors that suggests gradual outward dispersion. The artistic style focuses on capturing the essence of smoke dispersal rather than a literal depiction, yet manages to convey the manner in which smoke would behave in cold air, where it tends to rise and slowly disperse.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the snow covering the roof, ground, and tree branches uniformly distributed and textured in a way that suggests natural accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow is painted with varied color tones and loose brushstrokes, implying texture and depth. Although the technique is non-literal, it does suggest a natural accumulation pattern typical of snow, given the spread across the roof, ground, and tree branches. The variation in colors aids in portraying a sense of natural texture and gradual distribution.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the illuminated windows and string lights along the eaves softly blended into the scene, without harsh outlines or glowing halos that break the stylistic consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows and string lights are painted with warm colors that softly blend into the surrounding environment. The use of light reflects an impressionistic style that eschews harsh outlines or unnatural halos, opting instead for a harmonious integration with the overall scene. This maintains the stylistic consistency inherent to the impressionistic approach.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the foreground elements (small trees, fence) appear closer than the midground cabin and background trees, preserving depth and spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial arrangement suggested by the brushwork implies that the foreground elements like small trees and a fence are closer to the viewer than the cabin, which is depicted in the midground. The background trees are further back, maintaining spatial depth. This arrangement is consistent with traditional landscape depictions, where varying scales and focus hint at different spatial layers.",
