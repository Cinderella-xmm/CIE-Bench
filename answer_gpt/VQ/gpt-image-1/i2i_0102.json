      "question": "Does the handwritten word \"Draft\" on the yellow paper appear seamlessly integrated without unnatural textures or color discrepancies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handwritten word 'Draft' is placed on the yellow paper. The integration appears smooth as there are no noticeable color discrepancies between the word and the paper nor any unnatural textures that would indicate artificial layering. The color of the text is consistent throughout and fits well with the scene's lighting conditions, supporting seamless integration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the style and material of the handwritten word \"Draft\" visually consistent with the pencil used in the image and typical design sketches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handwritten word 'Draft' is written in a cursive, stylized font that appears plausible for a design sketch, which typically uses pencils for preliminary designs and noting drafts. The color of the text matches that of a pencil line, enhancing the coherence between the pencil and the text. The style is consistent with what might typically be seen in a design context done with a pencil.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the addition of the handwritten word \"Draft\" preserved the structural integrity of the yellow paper, avoiding any distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "After placing the word 'Draft', the yellow paper in Image B maintains its shape and alignment with the table and surrounding objects. There is no indication of warping or misalignment when compared to the background. The paper remains flat and aligned as it was intended without any repercussions from the added text.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the handwritten word \"Draft\" sharp and clear, without introducing any unnatural blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of the handwritten word 'Draft' in Image B are clean and precise, showing no signs of blurring or pixelation. The text maintains a high level of sharpness typical for vector or well-rendered digital text, suggesting that it is well-integrated without noticeable artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the pencil on the yellow paper remain physically logical and visually credible after adding the handwritten word \"Draft\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pencil is shown hovering over the yellow paper, poised to write. Its placement remains coherent with the image's added word, suggesting it is the tool used for writing, thus maintaining a logical visual narrative. The positioning does not appear altered or inconsistent with the task of writing 'Draft' onto the paper.",
