      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the line-art transformation of the person's pose retain the natural positioning of the raised hand, open mouth, and camera without introducing unnatural textures or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the line-art transformation of the second image, the pose, including the raised hand, open mouth, and camera, is simplified into clear outlines typical of cartoon styles. The hand's gesture with spread fingers, the open-mouth expression indicating speech or excitement, and the depiction of the camera are all represented in a stylized manner. There is no indication of distortion or unnatural textures as the transformation aims for a simplified, cartoonish style rather than realistic detailing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the raised hand, open mouth, and camera covering part of the face preserved in a way that maintains their structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The line-art image preserves the key features of the raised hand, open mouth, and camera in a manner consistent with cartoon illustrations. The hand remains anatomically correct as per cartoon standards, the mouth is depicted open with an exaggerated smile, and the camera is clearly identifiable as a typical compact camera shape. The visual credibility is maintained as the simplification is typical for cartoon style and does not contradict the structural elements of these parts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the added speech bubble with the text “Take a photo” integrate naturally into the image without introducing any obvious artifacts or disrupting the scene's realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble with 'Take a photo' text is a common feature of cartoon and comic styles where dialogue or text elements interact with the scene. Despite being an addition, it is consistent with the illustration norms, meaning it integrates naturally without conflicting with the line-art style. It serves to enhance the illustrative understanding of the scene rather than providing photographic realism, which aligns with the aim of converting to a cartoon form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details, such as the texture of the bathroom and the person’s clothing, been preserved without loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The line-art transformation eliminates textural details in favor of outlines common to cartoon illustrations. Therefore, the preservation of fine details like bathroom texture and clothing patterns is not required in this context. Instead, the focus shifts to capturing the essential outlines and forms. There is no loss in quality relevant to this style, as the transformation intention is not to replicate photographic textures but to convey the same scene through simplified line work.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cartoon line-art transformation maintain the realistic proportions and shapes of the person and objects, avoiding any distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The line-art keeps to the proportions typical in cartoon portrayals. The person and objects, like the hand, face, and camera, retain recognizable and proportionate geometry that is consistent with cartoon drawing conventions. The use of exaggerated proportions slightly (like enlarged hands or facial features) is a stylistic choice common in cartoons, hence not considered a distortion in this context.",
