    "Question": "Q1: Does the cat maintain natural proportions and anatomical structure without visible stretching, compression, or deformation in the shadow box scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted with a relaxed posture, sitting on a throne-like chair, which is consistent with a natural lounging position commonly seen in cats. The depiction of the cat's anatomy—such as the curvature of its body, placement of paws, and overall proportion—appears accurate and consistent with a real cat's anatomy. There are no visible signs of distortion like stretching or compression, indicating that the proportions are well-maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the materials of the settee (velvet and wood) rendered with realistic textures and consistent lighting, showing no signs of pixelation, mismatched shading, or artificial seams?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus should be on the materials depicted in the shadow box scene. Here, the velvet texture of the chair appears to have soft highlights consistent with lighting that reveals its plush surface. The wooden elements, including the chair's frame, are shown with detailed grain and reflective surfaces, providing convincing wood textures. The absence of any pixelation, mismatched shading, or artificial seams confirms that the materials are rendered believably.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the velvet curtains appear physically plausible with correct fold patterns, soft shadows, and seamless integration into the background without floating or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, we observe that the velvet curtains are depicted with realistic fold patterns typical of heavy fabric, with subtle lighting changes enhancing their dimensionality. The shadows cast by the folds appear consistent and soft, which contribute to a natural appearance. Furthermore, the curtains are integrated seamlessly with the surrounding frame and environment; there are no misaligned or floating edges present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the gilded columns properly scaled, positioned with correct perspective, and rendered with reflective metallic surfaces that match the ambient light without artifacts like blurring or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "In the shadow box scene of Image B, the gilded columns are shown with detailed metallic finishes that reflect light appropriately, matching the ambient lighting. Their scale and positioning are consistent within the context of the small frame, providing a balanced and proportionate look. The columns appear sharp without blurring or jagged edges, suggesting accurate rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the hanging mouse portraits clearly visible, correctly sized relative to the scene, and mounted with realistic shadows and string attachments without visual glitches or texture errors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse portraits flanking the central throne are clearly visible and proportionate, adding to the scene's narrative. They are appropriately sized within the spatial constraints and cast realistic shadows that denote depth. The attachment method appears plausible without visible strings but with shadows that imply secure mounting. The portraits do not exhibit any texture errors or visual glitches, ensuring their clarity in the composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
