    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the surface of the figurine exhibit a uniform glossy finish consistent with ceramic material, without patches of retained knit texture or uneven sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show a smooth and glossy surface on the figurine, characteristic of ceramic material. This glossy finish does not show any patches of knit texture, which would suggest uneven application. Such a uniform sheen is typical of well-finished ceramic items, which are often polished to a consistent luster.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the terracotta color applied uniformly across the entire body of the figurine, without streaks, discoloration, or mismatched tones in different areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the terracotta color appears to be evenly applied across the surface of the figurine. The consistent color tone without noticeable streaks or discoloration indicates a uniform application, typical of well-crafted ceramic items where paint is evenly distributed.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the floral engravings clearly defined, proportionally scaled, and seamlessly embedded into the surface of the figurine without causing geometric distortions or overlapping inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral engravings on the surface of the figurine in Image B are depicted as clear and proportionally scaled. They appear seamlessly embedded without any noticeable geometric distortions or inconsistencies such as overlapping lines, which indicates careful craftsmanship. Engravings are typically well-defined to enhance the aesthetic appeal of ceramic art.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the amber-colored eyes have a smooth, polished appearance with appropriate reflection and depth, and are they correctly positioned within the facial structure without appearing displaced or oversized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The question mentions features that are not visible in Image B, which focuses primarily on the body and surface design. Since the relevant part of the image is blurred and eyes are not visible, it is not possible to assess this detail properly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figurine resting flat on a wooden surface with visible wood grain and natural shadowing beneath it, indicating proper physical support and spatial coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine appears to be resting on a wooden surface, as evidenced by the visible wood grain beneath it. The natural shadowing also suggests that the figurine is supported correctly, portraying spatial coherence, which aligns with realistic physics where objects cast shadows relative to a surface.",
