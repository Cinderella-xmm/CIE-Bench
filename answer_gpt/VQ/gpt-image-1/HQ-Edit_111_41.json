      "question": "Are the seat cushion's surfaces composed of clearly defined, uniformly sized LEGO brick layers with smooth gradients between them, maintaining a consistent black color without texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seat cushion surfaces are designed as LEGO bricks. LEGO bricks are known for their distinct, uniformly sized appearance with smooth gradients between each block, typically maintaining consistent color and texture. The black color in the image remains consistent without visible texture artifacts, confirming the use of LEGO elements, which are designed to have uniformity and smooth finishes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the backrest consist of evenly spaced, horizontally aligned LEGO brick layers that follow the original contour without gaps, misalignments, or irregular spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backrest in Image B is constructed with LEGO bricks that are characteristic for their uniform size and have a pattern of evenly spaced horizontal layers. These layers maintain the backrest's contour consistently and display neither gaps nor misalignment, which is typical of how LEGO pieces are designed to seamlessly fit together, ensuring an orderly appearance.",

      "question": "Are the armrests rendered as simple hinged LEGO pieces with clean edges and uniform silver finish, preserving their original curvature and connection points without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armrests in Image B are depicted as LEGO pieces, characterized by clean, precise edges and a consistent silver finish typical of LEGO's manufacturing quality. These pieces maintain the original shape and functional curvature needed for armrests, with clear connection points that are free of distortion. The use of LEGO elements ensures that their construction is consistent and uniform.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all five wheels made of translucent gray material with visible internal structure resembling LEGO wheel design, and do they maintain consistent size and placement under the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels are represented in a gray material typical of LEGO wheels, which often have a translucent appearance and distinct internal structures. All wheels are consistent in size and are evenly placed under the chair, reflecting the typical design and uniformity associated with LEGO wheel components.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the chair positioned on a flat, uninterrupted white tabletop surface that contrasts with the original floor, with no visible shadows or depth inconsistencies suggesting misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair is depicted as being on a smooth, white tabletop surface which contrasts clearly with the original flooring seen in Image A. The surface is uninterrupted, without any visible depth inconsistencies or misalignment that would indicate errors in positioning or rendering shadows. This type of surface is common in product photography and rendering to ensure clear contrast and focus on the product itself.",
