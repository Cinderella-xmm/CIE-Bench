      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunflowers are depicted with smooth, flowing patterns characteristic of Art Nouveau style, where curves are emphasized over sharp angles or jagged edges.

      "question": "Does the dress display smooth, flowing patterns that follow the contours of the body without abrupt angles or unnatural fabric tension?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress follows the flowing contours typical of Art Nouveau design, with smooth lines and curves. There are no abrupt angles or signs of unnatural fabric tension visible, as the design flows naturally along the body's shape, consistent with the style's emphasis on organic harmony.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the Art Nouveau patterns in the hair, dress, and background unified in line style, color palette, and scale, creating a cohesive visual composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a unified visual style across hair, dress, and background that follows the Art Nouveau aesthetic. The line style is consistent, with flowing curves and swirls. The color palette is uniformly applied, using earthy tones, and the scale of design elements is balanced across the composition, reflecting a cohesive integration typical of this artistic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details in the sunflower centers, hair braids, and facial features preserved and clearly defined, without noticeable blurring or artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates an intricate and stylized design with emphasis on unified, flowing patterns rather than fine, realistic details. Thus, while the artistic style maintains clarity within its own aesthetic, it does not preserve fine details of realism, focusing more on the unity of lines and composition found in Art Nouveau than clear individual elements.",
