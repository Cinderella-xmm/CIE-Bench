    "Question": "Q1: Are the geometric patterns on the dress preserved as continuous, non-distorted shapes without broken edges or misaligned tiles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dress features geometric patterns formed by distinct, colored tiles, giving a mosaic effect. Each tile retains its form without any reported breaks or misalignment. This contributes to the visual integrity of the pattern. By using tiles, the mosaic emphasizes the continuous, structured nature of the design, suggesting no distortion is present in the patterned dress.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the necklaces appear as flat, transparent stained glass tiles with consistent color gradients and no jagged or pixelated edges?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays the necklaces with a mosaic-like effect, emphasizing individual segments with varied color tones, akin to stained glass tiles. Each necklace piece is well-defined and uniform, without jagged or uneven pixelation. The transition between colors is smooth, maintaining a consistent gradient and avoiding visual abnormalities.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the individual braids still distinguishable and proportionally accurate, with smooth transitions between segments and no collapsed or fused strands?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the braids are depicted with a distinct mosaic style, ensuring each braid and their respective segments remain visually separate. This techniques enhance clarity, preventing fused or distorted appearances. The flow and proportion of the braids are maintained, ensuring visual coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the background display varied textures and elevation changes consistent with natural terrain, without uniform patches or unnatural color blending?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is transformed into a mosaic, consisting of textured tiles. These tiles portray the variations of natural terrain through different shapes and heights, simulating a realistic landscape. The color blending remains true to natural terrains with gradual transitions, avoiding any uniform or unnatural patches.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Are the bracelets on both arms symmetrically positioned, correctly numbered, and free from distortion such as stretching or overlapping?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates the bracelets using distinct tiles in a mosaic approach. Each bracelet retains its original symmetry and alignment, with no noticeable stretching, overlapping, or distortion. The quantity remains as observed, ensuring consistency with natural form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
