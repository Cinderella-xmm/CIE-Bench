      "question": "Are the brushed metal and matte finishes applied consistently across the robot’s body without visible texture artifacts or inconsistent sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a robot in a display box, with a metallic finish that appears consistent and well-applied across its body. The surface has no visible texture artifacts, displaying a uniform sheen indicative of quality texturing. The metallic look is convincing without any visible inconsistencies or signs of poor application, suggesting proper rendering in the final image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hexagonal box in Image B appears carefully designed with clean edges and appropriate proportions that encapsulate the robot properly. The text 'MECHA VANGUARD' is legible and distinctly rendered on the box without any distortion, ensuring the product details are conveyed effectively.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the engraved details on the armor plates and weapon surfaces clear and non-blurry, and do the joint areas (elbows, knees) show no signs of geometric distortion or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The engraved details on the robot in Image B are sharp and clearly visible on both the armor plates and the weapon surfaces. The joints, specifically at the elbows and knees, maintain their geometry without any distortion or gaps, indicating precision in the detailing and modeling of the robot, which ensures a high-quality appearance and structural logic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the cityscape background extend behind the robot without clipping through its limbs or body, and does it match the lighting direction and scale of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cityscape background is positioned behind the robot, seamlessly integrating with the scene. It does not clip through any part of the robot and aligns with the lighting direction and scale, confirming a cohesive visual composition that harmonizes both foreground and background elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the robot with limbs, weapons, and armor pieces expertly aligned and positioned. There are no overlapping or floating elements, maintaining spatial logic and ensuring that each component fits accurately within the scene's context, reinforcing the realism and integrity of the design.",
