    "Question": "Q1: Do the golden horn-like spikes on the headstock align symmetrically with the neck and show no signs of clipping, distortion, or mismatched angles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cue shows a dragon's head with horn-like structures that align symmetrically above its body, similar to how a headstock aligns with the neck of a guitar. The symmetry and consistent angle demonstrate no signs of clipping or distortion. The horns match the body's structure, maintaining alignment with the neck area to create a coherent visual representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the luminescent runes clearly visible along the fretboard without bleeding into the wood or appearing as separate floating overlays?",
    "explanation": "The luminescent runes in Image B are vertically aligned along the dragon's neck (analogous to a fretboard). They are integrated into the surface without appearing as separate overlays or bleeding into the surrounding textures. This integration maintains the appearance of embedded runes rather than floating or ill-fitted designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the fiery tendrils originate from the bridge and terminate at the nut, following a continuous and uninterrupted path without gaps or floating segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fiery tendrils are depicted along the strings similar to a guitar's structure, representing continuous energy flow from the body to the dragon's head. There are no gaps in the tendrils, showing an uninterrupted pathway similar to how guitar strings run from the bridge to the nut.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the wing structures symmetrical on both sides of the body and covered in evenly spaced, realistic scale patterns without gaps or distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's wings are symmetrical and each wing showcases evenly spaced scale patterns that create a realistic texture without gaps or distortions. The symmetry ensures both wings are visually balanced and consistent across the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the body maintain the original guitar's silhouette while showing consistent dragon-like textures such as scales or ridges, with no visible seams or loss of contour detail?",
    "explanation": "Image B transforms the guitar's body into a dragon-like form while retaining a similar silhouette seen in Image A (the guitar). The transformation incorporates scales and ridges, which replace the guitar's surface textures. These dragon-like details are seamlessly integrated into the body without losing the contour and structural detail of the original item.",
    "answer": "Yes"
