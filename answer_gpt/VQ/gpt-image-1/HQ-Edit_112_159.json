      "question": "Is the glass display case surrounding the car and road clearly defined with smooth edges, proper transparency, and no floating or misaligned sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case is visually discernible with clear, smooth edges. The transparency appears consistent, allowing an unobstructed view of the objects inside without any visual distortion. The edges and corners of the case look aligned, and the display case seems to be properly enclosing the miniature setup with no floating or misaligned sections observed. This suggests the glass is carefully designed to surround the displayed items.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car’s surface exhibit consistent metallic red coloring with smooth gradient transitions and preserved sharp detail lines along the body panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car features a metallic red finish that appears even and consistent across its surface. The coloring includes smooth gradient transitions that add to the perception of a metallic texture, which is a common characteristic of high-quality paint jobs. The sharp detail lines along the car’s body panels are preserved, maintaining the vehicle's intricate design and contouring, which reflects care in texturing and shading.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the resin layers in the road and cliff areas visibly distinct with gradual transparency and depth cues, avoiding flat or uniformly colored sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the resin layers beneath the road and cliff areas show distinctiveness through layers that offer depth cues, suggesting dimension beyond a flat surface. The gradual transparency between these layers is noticeable, contributing to an impression of depth and topographical variety. This avoids a simplistic or uniformly colored appearance, instead offering a visually complex and realistic miniature representation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the micro gravel texture evenly distributed across the road and cliff surfaces, with natural variation in size and no repetitive or artificial patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road and cliff surfaces exhibit a micro gravel texture that appears to be evenly distributed, emulating the natural variance found in real landscapes. There is a noticeable variation in the size of the gravel, which adds realism and avoids any repetitive or artificial patterns that would break the illusion of a natural environment. This reflects attention to detail in texture creation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sunset sky panel blend smoothly with the original sky, maintaining consistent color gradients and horizon alignment without visible seams or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the sky panel is integrated into the display scene, merging with the sky behind the car. The color gradients of the sunset, defined by rich oranges and reds transitioning to darker hues, persist without abrupt changes, ensuring a smooth blend. The horizon line appears continuous and aligned, free from visual seams or clipping, thus maintaining a coherent sunset scene uninterrupted by panel edges.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the car, road, cliffs, and display case consistent with a miniature scale, avoiding exaggerated or unrealistic sizing relationships?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car, road, cliffs, and overall setup within the display case adhere to a believable miniature scale. The dimensions and proportions of each component appear deliberately reduced to a scale that fits logically within the confines of the display case. The relationships between the car, road, and surrounding elements remain in harmony, avoiding exaggerated dimensions that would disrupt the balance and realism of the miniature setting.",
