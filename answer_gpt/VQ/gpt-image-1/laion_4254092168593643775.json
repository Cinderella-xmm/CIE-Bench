      "question": "Does the silhouette of the rider maintain correct limb proportions and joint alignment without unnatural elongation or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the rider is a stylized representation depicted in a cartoonish form. When assessing correctness of limb proportions and joint alignment, even in this stylized form, the limbs appear to be proportionate and the alignment seems correct. This is achieved through recognizable human posture and consistent limb ratios. From a design perspective, there is no indication of unnatural elongation or compression inconsistent with typical stylized art.",

      "question": "Are the sand streaks in the background smoothly blended with the motion blur and do they follow the direction of travel without sharp, unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sand streaks are illustrated in a graphic style, reflecting motion and speed that align with the rider's direction. The streaks follow a smooth and consistent pattern without any noticeable sharp or unnatural breaks, emulating the dynamic flow typically associated with high-speed movement in such artwork.",

      "question": "Is the \"RaceFuel\" text clearly legible and positioned without obscuring key parts of the rider or motorcycle, and does it blend cohesively with the overall design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'RaceFuel' text in Image B is prominently featured and is clearly legible. It is strategically positioned in an area that does not cover essential elements of the illustration, such as the rider or motorcycle, ensuring visibility and readability. The text sizes and font choice harmonize with the rest of the design, complementing the overall aesthetic.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The track outline in Image B appears to be part of the illustrative style, positioned in the upper-right corner. The closed loop is distinctive, smoothly connected without any noticeable break or self-intersection, which indicates careful attention to continuity in design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speedometer icon in Image B is located at the bottom corner of the image. It is depicted with a clear, round dial and a needle clearly pointing to maximum speed. There is no visible distortion, ensuring it's easily recognizable and conveys the message of high speed effectively.",
