      "question": "Are the stitches on the cactusâ€™s body and sombrero clearly visible, evenly spaced, and consistent with the knitting style of the surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stitches on the cactus's body and sombrero are distinctly visible and maintain a consistent pattern that resembles a typical crocheting or knitting style. Each stitch appears evenly spaced and uniform, matching the knitting style seen in other elements, such as the donkey. When recognizing crochet or knitting textures, these features are indicative of good craftsmanship.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the mane and striped pattern on the donkey display natural yarn-like texture and proper alignment without visible distortions or gaps between stitches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donkey's mane and striped pattern reflect a coherent yarn texture typical of crocheted objects. The alignment of colors and the integration into the donkey's body show no discrepancies or gaps, implying a seamless crafting technique. Such uniformity and texture are critical in achieving a polished appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the limbs and body proportions of both the cactus and donkey preserved in a way that reflects typical plush toy design without unnatural stretching or shrinking?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the proportions of both the cactus and donkey adhere to standard plush toy designs, where the body parts are balanced and proportionate. There are no visible signs of distortion, stretching, or shrinking, which would otherwise suggest editing errors or poor design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the packaging box positioned in a way that suggests it is part of the same scene, with consistent lighting and shadow direction relative to the plush toys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging box appears integrated into the scene with light and shadow directions consistent with those on the cactus and donkey. The light appears to illuminate both objects similarly, aligning them in a cohesive environmental setup, typical of product photography.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows clean boundaries between objects and the background. There is no presence of jagged edges, color bleeding, or double outlines, all of which would indicate poor editing or image manipulation. The edges are smooth and well-defined, which is expected in high-quality renders or photographs.",
