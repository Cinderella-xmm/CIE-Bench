      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pelican's beak elongated but still attached naturally to the head without bending or breaking at the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's beak is cartoonish and very exaggerated in length, which is typical in stylized illustrations. It appears attached to the head without any visible bending or breaking; the beak flows naturally into the design of the head despite its exaggerated size. It retains a look of cohesion with the pelican's head, suggesting it is part of a stylistically whole design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the pelican’s feathers display visible layered texture despite being colored in pastel shades, without appearing uniformly smooth or pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican is depicted in a cartoon style which uses simplified shading and outlines. The feathers are represented with colored lines indicating layers, offering a sense of texture despite the pastel coloration. There is no pixelation; the lines and colors are smooth, coherent with cartoon illustration techniques.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the sailor hat positioned securely on the pelican’s head without overlapping the neck or appearing detached from the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sailor hat in Image B is settled on the pelican's head in a manner typical of cartoon styling, which doesn't adhere to realistic proportions but rather prioritizes visual appeal. The hat fits the head without overlapping the neck and visually connects with the head, maintaining stylistic unity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wooden plank background extend evenly behind the pelican without visible seams or inconsistencies in wood grain or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a uniform wooden surface with even wood grain patterning and consistent lighting. There are no seams or visual disruptions; the surface is continuous, aligning with the expectations for a wooden table or similar flat surface.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pelican’s legs and feet proportionally aligned with the body and not distorted or bent in an unnatural way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cartoon representation of Image B, the pelican's legs and feet are simplified yet proportional to the exaggerated body size typical of such illustrations. The limbs are drawn solidly and appear in a natural stance consistent with the style, without distortion or unnatural bending.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the pelican appear as a flat, two-dimensional object with minimal depth cues and clean edges, consistent with a magnet design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is depicted with strong outlines and flat colors, characteristics of two-dimensional designs. These features suggest that the pelican is part of a sticker or magnet-like illustration, emphasizing flatness and clean distinct edges without depth cues typical of three-dimensional objects.",
