      "question": "Do the chibi sheep maintain their original interaction pose by the railing in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi sheep are positioned side by side facing the railing. They appear friendly and are leaning against the railing, suggesting an interaction with an unseen object or character. This pose replicates a typical interaction scenario where characters or animals engage with something beyond a barrier. Image A shows real animals interacting similarly at a railing, indicating that this type of pose has been maintained in Image B while adapting to a cartoon style. The core interaction of being next to a railing is preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the winter accessories (scarves, earmuffs, gloves) added to the chibi sheep free from unnatural textures and retain fine details similar to the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the winter accessories such as earmuffs, scarves, and gloves are incorporated into the chibi sheep design. These accessories are stylized to match the cartoon nature of the image, featuring smooth, bold lines and solid colors typical of chibi art. These elements do not display any unnatural textures that contrast with the simplistic and cute style of the drawing. The textures are consistent with the minimalistic detail characteristic of chibi illustrations, suggesting no deviation from the expected style.",

      "question": "Do the proportions and poses of the chibi sheep appear physically plausible and coherent with the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi sheep have exaggerated proportions typical of the chibi style, characterized by a large head and small body, which emphasizes cuteness over realism. Despite these stylized proportions, the poses are coherent with a common scene setup where multiple characters are shown interacting or socializing at a barrier or fence. The cartoon style inherently allows for certain proportional liberties, but within this context, the placement and interaction depicted maintain internal coherence within the art style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the flat, cartoonish style conversion of the sheep maintain a sense of realism without introducing obvious unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonish style conversion simplifies the detail levels into a flat, stylized illustration. This transformation is intentional and focuses on maintaining the cute appeal characteristic of chibi art. The image does not aim for realism; instead, it embraces its flat style, which is coherent and deliberate. Due to the consistent line work, color application, and absence of unnatural artifacts such as pixelation or misalignment, the conversion is effective within its intended style.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the edited image, including the chibi sheep and their accessories, preserve visual credibility and structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition features three chibi sheep, each with distinct winter accessories, arranged side by side in front of a railing. This setup is visually balanced, with each element aligned and proportionate within the context of chibi art. The simple background accentuates the characters, maintaining focus and clarity. The structural elements such as the fence and accessories are consistent with the cartoon aesthetic, preserving visual credibility within the stylized framework.",
