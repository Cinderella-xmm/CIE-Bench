      "question": "Does the melted cheese appear with a natural texture and color, without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the melted cheese is visibly yellow-orange and appears to have a smooth texture that is consistent with how real melted cheese would look when spread over a hot dog. There are no visual signs of unnatural artifacts such as overly sharp edges or unusual coloring that would deviate from what is expected from melted cheese. The sheen on the cheese indicates a realistic melting effect, commonly observed in real-life cooking scenarios.",

      "question": "Are the fried onions positioned naturally on the hot dog, avoiding any distortion or breakage of geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fried onions are scattered over the hot dog in a way that one would expect them to be naturally sprinkled, with an appealing randomness and without any evident geometric distortion or breakage. The pieces of fried onions maintain their rounded shapes and do not appear unnaturally fragmented or misaligned.",

      "question": "Do the melted cheese and fried onions blend seamlessly with the hot dog buns and sausages, preserving structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the melted cheese and fried onions integrated with the hot dog buns and sausages. The cheese lies snugly on top of the onions and follows the contour of the sausage, while the fried onions sit comfortably on the cheese. There is a coherent visual integration of these elements, without evident separation or mismatch that would suggest artificial editing.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the details of the melted cheese and fried onions preserved without losing clarity or introducing blurry textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details of the melted cheese and fried onions are clearly defined. The cheese has a lustrous surface with visible lines that are characteristic of a melting process, while the texture of the fried onions is distinct, with each piece having a sharp appearance. There is no notable loss of clarity or blurry textures, confirming good preservation of detail.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the barbecue tong look naturally placed near the grill, maintaining its structural integrity and proportion with the rest of the image elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The barbecue tong in Image B is positioned at a logical angle above the hot dogs, indicative of use rather than being artificially inserted. The perspective and size of the tong are proportional in comparison to the hot dogs and the grill, maintaining structural integrity and coherence with other objects in the image. It integrates well, without appearing awkward or out-of-place.",
