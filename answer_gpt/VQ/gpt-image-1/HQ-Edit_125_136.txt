    "Question": "Q1: Are the shapes of the astronaut's helmet, suit segments, and life support pack simplified but still geometrically consistent with their original forms without jagged or broken edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is depicted in a simplified, cartoonish style which aligns with a simplified geometric representation. The helmet is round, the segments of the suit are smooth, and the life support pack has basic, clear dimensions. These shapes are consistent with the geometric forms seen in a typical spacesuit, though they lack detail due to the stylization but there are no jagged or broken edges.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the texture applied to the spacesuit appear uniformly distributed and physically plausible, without unnatural repetition or artificial pattern artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a cartoon style where textures such as fabric detail are not depicted, aiming instead for a graphical representation with flat colors. In this context, the spacesuit is uniformly colored and lacks complex textures. This absence of artificial pattern artifacts is consistent with the graphic style employed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the accent gold colors confined to specific design elements (such as patch borders or connectors) and do they blend naturally without color bleed into adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, accent gold colors are used strategically for specific visual elements, such as the edges of patches and connectors. These accents stand out against the suit without any apparent color bleed or blending issues into other areas, maintaining clean separation typical of digital illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the directional arrows show clear movement from the astronaut toward the ISS without overlapping or distorting the astronautâ€™s limbs or the station structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the directional arrows are prominently included to indicate motion. They are clearly positioned and do not intersect or obscure the astronaut's limbs or the structure of the ISS. This clear positioning aids in understanding the intended direction of movement within the illustration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the text positioned at the bottom edge of the image without covering critical parts of the Moon or ISS, and is it clearly readable without distortion or shadow effects?",
    "explanation": "Image B features text at the top edge rather than the bottom, which suggests an error in the question's context. The text is clearly readable, without distortion or shadow effects, and does not obscure any significant elements like the astronaut or ISS.",
    "answer": "No"
