    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the cat’s body defined by clear, continuous, and uniform bold lines that follow its natural silhouette without distortion or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the cat’s body are depicted using bold lines which delineate its shape clearly without distortion or gaps. The visual style seems to emphasize defined contours typical in graphic art illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the color of the sunglasses uniformly flat orange without any reflection, gradient, or texture, and does it maintain the original shape and position on the cat’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses are rendered in flat orange and maintain uniformity in color without reflections, gradients, or texture variations. They appear positioned on the cat’s face similarly to Image A, in alignment with an illustrative style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the beach background been converted into solid, non-blended color blocks for the sky, ocean, and sand, with no visible texture or natural gradient transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the beach background as a series of solid color blocks representing the sky, ocean, and sand, devoid of any texture or gradients. This indicates the use of a flat, illustrative approach versus the natural gradient seen in a photographic style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the harness depicted using a smooth gradient fill instead of realistic fabric texture, and are the shadows under the cat composed of gradient colors rather than natural light-based shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the harness appears in a solid uniform color without realistic fabric texture. Shadows, if present, are depicted using simplified, solid coloring rather than gradient colors, depicting an emphasis on graphic illustration techniques.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all major elements in the image—including the cat, sunglasses, hot dog, and background—rendered exclusively in red, blue, or yellow, with no other colors present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a limited color palette of red, blue, and yellow to render all major elements including the cat, sunglasses, hot dog, and background. The entire composition adheres strictly to these colors, indicative of a pop-art or graphic style.",
