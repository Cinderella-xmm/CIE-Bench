    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the added kneeling figure have five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no distorted joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure labeled in step 1 has hand shapes that visually represent five fingers. The fingers are represented in a simplified form that appears cartoonish but do not show any visible distortion or unnatural joint bending, aligning with the artistic style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the legs and torso of the leaping figure properly extended and aligned to reflect forward momentum without broken or warped limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaping figure, modeled after an animated character, exhibits extended limbs and a torso that pull naturally in the direction of the leap. There is no sign of broken or warped limbs, as the figure follows the intended dynamic pose of forward momentum.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the knees tucked tightly toward the chest with natural curvature and no visible deformation in the leg muscles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image figure, the knees are positioned close to the chest in an action pose, mimicking a powerful leap. The musculature is depicted with smooth curvature and a natural look without any deformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bold outlines follow the contours of the figure smoothly without jagged edges or color spillage into adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bold outlines in the edited image follow the contours of the character smoothly and cleanly. There are no jagged edges or signs of color bleeding into adjacent areas, maintaining the integrity of the artwork.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the text captions and step numbers positioned so they do not cover key facial features or limbs of the main figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text captions and step numbers are strategically placed around the main figure, avoiding any overlap with facial features or limbs, which allows the viewer to clearly see these features without obstruction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the simplified figures in each step scaled consistently with the original character and aligned in perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The simplified figures in each instructional step are designed to match the proportions and perspective of the original character. They maintain the visual consistency needed for illustrative clarity.",
