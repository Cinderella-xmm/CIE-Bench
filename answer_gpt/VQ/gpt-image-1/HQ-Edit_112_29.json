      "question": "Does the ship retain its original structural shape and proportion when rendered as part of a spherical globe, without visible warping or stretching of the hull or sails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a ship encapsulated within a spherical glass dome. Despite being inside a round globe, the ship appears to maintain its structural shape and proportions, with the hull and sails depicted without obvious warping or stretching. The consistent lines and angles suggest that the transition from the open sea setting to within a globe did not distort its form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass dome transparent with realistic reflections and refractions, and does the wooden base display natural wood grain and intricate compass engravings without pixelation or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a glass dome that is clearly transparent, showcasing realistic reflections and refractions that contribute to an authentic glass appearance. The wooden base has a visible wood grain texture, complemented by decorative compass engravings that are clear and precise, devoid of pixelation or repetitive textures, enhancing the natural look of both the glass and wood components.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sea creatures clearly visible beneath the ship, properly scaled, and positioned in a manner consistent with underwater motion, without appearing floating unnaturally or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sea creatures, including dolphins, are visible beneath the ship within the globe. They appear properly scaled relative to the size of the ship and are placed in positions that suggest natural underwater motion. Their appearances do not seem unnatural or distorted, maintaining the consistency of underwater life.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sails exhibit fine fabric details such as wrinkles and weave patterns that align with the lighting direction and do not show unnatural seams or repeating patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sails of the ship within the globe show fine fabric details, including wrinkles and subtle weave patterns that align with the direction of light coming from the depicted moon. These details appear natural, with no visible seams or repeating patterns that would detract from their realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the internal clouds smoothly shaped and distributed within the dome without clipping into the ship or glass surface, and do they have soft edges and luminous quality consistent with being lit from above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates clouds inside the glass dome that are smoothly shaped and well-distributed around the ship. They do not appear to clip into the ship or the glass surface, maintaining a coherent composition. The clouds have soft edges and a luminous quality, indicating lighting consistent with moonlight from above, contributing to the atmospheric effect.",
