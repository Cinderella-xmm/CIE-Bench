      "question": "Are the facial features on the frame near the handlebars seamlessly integrated with the red surface, showing no visible seams, texture mismatch, or color artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cartoon character with facial features integrated onto the bicycle frame. The facial features are smoothly integrated onto the red surface with uniform color matching and texture consistency, suggesting a design that appears intentional and cohesive, without any visible seams or artifacts that could indicate poor integration.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows motion lines positioned beside the bike, angled to suggest forward movement. They are carefully placed so as not to interfere with the chain, derailleur, or 'DUCATI' branding, maintaining the visibility and integrity of these elements.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the frame retain its original tubular structure and dimensional consistency despite the added hero suit design, with no bulges, collapses, or incorrect curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon styling in Image B includes a character design overlaying the bike while maintaining the bike's original frame structure. The bike's tubular design and dimensional integrity are preserved, displaying a consistent curvature without any deformities like bulges or collapses.",

      "question": "Are the sound effect texts positioned outside the main structural components of the bike and oriented in a way that suggests movement, without obscuring the “DUCATI” branding or control levers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sound effect texts 'VROOM!' and 'ZOOM!' are strategically placed outside of the bike's structural components. They are positioned to suggest dynamic movement while ensuring that key components and branding, such as the 'DUCATI' logo, remain unobscured.",
