    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D ballerina figure inside the snow globe maintain anatomically correct proportions and joint alignment, matching the original dancer's pose without exaggerated or broken limbs?",
    "explanation": "The 3D ballerina figure in the snow globe closely mirrors the pose of the original dancer, maintaining anatomically correct proportions and joint alignment. This is evidenced by the natural flow of the limbs and the gracefulness of the pose, which do not exhibit any exaggerated or broken features common in realistic representations of ballet movements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the base of the snow globe display realistic bronze texture with subtle reflective highlights and clearly defined engraved French script, without pixelation or synthetic-looking patterns?",
    "explanation": "The base of the snow globe is designed to mimic a realistic bronze texture, showcased by the metallic sheen and the way light subtly highlights the contours. The engraved French script 'Le RÃªve de la Danse' is crisply defined, lacking any pixelation or artificial patterns, consistent with high-quality materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the snowflakes inside the globe evenly dispersed and varied in shape and size, appearing to float naturally without repeating patterns or clumping?",
    "explanation": "Observing the snowflakes within the globe, they appear to be evenly dispersed throughout the scene, providing a dynamic and varied appearance. The difference in shape and size contributes to a natural snowfall effect, avoiding unrealistic repeating patterns or clumping.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the Eiffel Tower and surrounding Parisian landmarks scaled down appropriately and geometrically intact, maintaining correct perspective and structural details without warping or flattening?",
    "explanation": "The Eiffel Tower and other landmarks have been carefully scaled down to fit within the snow globe while maintaining their structural integrity. The perspective is preserved with attention to detail, ensuring that these elements remain recognizable and geometrically intact, devoid of any warping or flattening.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the glass dome of the snow globe exhibit natural refraction and subtle bending of internal elements, with smooth curvature and no jagged edges or abrupt transitions?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome shows a smooth curvature and natural refraction, slightly bending the appearance of the internal elements. This creates an authentic optical distortion expected in such a setting. There are no visible jagged edges or abrupt transitions, lending to the perception of a high-quality, realistic glass surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
