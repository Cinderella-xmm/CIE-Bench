    "Question": "Q2: Do the strawberries retain their original shape and size when repurposed as a hat, without any visible warping or stretching?",
    "explanation": "The strawberries in Image B are repurposed as a hat on the cake character and are depicted in a cartoon style that simplifies and exaggerates their shape.

    "Question": "Q4: Are the strawberries and garnishes arranged around the cake in a way that maintains structural balance and does not overlap or distort the cake’s base or side layers?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the strawberries are creatively utilized as part of the cake's design, and no additional garnishes are visibly interfering with the structure, base, or side layers.

    "Question": "Q5: Does the depiction of the cake shaking its head maintain the rigidity of the cake’s structure without suggesting unnatural flexing or bending of the layers?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the cake animatedly shaking its head, which is an artistic expression typical of cartoons where the original rigidity can be temporarily flexible. However, within this art style, there's no implication of the cake's real-world layers bending; it's a metaphorical depiction, maintaining the character's integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
