      "question": "Is the lens area transformed into eyes with smooth, symmetrical shapes and natural-looking reflections, without jagged edges or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lens area is altered to resemble eyes, which are smooth and symmetrical. There are reflections that mimic light spots typical for cartoon eyes, adding a natural look. The transition from lens to eyes is seamless, without noticeable jagged edges or lighting inconsistencies. This transformation corresponds well with typical cartoon styling, where eye shapes are designed to be visually pleasing and uniform.",
