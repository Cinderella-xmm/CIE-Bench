      "question": "Do the sushi pieces forming the human figure maintain a natural and coherent structure without any visible breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sushi pieces are arranged to form a human figure, with each piece clearly placed to depict the head, body, arms, and legs. The arrangement appears natural and coherent, as the sushi pieces smoothly connect to form a recognizable human shape without any gaps or distortions. This indicates a thoughtful construction using the sushi pieces.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the sushi pieces used to form the human figure consistent with the original sushi map, without any unnatural color variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows sushi pieces that are consistent in color with those used in Image A. The colors of the sushi fillings, predominantly orange for salmon, along with cucumber and other ingredients, match the colors used in the sushi map. There are no unnatural color variations, indicating consistency between the two images.",

      "question": "Are the edges of the sushi pieces forming the human figure sharp and well-defined, without any blurred or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of each sushi piece are clear and sharp, with well-defined boundaries. There are no noticeable blurred or pixelated artifacts, which suggests that the image is of high quality with careful consideration given to the clarity and precision of the sushi piece edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sizes and shapes of the sushi pieces forming the human figure proportionate and realistic compared to the original sushi pieces, without any unnatural scaling or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sushi pieces used to form the human figure appear to be proportionate and cohesive, similar to those seen in the sushi map from Image A. There is no indication of unnatural scaling or distortion, and the sushi pieces maintain a realistic appearance in their arrangement, showcasing careful attention to proportionality.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the sushi pieces to form the lifted arm appear anatomically plausible, without any unnatural bends or angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of sushi pieces to form the human figure's lifted arm follows an anatomically plausible design. The pieces are aligned in a way that mimics a natural arm movement without any awkward bends or angles, reflecting a reasonable and thoughtful positioning.",
