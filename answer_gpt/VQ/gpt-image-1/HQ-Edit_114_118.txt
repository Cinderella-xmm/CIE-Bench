    "Question": "Q1: Does the curved glass dome have a smooth, seamless surface without visible seams, scratches, or unnatural distortions that disrupt the visual continuity of the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome appears to be a smooth, convex shape that encases the ship in a visually appealing manner. The way light reflects off the surface suggests it is continuous and without seams or scratches. The curved nature of the dome ensures that the reflections and refractions seen across its surface are consistent and uninterrupted. Therefore, the dome does not have visible seams, scratches, or unnatural distortions, maintaining the visual continuity of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the sails exhibit layered, folded paper-like textures with consistent shadows and depth, without geometric distortions or flattened areas that deviate from their original shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sails on the ship exhibit a distinct appearance of layered and folded paper, which is enhanced by the application of light and shadow. These shadows and highlights give the sails a sense of depth and dimensionality, suggesting a three-dimensional form consistent with folded paper. There are no visible geometric distortions or flattened regions on the sails that would typically indicate deviations from the intended shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the blue resin layer below the ship show consistent translucency, internal glow, and wave-like patterns without abrupt transitions or unnatural textures at the hull interface?",
    "explanation": "The resin layer in Image B appears as a consistent blue layer with properties that mimic water, including wave-like patterns and a subtle translucency that contributes to an impression of depth and texture. This layer seems to smoothly integrate with the model of the ship, and there are no sudden texture changes or unnatural artifacts at the interface where it meets the ship's hull.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the seagulls connected by faint, straight wires that do not interfere with their natural flight positions or create visible mechanical supports?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the seagulls appear to be suspended freely in natural flight positions above the ship, contributing to the overall aesthetic without obvious mechanical supports. There are no visible wires or supports that would typically indicate a mechanical attachment, allowing the seagulls to maintain an appearance of free motion, which aligns with the natural scene.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all elements (ship, sails, water, birds, sky) correctly positioned and scaled within the glass dome without clipping, overlapping, or misalignment that compromises structural coherence?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases all elements—the ship, sails, water, birds, and sky—arranged in a manner that is coherent and visually balanced within the dome. There is no evidence of clipping or misalignment; each element appears proportionately scaled to fit within the confines of the dome. The composition supports a harmonious scene where each component contributes to the overall coherence and structural integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
