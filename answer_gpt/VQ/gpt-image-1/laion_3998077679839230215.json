      "question": "Is the outline of the purple blouse magnet smooth and symmetrical, with recognizable embroidered patterns intact and not blurred or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The purple blouse magnet is designed with clean and precise contours, showing symmetry in its structure. The embroidered patterns on the blouse are clear and distinct, maintaining integrity without any signs of blurring or fragmentation. This observation is derived from the clear depiction of the magnet's design and texture.",

      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the lehenga magnet evenly spaced and symmetrically arranged, with no broken or misaligned designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns on the lehenga magnet appear to be uniformly spaced and symmetrically arranged, with consistent designs that show no signs of being broken or misaligned. This conclusion comes from observing the lehenga magnet's structure and design, which demonstrate a high level of accuracy in pattern placement.",

      "question": "Does the red dupatta magnet show a natural curve at the edge, with the border pattern consistently aligned and not stretched or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red dupatta magnet displays a natural curve at its edge, with the border pattern showing alignment and consistency. This is evident from the magnet's accurate representation of the curve and the integrity of the border design without distortion.",
