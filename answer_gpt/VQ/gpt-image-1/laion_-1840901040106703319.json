      "question": "Are the crystal facets on the cabin’s walls, roof, and windows evenly shaped and aligned with the original cabin’s triangular and rectangular outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited crystal cabin retains the triangular and rectangular outline that is consistent with traditional architectural designs seen in cabins, which include triangular rooflines and rectangular windows. Each facet of crystal imitates those shapes, structured to follow the same geometrical outlines as Image A, where wooden components would lie in a typical cabin. The editing involves careful alignment and shaping of crystal facets to mimic an original architectural design, which implies a deliberate arrangement. Therefore, the shapes and alignment are precise to match the original structure’s configuration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the blue and green hues on the crystal surfaces show variations in transparency and light reflection consistent with real glass or crystal, rather than uniform solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited crystal surfaces exhibit a dynamic range of colors and hues, with blue and green tones that suggest properties typical of glass or crystal surfaces. These colors reflect variations in light density and angles, leading to different shades and sight transparency, which is characteristic of crystal materials that refract and reflect light diversely. This contrasts with uniform solid color surfaces that do not show such variability. The presence of these effects aligns with how real crystals and glass interact with ambient light.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the vertical support beams and horizontal railings converted into crystal forms that maintain their original spacing, height, and alignment with the cabin’s frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vertical support beams and horizontal railings in Image B are transformed into crystal structures, yet they retain the original framework and spacing that corresponds with architectural integrity seen in Image A. The alignment of these beams is consistent with how they would functionally support a building structure, maintaining both height and spatial intervals that would ensure structural stability. This indication of careful conversion suggests that while the material is altered, the underlying architecture remains intact, ensuring the functional alignment observed in traditional building constructs.",

      "question": "Is the white marble platform beneath the cabin flat, continuous, and free of cracks or irregularities, and does it extend evenly under the entire base of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base beneath the crystal cabin appears to be a white marble platform that is depicted as smooth and evenly continuous, displaying no visible cracks or irregularities that would suggest imperfections. The platform supports the entire base of the cabin, providing a uniform foundation. This seamless appearance is consistent with high-quality marble installations that are known for their smoothness and integrity as foundational supports.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the small crystal formations along the base of the cabin proportionally smaller than the main structure, grouped in clusters, and positioned in a way that suggests natural growth rather than random placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smaller crystal formations in Image B are depicted alongside the base of the main structure, intentionally differing in size to appear diminutive compared to the cabin itself. They are grouped in clusters, with positioning that suggests they are naturally occurring formations rather than arbitrarily placed objects. This clustering mimics natural mineral growth patterns where crystals often form together, supporting an aesthetic of organic development.",
