    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the newly added mission control elements (such as consoles, screens, or panels) geometrically consistent with the room's perspective and do not appear to float or clip through surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background contains multiple screens and consoles, indicative of a mission control room. The placement and angles of these elements are congruent with the vanishing point of the room's perspective, making them appear as natural extensions of the environment. They align well within the room's structure and do not visually conflict with existing surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the color-coded sections for training stages (e.g., Physical Training, Technical Skills) have clean edges and are they positioned so they do not overlap or obscure the astronaut’s suit or feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color-coded sections are distinctly demarcated with sharp edges and strategically placed to the side of the astronaut in Image B. They provide clear information without intruding upon or obscuring the visible parts of the astronaut's suit or feet.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the illustrative icons (e.g., treadmill, simulator) proportionally sized and placed at appropriate distances from the astronaut so they do not appear oversized or misplaced in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The icons in Image B, which accompany each training stage description, are proportionately sized in relation to the astronaut. They are positioned close to their respective text but not so close as to seem compressed or disproportionate in the overall composition, maintaining balance within the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the explanatory text for each training stage clearly readable, properly aligned, and not overlapping with the astronaut’s body or suit components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The explanatory text in Image B is variably colored to contrast against the background and is set apart from the astronaut’s body, allowing for easy readability. The text is aligned with its respective icons and does not overlap with the astronaut’s image, ensuring clarity and ease of reading.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the astronaut’s suit joints (e.g., elbows, knees), gloves, and helmet fully intact with no visible distortion, warping, or missing texture details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The astronaut's suit in Image B appears well-rendered with no evident issues in the texture or structure of joints, gloves, and helmet. The materials and design elements hold consistent and undistorted, corresponding to a realistic depiction of a space suit without any visible errors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the added mission control elements (e.g., consoles, icons) align with the direction of the original ceiling lighting and do not contradict the existing shadow patterns on the floor and astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows within Image B are consistent with the lighting direction, as evident from the ceiling fixtures and existing shadow play. The added elements do not introduce conflicting shadow patterns or highlight discrepancies, maintaining a coherent visual integration with the rest of the scene.",
