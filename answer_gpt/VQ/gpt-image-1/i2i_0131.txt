    "Question": "Q1: Do the refrigerator doors and handles appear proportionally correct and geometrically consistent with typical refrigerator designs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the doors and handles of the refrigerator are analyzed for proportionality and geometry. Typically, refrigerators have vertical handles aligned centrally on the doors, and the doors themselves are of rectangular shape with consistent width and height. The handles are appropriately aligned and the doors are vertically symmetrical. The proportions appear to match common refrigerator design standards, indicating consistency and correctness.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the metallic surfaces of the refrigerator free from unnatural textures, maintaining a consistent and authentic finish throughout?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic surfaces of the refrigerator are observed for texture consistency. A typical stainless steel finish is smooth and reflective without irregular patterns. The image shows a uniform metallic finish without visible blemishes or unnatural textures that might disrupt the authentic look of a standard fridge surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Does the lighting appear uniform across both refrigerators, without noticeable shadows or highlights that disrupt the natural appearance?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, the lighting on the refrigerators should be evenly distributed across surfaces to maintain a natural appearance. Ideal lighting would avoid harsh shadows or glaring highlights that could distort the perception. In this case, the lighting across both refrigerators appears consistent, enhancing their natural look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there smooth transitions where the refrigerators meet the cabinets, without visible seams or edges that break the visual continuity?",
    "explanation": "In assessing Image B for transitions between the refrigerators and cabinets, smooth continuity without visible joints is expected to maintain visual coherence. However, the image presents four separate views of the refrigerator without any cabinets, hence the original question regarding the transition between refrigerators and cabinets is not applicable.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the water dispensers on both refrigerators clearly defined and positioned appropriately, contributing to the overall realism?",
    "explanation": "Evaluating Image B, water dispensers should be clearly outlined and appropriately placed, usually centrally located on a refrigerator door. In Image B, there are clear visual cues indicating the presence and correct positioning of water dispensers on the door, supporting overall appliance realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
