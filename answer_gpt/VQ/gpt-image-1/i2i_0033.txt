    "Question": "Q1: Does the person retain a natural jumping pose that aligns with typical human biomechanics, avoiding any distortion or unnatural posturing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the person's pose is dynamic and action-oriented, with bent knees and an arm raised, which are typical of a jumping pose. This suggests movement and action, commonly depicted in comic or illustrated artwork. The legs and arms are positioned in a way that is consistent with a human jumping, especially when depicted in a stylized format like a comic. The pose is coherent with typical human movements involved in jumping, adhering to biomechanics.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the background blend the graffiti and concrete texture effectively, creating an authentic look without overlapping issues or blending that obscures either element's distinct characteristics?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B incorporates a graffiti style with colorful patterns typical of street art. The concrete texture is implied through the rough, speckled appearance. Both graffiti and concrete elements are distinct, with vibrant colors contrasting against the neutral texture of concrete, maintaining their individual characteristics without interference or blending that would obscure their definitions.",
