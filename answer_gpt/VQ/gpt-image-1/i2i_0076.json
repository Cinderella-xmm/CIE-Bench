      "question": "Does the word \"warm\" blend seamlessly into the top left corner without disrupting the natural appearance and introducing any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word \"warm\" in large, bold text occupies the top left corner. A seamless blend means the text integrates into the background without creating any noticeable distractions or disrupting the overall visual flow. The design choice, including color harmony and style, mirrors the adaptive integration of such text in interior design ads, where text often overlays with minimal interference. The text does not show pixelation, misalignment, or incongruity with the background. Therefore, it blends in without seeming unnatural.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the addition of the word \"warm\" at the top left corner maintained the structural consistency of surrounding elements like the sofa and cushions, avoiding any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the area surrounding the top left corner contains the wall and part of the painting. Comparing to Image B, the addition of the word \"warm\" does not interfere with the visible details of the sofa or cushions or cause any distortion. The text is placed strategically to maintain the structural integrity of everything around it. It does not warp or alter the shape or visual consistency of adjacent objects.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the size and font of the word \"warm\" maintain visual plausibility and authentic integration with the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word \"warm\" uses a large, prominent serif font which is commonly used in home decor or lifestyle imagery due to its aesthetic appeal and clarity. The choice in size and font is bold yet classic, providing contrast but not clashing with the calming and structured theme of the room. Its integration feels intentional as part of a marketing message without any irregularities that might make it seem out of place.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the word \"freedom\" at the bottom right corner added in a manner that preserves the fine details of the floor and plant, avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word \"freedom\" appears in the bottom right corner. Observing this area for text-related artifacts involves ensuring no visible degradation or loss of detail in the floor texture or plant surfaces. The text overlay respects the grain of the floor and contours of the plant without introducing any visible artifacts or loss of sharpness. This demonstrates careful handling to maintain image quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement of the word \"freedom\" at the bottom right corner respect the structural integrity of nearby elements, such as the corner of the rug and plant pot base, without causing any visible distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis involves looking at how the word \"freedom\" interacts with elements in its vicinity, such as the rug corner and the plant pot. The placement does not interfere with or distort these elements visually. In Image B, the text occupies its designated space without causing shifts or alignment issues in the rug pattern or plant pot position. This demonstrates effective and non-intrusive integration within the scene.",
