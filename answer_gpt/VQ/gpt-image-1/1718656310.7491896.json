    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the stained glass wings feature consistent, smooth patterns without jagged edges or pixelated textures, and do they appear to transmit light naturally as if made of glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained glass wings reveal a design with uniform, smooth edges. The patterns in the wings show a leaf-like structure with integrated colors that create the impression of transmitted light, akin to real stained glass, which is commonly associated with smooth transitions and light refraction properties. There are no visible jagged edges or pixelated textures, contributing to a cohesive and glass-like appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dress composed of leaf-like and vine-like elements that maintain natural curvature, shading, and thickness, with no visible seams or synthetic textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B has been designed to closely mimic natural leaves and vines. It shows appropriate shading, which reflects the lighting, simulating a three-dimensional structure with depth and thickness similar to real foliage. The elements interweave smoothly without showing seams or any synthetic appearance, making the dress appear organic and fitting within a forest setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glowing mushrooms and twinkling fireflies integrated into the background with consistent lighting and depth, avoiding floating or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing mushrooms and the fireflies are positioned seamlessly within the background. Their lighting is consistent with the overall environmental illumination, which enhances the natural forest ambiance. These elements don't seem out of place or suspended unnaturally, suggesting that they were integrated with regard to appropriate depth and spatial alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do both hands show five fingers each with natural joint alignment, smooth skin texture, and no distortion or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the figure each have five fingers, with joints appearing in their natural locations. The skin texture is even and smooth throughout, without any visual distortions or anomalies such as extra digits or misaligned fingers. This attention to anatomical accuracy helps maintain the realism of the figureâ€™s hands.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the legs positioned in a physically plausible seated posture with natural knee and ankle angles, and no elongation or compression of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The legs in Image B are arranged in a manner consistent with a realistic seated position. The angles at the knees and ankles appear proportional, with no signs of undue elongation or compression. The posture reflects a stable and believable sitting arrangement, consistent with natural human anatomy during such an activity.",
