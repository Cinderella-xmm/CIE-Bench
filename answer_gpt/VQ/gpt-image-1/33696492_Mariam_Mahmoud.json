        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chairs and stools have been replaced with objects resembling natural rocks, characterized by uneven surfaces.

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the book-to-bird transformations show complete bird bodies with defined heads, wings, and tails, and do the feathers contain readable text fragments arranged in a natural pattern without distorted letters or gaps?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformations from books to birds in Image B depict well-formed bird figures with defined heads, wings, and tails. The feathers contain text fragments that are arranged naturally, lacking distortion or gaps, and maintain the illusion of being part of the feathersâ€™ texture. This transformation keeps the essence of the original objects while creatively integrating textual elements into the visual design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling is formed by entwined branches that are connected and interlaced naturally, without gaps or floating segments.
