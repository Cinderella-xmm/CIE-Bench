      "question": "Does the desk exhibit continuous, realistic embossed wood textures across its surface without visible seams, irregularities, or artificial-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The desk in Image B shows a highly detailed wood texture typical of engravings, giving a three-dimensional look with consistent patterns. The visual cues suggest a uniform design resembling carved motifs and embossed details that are characteristic of classic styles. Knowledge of typical woodwork aesthetics can help assess the realistic representation, especially for a vintage theme. There are no seams or irregularities disrupting the surface, suggesting a seamless texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the writing pad positioned flatly on the desk with uniform edges and natural aging effects such as slight discoloration and texture variation, without warped or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the writing pad appears to be neatly placed on the desk, exhibiting uniform edges and a visibly precise alignment. The paper shows subtle signs of aging, such as slight discoloration and texture nuances typical of vintage materials. These visual characteristics provide evidence that the pad is logically situated without any warping or irregularities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the quill-shaped logo rendered with a raised, metallic gold finish that shows subtle highlights and shadows consistent with embossed foil, without smearing or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The quill logo in Image B features a metallic gold finish with the appropriate highlights and shadows expected from an embossed element. Understanding the effect of lighting on such a material type, the highlights and shadows suggest a high-quality foil-like embossing, without any inconsistencies like smearing or unrealistically bright gloss.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ink bottle placed stably on the desk surface with proportional size and shape consistent with real glass bottles, and does the spine of the pad show clear, readable etched text without blurring or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ink bottle in Image B appears to be stably positioned on the desk and its size and shape are realistically rendered to be consistent with typical glass bottle designs. The spine of the pad, where there would typically be etched or printed text, shows no indications of blurring or ghosting, ensuring clarity and readability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all modified elements (desk, pad, quill logo, ink bottle) proportionally aligned and spatially coherent, forming a unified vintage stationery package layout without floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cohesive composition where each element—desk, pad, quill logo, and ink bottle—appears proportionally and spatially coherent within the layout. There are no elements that seem disjointed or misplaced based on visual alignment or proportional accuracy, which are key in creating a unified design, specifically for packaging of vintage stationery.",
