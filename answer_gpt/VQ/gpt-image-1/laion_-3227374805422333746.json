      "question": "Are the wooden planks on the walls seamlessly integrated with no visible gaps, misalignment, or unnatural texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden planks on the building walls exhibit a seamless integration with their surroundings. Observing the building structure, the planks are evenly arranged without any visible gaps or irregular alignments. Given the textures used, they appear deliberate with no unnatural repetition. This demonstrates a meticulous design where different elements are well integrated to create a cohesive look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss texture cover only appropriate surfaces (e.g., lower stone blocks, corners) and appear layered and organic without floating or flat patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moss texture in Image B appears to be strategically placed on appropriate surfaces, such as the base and corners, where moss naturally gathers due to moisture. The texture shows layering and depth, indicating an organic placement without signs of floating or flatness, which would otherwise break the realistic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the roof tiles, walls, and wooden elements uniformly adjusted to earthy tones without inconsistent color gradients or localized discoloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coloring of roof tiles, walls, and wooden elements has been adjusted to a cohesive earthy tone. The consistency in color gradients across different structural elements helps maintain a natural look devoid of any abrupt discolorations or mismatched colors, creating visual harmony in the imagery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature characters correctly scaled relative to the house and positioned in plausible locations (e.g., near doors, paths) without floating or intersecting with structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature characters in Image B have been correctly scaled relative to the house, making them appear as part of the house environment. The positioning beside doors, implying entry or guarding positions, respects plausible locations. They are situated in a manner that shows grounding and integration into the scene without indications of floating or intersection with the structural elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the parchment board positioned flat on the ground with realistic folds, texture, and shadow alignment matching the light source direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parchment board in Image B is seen flat on the ground with details like fold marks and texture showing depth. Its shadow direction aligns with the light source, supporting the visual perception of a flat surface placement. These features are well-executed to ensure the board appears naturally resting on the ground without alignment issues.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the rule booklets have consistent page thickness, visible spine details, and shadows that align with the lighting and surface they rest on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rule booklets in Image B reveal consistent page thickness as seen in the slightly open pages. Their spine details are visibly textured, adding realism. The shadows cast align perfectly with the light source's direction, reinforcing the physics of how light interacts with objects. This coherence in detail reflects an attention to realistic shadow and thickness representation.",
