      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the plastic figurine maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the character's body, avoiding distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plastic figurine features exaggerated proportions typical of chibi or collectible figures, which involve a larger head and shorter limbs compared to realistic human proportions. This design choice is intentional and accepted within the context of collectible figures. Therefore, within the expectations for such a stylized depiction, the figurine maintains consistent proportions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting effects depicted are stylized like electricity arcs around the hammer and figure, common in visual representations of superhero abilities.

      "question": "Do the hands of the plastic figurine holding the hammer retain natural textures and shapes, with no more than five fingers and no signs of ergonomic distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands of the plastic figurine are stylized but consistent with the expected design of chibi figures. They have a simplified, rounded form, yet they hold the hammer correctly with no obvious distortions. The fingers are distinguishable and limited in number as expected for such stylized figurines.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor and cape of the plastic figure are designed to be consistent with its stylized appearance, utilizing smooth textures and simplified details.
