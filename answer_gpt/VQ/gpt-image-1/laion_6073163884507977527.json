      "question": "Does the glass dome cover the entire scene without distorting the underlying elements such as the house, tree, or ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome encases the entire scene including the house, tree, and other elements. The dome appears to be a clear glass cover that does not introduce visual distortion, meaning the objects inside retain their shape and proportions without any bending or warping effects that would indicate optical distortion.",

      "question": "Are the mossy green pathways aligned with the terrain level and blended naturally with the surrounding ground texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mossy green pathways in Image B appear to be well-integrated into the landscape, following the natural slope and contours of the scene. There are no abrupt transitions or visible separation lines, indicating that they blend seamlessly with the surrounding ground texture, maintaining a harmonious look with the rest of the terrain.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the newly added shrubs have a size and texture consistent with the existing plants in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shrubs in Image B are consistent in size and texture with the existing greenery. They do not appear disproportionately large or small in comparison to the other elements such as the trees and grass, and their texture aligns with the mossy, tactile quality evident in the scene. This consistency creates a cohesive look in the miniaturized landscape.",

      "question": "Is the lake positioned on the ground with defined edges and a reflective surface that interacts realistically with surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lake is placed at the bottom of the scene with clear and defined edges. The reflective surface of the lake mirrors the surrounding elements such as the greenery and the bridge, which suggests a high level of realism. The positioning respects the terrain, giving the full impression of a natural water body within the environment.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fairy lights wrapped around the tree branches in a way that follows their shape and emits a soft, uniform glow without harsh highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fairy lights in Image B are delicately arranged around the tree branches, following the contours and shapes effectively. They emit a consistent, soft glow that enhances the aesthetic without creating harsh glare or highlights that would disrupt the visual harmony of the scene. The even distribution suggests careful attention to detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bridge span the lake with stable supports and connect directly to the ground on both sides without floating or tilting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge spans across the lake, firmly anchored on both sides, and looks structurally sound. The supports are placed properly, and the bridge appears to me firmly seated on the ground level without any visible signs of floating, tilting, or misalignment, adding to the stability and realism of the miniature scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All newly added elements in Image B are created to enhance the existing rustic charm of the scene. The dome is clear, the lake has a natural look with reflective properties, the bridge is of simple yet effective construction, and the lights enhance the fairy tale atmosphere without deviating from the warm, inviting tone of the scene. The materials and lighting are chosen carefully to match the original aesthetic, ensuring a cohesive appearance.",
