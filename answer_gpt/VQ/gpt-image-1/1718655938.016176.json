      "question": "Are the outlines of the church's steeple, roof, and walls clearly defined and geometrically consistent, without broken or warped edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church is depicted with bold, well-defined outlines that are clean and consistent throughout its structure. The steeple, roof, and walls feature smooth, precise lines that create a simplified cartoon-like appearance. This style suggests intentional geometric consistency, typical in animated illustrations to ensure clarity and ease of recognition.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the stained-glass windows display clear, coherent patterns with smooth color transitions and no pixelation or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a flat, colorful illustration style with windows showing simplified geometric designs rather than traditional stained-glass patterns. The windows are filled with solid colors, lacking intricate stained-glass patterns and a smooth gradient often found in real-life stained-glass. The focus appears to be on presenting vibrant color blocks instead of textural transitions or detailed patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the candy-like tree replacements composed of smooth, continuous shapes with consistent surface textures, and do they maintain plausible proportions relative to the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The candy-like trees in Image B are designed in a playful, exaggerated manner, resembling lollipops and candy canes. Their shapes are smooth and consistent with the whimsical style of the illustration. The proportions of these elements are intentionally exaggerated to enhance the fantastical theme, which fits coherently within the composition relative to the church.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the patchwork quilt sky feature uniform stitching lines and consistent color blending between patches, with no visible seams or sharp discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is composed of swirling pastel colors, typical in cartoon art styles, to create a whimsical backdrop. While there are color blends, they are designed to be bold and vibrant rather than soft gradient transitions. There are no visible stitching lines indicative of a patchwork quilt design, but rather a smooth gradient of colors creating a consistent harmonious look.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the light sources from the church windows cast consistent, soft shadows on the surrounding grass and path, matching the direction and intensity of the internal glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an animated style where the lighting from the church windows is depicted as a simple bright glow, emphasizing contrast rather than realistic shadow casting. The surrounding area does not show traditional shadow play because the style focuses on bold color contrasts and lacks detailed gradient shading associated with realistic lighting effects.",
