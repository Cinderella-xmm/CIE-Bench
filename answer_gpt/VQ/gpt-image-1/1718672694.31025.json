    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the two central tree trunks retain the original towers' vertical proportions and cylindrical form without unnatural tapering or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trunks are tall and cylindrical, resembling tree trunks rather than castle towers. They maintain a vertical proportion similar to the cylindrical forms seen on towers, without exhibiting any unnatural tapering or notable distortion in geometry, suggesting a stylized representation of tree structures.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the branches extending from the trunks seamlessly connected and positioned in a way that follows natural growth patterns, without floating or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branches extending from the trunks in Image B appear to grow naturally from the main structure of the tree, without any segments that appear to be floating or misaligned. They follow natural growth patterns, radiating outward from the trunks, which is typical in real trees.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the glowing leaves at the top of the structure emit a soft, diffused green light that blends with ambient lighting and does not produce sharp halos or overexposed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing leaves in Image B emit a gentle green luminescence, which blends smoothly with the surrounding dark, forest ambiance. There are no sharp halos or overexposed areas, reflecting an effective integration of light sources with ambient lighting for atmospheric effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the root-like spirit figures embedded in the ground smoothly blended with the terrain and free of visible pixelation, edge artifacts, or unnatural translucency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spirit figures in Image B appear to be smoothly blended with the terrain, exhibiting a gentle transition from roots into the soil. There is no evident pixelation, edge artifacts, or unnatural translucency, indicating a well-rendered integration of these ethereal figures with the ground texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bark textures on the trunks and branches show variation in shading and detail consistent with real tree surfaces, without uniform patterns or repeated brushwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bark textures in Image B display variation in shading and intricate detail, resembling real tree surfaces. There is no evidence of uniform patterns or repeated brushwork, creating a natural and realistic depiction of tree bark.",
