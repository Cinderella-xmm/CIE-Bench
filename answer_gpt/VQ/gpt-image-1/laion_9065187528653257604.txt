    "Question": "Q1: Are the neon accents added to the motorcycleâ€™s body emitting a consistent, smooth glow without harsh edges or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle features neon accents that are designed to add a futuristic and stylish effect. When evaluating the neon glow, it's important that it appears smooth and consistent, meaning there's an even gradient of light without jagged edges or visible pixelation that would indicate poor rendering or lack of polish. The visual cues in Image B hint at a high-quality neon effect, indicating the glow is smooth and continuous.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the hover wheels maintain symmetrical, closed geometric forms without visible deformation or broken spokes?",
    "explanation": "The hover wheels in Image B should visually represent uniform circles with clean and complete geometric forms. Symmetry is crucial for maintaining a realistic and cohesive design, where each wheel should appear uniform and without any gaps or distortions that could disrupt the visual integrity. Image B shows hover wheels that are fully formed and symmetrical, which implies a detailed and intentional design that maintains consistency across the structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the digital interface seamlessly embedded in the front panel without intersecting or obscuring existing elements like the headlight or mirrors?",
    "explanation": "A smoothly integrated digital interface indicates that all components, such as the display or holographic elements, are carefully positioned to ensure they do not intersect with or obscure critical motorcycle details. In Image B, the headlight and mirrors should remain unobstructed by any digital modifications, highlighting precise alignment and placement of additional elements within the overall design. The motorcycle in Image B hints at a seamless integration, where all components retain their intended visibility and functionality.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the isometric box exhibit uniform edge lengths and correct angles, with no skewed faces or misaligned corners?",
    "explanation": "The isometric box depicted in Image B should maintain equal dimensions along its sides and angles, ensuring that each face is properly aligned in perspective without skewing. This involves precise geometry where each edge upholds a harmonious structure with no visible misalignments. Image B showcases a packaging design where the edges and angles appear uniform, suggesting careful attention to geometric accuracy in the overall form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the transparent window free of warping, chromatic aberration, or ghosting that would distort the view of the motorcycle behind it?",
    "explanation": "The transparent window on the packaging must clearly present the motorcycle inside, without any visual distortions like warping or chromatic aberration. Ghosting or any form of visual artifact could compromise the clarity and presentation. Image B reflects a clean transparency in its window design, indicating that the areas behind the window are displayed clearly with no apparent visual discrepancies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
