    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the dragon’s body follow the exact winding route of the original dirt path from the foreground to the summit without altering its course or creating unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's body seems to follow the winding path in a flowing manner, matching the dirt trail from the original image without making abrupt or unnatural changes in direction. The dragon's movement appears to complement the natural curvature of the path seen in Image A. The reasoning involves visually assessing the edited image to see if the dragon aligns with the path's original curves, using knowledge of how creatures would navigate similar terrains.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the emerald and orange markings on the dragon’s body smoothly rendered with no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or mismatched shading compared to the surrounding terrain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon's markings in Image B show a smooth blend of emerald and orange colors with even shading and no pixelation. The transition between colors is smooth, and there is consistency in how they integrate with the surrounding terrain. This observation is based on comparing texture and color transitions using visual analysis and understanding of digital imagery quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the twisting horns positioned at the dragon’s head near the summit aligned with the hill’s contour and free from clipping into nearby trees or appearing disconnected from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon's horns in Image B are positioned to complement the hill's contour, giving the impression that they rise naturally without interference from nearby trees. They seem to be well-integrated with the body without any disjointed attachment. This assessment comes from the visual positioning of objects in relation to the background and expected logical integration based on visual spatial awareness.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the jade-colored eyes show realistic depth and reflection, and are they proportionally sized and positioned within the dragon’s head without appearing pasted or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jade-colored eyes of the dragon appear realistic, showing depth and reflection that are typical of a creature's eyes. Their size and orientation within the head seem correct and do not give the impression of being digitally pasted or misaligned. This is determined by judging the natural appearance of organic features in the artwork.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the mossy tendrils extending from the dragon’s neck seamlessly integrated with the nearby vegetation, showing consistent texture and growth direction without sharp boundaries or unnatural clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tendrils on the dragon's neck in Image B show a seamless integration with nearby vegetation. There is consistency in texture and growth direction, maintaining a natural flow that avoids sharp boundaries or clustering that would be considered unnatural. This evaluation involves visual comparison to determine organic integration using knowledge of flora textures observed in the environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the dragon’s head positioned at the correct elevation along the ridge, rising naturally from the hillside without appearing unnaturally elevated or detached from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's head fits well within the hillside, rising to a natural elevation consistent with the body. It does not appear elevated above where one might expect based on the body's position, nor does it seem detached. Analyzing the spatial relationship between various parts helps establish if the positioning matches natural morphology.",
