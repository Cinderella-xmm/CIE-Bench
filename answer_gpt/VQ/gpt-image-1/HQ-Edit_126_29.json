      "question": "Does the book animation on the clock face align perfectly with the curved top and vertical frame of the clock, maintaining consistent proportions and smooth transitions between materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is portrayed as if it is a part of the clock's design, specifically on its face. The visual consistency needs to maintain the alignment with the clock's top curve and vertical frame. Observing the image reveals a clear integration, with proportions intact between the book and surrounding elements. The book is centered and harmonizes with the clock’s existing structure without appearing forced or out of proportion, suggesting correct alignment and smooth transitions between the materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the text snippets embedded in the wallpaper clearly legible, evenly spaced, and seamlessly blended into the background pattern without creating unnatural shadows or color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B appears embedded in or on top of the wallpaper. Evaluating legibility involves noting readability, which is clear without distortion or interference, and spacing, which is evenly distributed across the visible area. The text overlays without casting shadows or causing color shifts in the wallpaper, which would indicate poor integration. Therefore, the text is properly embedded and blends seamlessly with the background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the image of the ancient sundial inside the framed artwork properly scaled, centered, and rendered with consistent lighting and depth relative to the original frame and surrounding wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sundial in the framed artwork on Image B is studied for scale — ensuring it fits appropriately within the frame, appears centered, and that its lighting and depth match that of the environment. The sundial is presented appropriately, aligning centrally within the borders of the frame, and consistent lighting indicates it matches surroundings without falling out of place or depth, which ensures proper rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the pen-shaped clock hands appear structurally sound, properly aligned with the book’s cover, and free from distortion such as bent metal parts or mismatched shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pen-shaped clock hands are observed for structural integrity — meaning no bending or distortion should be present. They must align effectively with the book's cover without visual mismatches or shadow discrepancies. These hands are structurally stable, showing alignment without any visible distortion or shadow issues, suggesting appropriate design integration with the book.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the captions placed in the room clearly readable, stylistically consistent with art-nouveau design, and physically integrated into their respective surfaces without overlapping or distorting underlying materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The captions in Image B need examination for readability and design consistency, particularly aligning with art-nouveau style. They should be integrated such that they fit naturally within the environment, avoiding overlay issues or distortion of the building materials. The captions maintain a clear, readable form and reflect the art-nouveau style without interference, presenting themselves seamlessly in accordance with the room's aesthetic.",
