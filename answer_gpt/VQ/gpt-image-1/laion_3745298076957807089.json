    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass stopper on the bottle have a smooth, reflective surface consistent with real glass, and does it fit proportionally with the bottle's neck without appearing oversized or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass stopper on the bottle in Image B appears smooth and reflective, which is characteristic of real glass. It fits the bottle's neck proportionally, without looking oversized or misaligned. This conclusion is drawn from observing the symmetry and proportionality of the stopper with the bottle, as a well-fitted stopper generally complements the bottle's design.",

      "question": "Are the diffuser reeds straight, evenly spaced, and properly aligned with the stopper, showing no signs of jagged edges, unnatural bending, or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The diffuser reeds in Image B are straight and evenly spaced, aligned well with the stopper. They do not exhibit jagged edges, unnatural bending, or clipping artifacts. This assessment is based on the visual cues of alignment, straightness of the reeds, and absence of visual distortions, indicating quality design.",

      "question": "Is the art deco label properly aligned on the front of the bottle, maintaining its rectangular shape and correct proportions without visible warping or texture distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label on the bottle in Image B maintains a rectangular shape with correct proportions, showing no signs of warping or texture distortion. This is concluded from observing the symmetry of the label's edges and the consistent spacing of text and graphics within the label's confines.",

      "question": "Do the floral and botanical illustrations on the label have clear outlines, natural shading, and consistent scale relative to the surrounding text and design elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral and botanical illustrations on the label in Image B have clear outlines and natural shading. The scale of these illustrations is consistent with the surrounding text and design elements, enhancing the aesthetic harmony of the label. The clear depiction of botanical details suggests a consideration for design coherence.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the emerald green and gold colors on the label applied smoothly without visible color fringing, banding, or abrupt transitions between hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The emerald green and gold colors on the label in Image B are applied smoothly, with no visible color fringing, banding, or abrupt transitions between hues. This conclusion is supported by the even distribution of colors and the smooth transitions observed along the edges where different colors meet, signifying quality printing.",
