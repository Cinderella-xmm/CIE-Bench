      "question": "Is the explorer hat placed correctly on the sparrow’s head, matching its scale and shape without deforming the feathers or creating unnatural shadows or seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow wears an explorer hat. The hat fits snugly around the sparrow's head, matching its scale and shape. The placement appears natural, without signs of feathers being unnaturally compressed or distorted. Judging by visual cues, the hat's shading aligns with the lighting conditions on the sparrow, avoiding any unnatural shadows or seams. This conclusion is achieved by observing the consistency of contours and shadows in relation to the bird's overall appearance.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backpack in Image B is proportionately attached to the sparrow's back.

      "question": "Are the stylized map elements positioned where the original oak leaves were, maintaining similar shape and spatial relationship to the branch and bird, with no visible seams or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces the oak leaves with stylized map elements that fill similar regions in the composition. These elements retain consistent spatial relationships with the branch and sparrow, suggesting a layered composition similar to the original setup. There are no visible seams or misalignment as the map motifs have been integrated into the background, reflecting the original spatial composition.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow's feathers retain a fluffy and layered texture, maintaining the original warm earthy tones. These tones and patterns do not appear distorted; rather, they are presented clearly, preserving the bird's natural look despite the stylistic changes accompanying the other elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title text in Image B is prominently positioned at the top, employing a playful font that includes swirling elements. It does not interfere visually with the bird or the background, remaining free from distortion or blur. The font choice complements the adventurous theme without impacting the visibility of the sparrow or other elements.",
