      "question": "Does the cartoon transformation of the baby elephant maintain natural proportions without any noticeable distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baby elephant is a cartoon representation with rounded and soft features that are typical of stylized illustrations intended to convey cuteness. The proportions, such as the large ears and the small, rounded body, align with common aesthetic choices in cartoon depictions. The textures appear smooth and consistent with the flat, color-filled style, which doesn't require detailed or realistic textures. Therefore, considering the style, there are no noticeable distortions or unnatural textures.",

      "question": "Is the text \"First Splash!\" and \"Ele-Baby\" displayed with proper transparency, without obstructing underlying details or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'First Splash!' and 'Ele-Baby' is prominently displayed above and below the cartoon elephant. The text has solid colors and clear edges, which are typical for text overlays on illustrations. There are no visible signs of obstruction of underlying details since the background is transparent and there are no underlying details that might be obscured. The text does not appear to introduce any visual artifacts and is legible against the transparent background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon baby elephant has uniformly rounded edges that contribute to its cute and approachable appearance. The lines defining the elephant's shape are smooth and free from sharp or jagged elements, consistent with design principles that favor roundedness for depicting cute or juvenile characters. Therefore, the edges align well with the intended visual style.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon baby elephant is depicted sitting with its legs folded, trunk lifted, and a cheerful expression, which is a pose often used to depict playful and approachable characters in cartoons.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'First Splash!' and 'Ele-Baby' in Image B is centrally aligned above and below the cartoon elephant. It is clear, easy to read, and well-positioned, contributing to a harmonious visual balance without clashing with the central image of the elephant. The placement on a transparent background allows the text to stand out without any disruptions to other visual elements.",
