      "question": "Does the entire body of the gorilla exhibit consistent wood texture and shading, with no sudden color changes or patches that appear non-wood-like?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual cues in the edited image, the gorilla's body is crafted in a wooden texture with consistent coloration and shading throughout. There are no noticeable abrupt color shifts or patches that would suggest a deviation from wood texture. The uniformity of the material suggests careful craftsmanship that maintains the wooden theme across the sculpture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the engraved fur patterns on the gorilla's body varied in depth and direction, resembling natural wood grain rather than repetitive or synthetic lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gorilla in the edited image shows fur patterns that reflect natural variations in the wood grain. The depth and direction of these engravings vary, mimicking the irregularities found in natural fur. This prevents them from appearing repetitive or synthetic, adding authenticity to the wooden representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arms and legs retain anatomically correct proportions and joint structures, with no flattened or unnaturally curved sections due to excessive smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the gorilla with anatomically correct proportions and joint structures. The arms and legs maintain their natural curvature and articulation without any flattening or irregular shaping. Despite the transformation into wood, the anatomical correctness is preserved, providing a realistic representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of etched wood patterns with darker leaf shapes integrated into it, maintaining depth and layering without appearing flat or disjointed from the gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the edited image features etched wood patterns that incorporate darker leaf shapes. These elements are integrated in a way that retains depth and layering, creating a cohesive scene with the gorilla. The leaves and patterns do not appear flat or disjointed, enhancing the sense of continuity in the wooden artwork.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scattered leaves in the background rendered in darker wood tones and placed in positions that suggest natural resting or embedding into the wooden surface, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the scattered leaves are depicted in darker wood tones and are strategically placed to suggest a natural arrangement. This positioning implies they are resting or embedded into the wooden surface rather than floating or improperly overlapping. The thoughtful placement reinforces the integrity of the wooden sculpture.",
