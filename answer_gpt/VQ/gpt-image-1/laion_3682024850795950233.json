      "question": "Does the bread slice retain a natural crumb texture and crust edge without visible smoothing or unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bread slice cartoon character is designed with details typical of a simplified illustration style, which inherently lacks the natural crumb texture found in real bread. The edges are smooth and lack the irregularity of authentic crust. Thus, in this context, the bread is depicted without natural crumb texture and with some degree of simplification to enhance the character design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial features positioned within the bread slice and aligned with its surface plane, without appearing detached or floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B are designed to be part of the bread warrior character, and they are aligned on the surface plane of the bread slice, maintaining their position coherently with the character's design. They do not appear to be floating or detached, suggesting a carefully integrated design within the two-dimensional plane of the illustration.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the lettuce leaves forming the cape show consistent leaf texture and natural curling, without flat or uniformly colored sections suggesting loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lettuce leaves are drawn in a stylized manner, typical of cartoon or comic illustrations. While they are not photorealistic, the leaves exhibit a sense of curling and slight variation in edge to indicate texture. However, due to the nature of the illustration style, some areas might appear more uniformly colored or flat, yet this suits the artistic approach.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the hand-drawn illustrations in the timeline clearly defined with uniform stroke thickness and no visible pixelation or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The timeline illustrations in Image B are part of a cartoon style design. They appear to have consistent line work with uniform thickness and no apparent pixelation or broken lines, which are typical traits of well-executed digital illustrations. This ensures clarity and coherency in the visual storytelling of the bread warrior's journey.",

      "question": "Are all circular icons perfectly round with smooth edges and consistent fill color, without any jaggedness or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular icons in Image B are a part of a clean, digitally-created illustration style, showing smooth edges, and consistent fill colors. They do not exhibit jaggedness or irregularities, maintaining the aesthetic quality expected in digital design work, suitable for clear and effective communication of ideas.",
