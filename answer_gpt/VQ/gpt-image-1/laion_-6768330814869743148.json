      "question": "Do the pastries in the edited image maintain their original shapes without distorted or stretched forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries are abstracted into more stylized shapes using bold colors and distinct outlines. However, the fundamental shapes of the pastries, such as the round cookies, circular galettes, and muffin-like baked goods maintain a proportional and recognizable form, without appearing distorted or stretched beyond stylization. The visual cues, such as circular shapes for the cookies and muffins, remain consistent with typical pastry forms, indicating that despite the artistic flair, the shapes are retained.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bread slices' internal textures clearly visible and consistent with real bread, or do they appear overly stylized with uniform patterns that lack natural variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bread slices are depicted with an artistic geometric pattern rather than showing realistic textures. Real bread typically exhibits a variety of textures and pores due to its natural baking process. The edited image adopts a uniform color and pattern approach, which is an overly stylized representation lacking the natural, irregular textures seen in actual bread.",

      "question": "Do the muffin liners show clear geometric patterns that still align with the shape of the muffins and do not float or detach from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the muffin liners with a geometric checkerboard pattern that effectively wraps around the muffins, following their contours. The visual distinction between the muffins and their liners is maintained without any indication of floating or detachment, ensuring the pattern complements rather than conflicts with the muffins' shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the checkerboard pattern applied uniformly across the tray surfaces without breaking the perceived depth or causing unnatural flatness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trays are designed with a consistent checkerboard pattern that gives the impression of both surface decoration and structural balance. While the pattern is abstract, it does not create awkward depth illusions, maintaining a sense of three-dimensionality as seen in the original display. The pattern both decorates and enhances the designed space without causing flatness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the abstract shapes in the background positioned in a way that matches the depth and alignment of the original cup stack, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses bold, abstract shapes and colors in the background, which introduce a different artistic interpretation. The original cup stack in Image A was logical in alignment and depth. In the edited image, the abstraction of abstract shapes does not attempt to mimically replicate the cupsâ€™ depth perception but instead opts for an expressionistic approach that doesn't correctly match the original geometric alignment and positioning of the cups, which may suggest floating or misalignment.",
