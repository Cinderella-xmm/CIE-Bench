    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed building retain consistent geometric proportions and smooth surface transitions, with no visible warping or broken edges in its armored body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the building is transformed into a robotic structure with an armored body. When evaluating its geometric proportions, we observe that the edits maintain smooth surface transitions throughout the robotic body's design, showing coherence and precision in structure without warping or breaking lines at joints or curves. Visually, the robotic outline appears professionally integrated without distortion issues.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the stylized shoulder pads seamlessly integrated into the roofline, with clean, sharp edges and coherent patterns that do not appear stretched or fragmented?",
    "explanation": "The shoulder pads in Image B are embedded into the building's structure, specifically on the roofline, creating a seamless visual transition from traditional architecture to futuristic elements. The patterns on these pads maintain sharp and coherent detailing, without any stretching or fragmentation viewed along their edges, highlighting a successful integration of disparate designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Do the replaced traffic signs display clear holographic effects (e.g., soft glow, transparency) without causing light leaks or unnatural color shifts in adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the traffic signs are rendered with holographic effects displaying distinct features like soft glows and transparency, which are evident from their luminescent appearance. These effects are localized, avoiding undesirable light leaks or color shifts that could disrupt adjacent visual areas, contributing to an overall balanced holographic display.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the robotic pedestrians have correctly proportioned limbs with five fingers per hand, and do their joints and body shapes follow geometric logic without unnatural bending or missing segments?",
    "explanation": "The robotic pedestrians in Image B maintain correct body proportion and articulate limb structure, with limbs aligned to a geometric logic that mirrors human anatomy. Each hand is crafted with five fingers, consistent with common humanoid robotic designs, and the joints and body flow without any visual errors or missing segments, showcasing meticulous attention to robotic anthropomorphism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are shadows cast by the robotic pedestrians and the transformed building consistent with the direction of sunlight from the top-left, and do they align naturally with surrounding objects?",
    "explanation": "Given the lighting in Image B from the top-left direction, the shadows produced by the robotic pedestrians and the transformed building follow this directional cue. They harmonize naturally with the rest of the scene, positioning and aligning accurately with the surrounding environment, ensuring consistency and realism in shadow placement that mirrors the light source.",
    "answer": "Yes"
