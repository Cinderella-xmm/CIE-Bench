    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the olive and dark green LEGO bricks covering the tank's body uniformly aligned and textured, without visible gaps, misaligned blocks, or distorted shapes that break the geometric structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks appear to be neatly aligned and assembled to cover the tank's body uniformly. The blocks are placed in a way that maintains a smooth and even surface without noticeable gaps or misalignments, which is expected in properly built LEGO creations. The lack of distorted shapes that could break the geometric structure indicates attention to detail and precision in assembly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the colorful LEGO tiger pattern on the front hull maintain the correct proportions and facial features of the original tiger decal, without distortion or missing elements such as eyes, teeth, or stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO tiger pattern on Image B accurately replicates the original tiger design found in Image A. It recreates the proportions and facial features such as eyes, teeth, and stripes, indicating a careful attempt to mirror the original design. The vibrant colors and pattern structure are consistent with the original, suggesting no distortions or missing elements.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the LEGO treads exhibit consistent, detailed texture resembling real tank tracks, with no flattened sections or incorrect spacing between the individual tread segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO treads are designed to replicate the detailed texture of real tank tracks. The segments appear evenly spaced and maintain a consistent, realistic appearance. There are no visible flattened sections or incorrect spacing, which would otherwise detract from the authenticity of the track representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO tank fully supported by a smooth, continuous wooden platform that matches the surrounding ground level, with no floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO tank in Image B appears to be placed on a smooth, flat wooden platform that matches the surrounding LEGO ground level. There are no visibly floating edges or misalignments, suggesting the platform is designed to provide stable support, replicating the setup in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the green LEGO brick back panel blend seamlessly with the surrounding environment, showing no sharp edges, unnatural color shifts, or textural inconsistencies compared to the real foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a LEGO brick back panel intended to mimic the natural foliage background seen in Image A. While the LEGO bricks provide a uniform green surface, their texture and sharp edges are characteristic of LEGO, inherently contrasting with the irregular texture and color variations of real foliage. This disparity results in noticeable differences, such as sharpness and consistency, when blending with a natural environment.",
