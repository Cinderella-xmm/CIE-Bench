    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the character’s head appear significantly larger than the body while maintaining smooth contours and proper alignment of limbs and torso without visible stretching or tearing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's head is illustrated in a cartoonish style, which is typical for such representations, making it larger than the body. The contours of the character are smooth, and the limbs and torso appear well-aligned, showing no signs of visible stretching or tearing. This style is consistent with common chibi or caricature art, where disproportionate features are intentional for visual appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the character’s suit evenly distributed, free from repeating tiles or jagged edges, and do they follow a logical direction consistent with fabric draping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns on the suit in Image B are designed in vibrant colors, featuring swirls that are evenly placed across the fabric. These patterns follow the character's body contours and simulate the draping effect, common in cartoon art, without showing repeating tiles or jagged edges, indicating a coherent design consistent with fabric distribution.",

      "question": "Are the oversized glasses fully rendered with clear lenses and frames, aligned with the eye region, and without partial transparency or clipping against facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts oversized glasses that are stylistically aligned with the eye region as expected in cartoon designs. The frames and lenses appear fully rendered without transparency issues or clipping against facial features, which is typical in stylized illustrations.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s hand is illustrated with five fingers showing natural curvature and spacing. This style reflects the typical representation in cartoon art, and there are no distorted knuckles, extra digits, or unnatural shadowing visible in the hand's depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the abstract skyscrapers and balloons positioned at plausible distances, casting soft shadows, and aligned with the character’s perspective without floating above ground or appearing detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features abstract skyscrapers and balloons positioned appropriately in relation to the character's perspective. They are arranged at distances that suggest depth and avoid appearing detached or floating. While abstract, their positioning is consistent with the scene, providing cohesive visual harmony.",
