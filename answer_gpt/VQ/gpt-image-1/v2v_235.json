      "question": "Does the 3D chibi rendition of the dancer maintain natural proportions without introducing any unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is rendered in a chibi style that deliberately exaggerates certain features, typical of this art style. The head is disproportionately large compared to the body, and the limbs, while shaped like a human's, maintain rounded and simplified forms characteristic of chibi art. These choices are stylistic and intentionally deviate from natural human proportions. Thus, the style is consistent within its domain, but it does entail geometric distortions relative to realistic proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glowing elliptical portal visually credible, with no obvious artifacts where it meets the realistic dance studio environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portal appears as a glowing ellipse transitioning seamlessly into the dance environment. Its glow suggests an intentional design choice and incorporates lighting effects that harmonize with the surrounding scene, without apparent visual artifacts at the juncture between the portal and the studio.",

      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dancer's hand extending towards the viewer retain natural textures and details, with no more than five fingers visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi dancer's hand reaches toward the viewer, displaying accurate human hand anatomy. It maintains natural textures, appropriate layering of shadows and highlights, and clearly presents five fingers, consistent with realistic human anatomy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the spotlight effects in the grayscale 3D chibi world consistent with the dancer's pose, contributing to a natural and visually plausible scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is not grayscale but rather in full color. Therefore, the spotlight effects are evaluated based on the lighting used around the portal and studio environment. The lighting highlights the dancer's form and pose in a manner consistent with the environment, contributing to a plausible scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition adhere to the 2:3 aspect ratio, with the dancer and portal positioned in a balanced manner that enhances visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a composition where the dancer and portal are centrally positioned, aligning with a vertically oriented stage, compatible with a 2:3 aspect ratio. The dancer's pose and the portal placement contribute to a balanced composition that retains visual credibility.",
