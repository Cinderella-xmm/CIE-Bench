      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the transformed peaks retain their original height and angularity without appearing stretched, bent, or misaligned compared to the base of the mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a large creature with horns and a distinct mossy texture rather than natural mountain peaks. This new object replaces the landscape in Image A. The creature's features, such as its horns and shoulders, are prominent and do not resemble the natural peaks of mountains. This transformation causes the original mountain peaks to be altered and replaced, indicating a change in structure. Thus, the original height and angularity are not retained, suggesting misalignment and alteration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textured hide patterns on the mountain slopes smooth and consistent with natural rock formations, without repeating tile-like patterns or sharp edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creatureâ€™s skin is mossy and textured, signifying a shift from the natural rock formations seen in Image A. While the texture is rich and detailed, it resembles a creature's hide rather than a mountain slope, which means it may not closely mimic typical geological patterns. However, the image does not exhibit tile-like patterns or obvious digital artifacts, but the organic pattern of the creature's texture deviates significantly from the smoothness of natural rock formations.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the mossy patches and root-like strands extend naturally from existing vegetation zones and follow downhill gradients without floating above the ground or forming unnatural clusters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature incorporated into the landscape has a distinctly moss-covered appearance with root-like patterns. These features are part of the creature's design rather than naturally occurring elements extending from vegetation zones. While they are convincingly integrated into the creature's surface and mimic natural textures, they do not stem from original vegetation formations or follow typical geographical gradients as seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the sinewy musculature in the valley area follow the natural curve of the depression and connect smoothly to adjacent slopes without creating disjointed or exaggerated protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the muscular form of the creature replaces the valley in Image A. The contours of the musculature flow naturally across the creature's form, aligning with its design rather than any pre-existing valley curves. While easily distinguishable and artistically crafted, these forms substitute the valley structure, thus creating new curves and forms. This leads to some departure from the original landscape's smooth transition between slopes and valleys.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the transformed elements (hide, fur, musculature) within the same tonal range as the original landscape, with no sudden shifts in hue or brightness that disrupt visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature has a predominantly green, brown, and earthy palette, which blends well with the overall environment reminiscent of the natural hues found in landscapes, as seen in Image A. Despite the change in textures, the colors are consistent with what might be expected in a natural setting, and there are no unnatural shifts in color or brightness that would disrupt visual coherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are small-scale details like erosion lines, grass tufts, and rock crevices still visible and correctly aligned with the terrain, without blurring, duplication, or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the introduction of the creature significantly alters the visible details compared to Image A. The focus is on the creature's textured surface, which does not preserve small details such as erosion lines, grass tufts, or rock crevices from the original landscape. As result, these natural terrain elements have been overshadowed by the creature's features, potentially losing alignment with the terrain and presenting a new focus. This suggests that many of these details are altered or missing.",
