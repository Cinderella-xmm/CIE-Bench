    "Question": "Q1: Do the transformed columns resemble organic wooden legs with natural joint angles and proportional thickness, without visible distortion or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the columns of the structure are transformed into organic shapes that mimic tree roots with natural contours. The curvature and joints appear consistent with the form of large tree branches and roots, exhibiting variation in thickness that one would expect in nature. They are free from any abrupt deformities or unrealistic shapes that would suggest an unnatural or broken geometry.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Does the roof area show a gradual transition from straw-like material to leafy branches with realistic leaf shapes, spacing, and lighting interaction, without jagged edges or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "Image B's top region portrays the roof area with a progression from straw material to leafy branches. The leaves are shaped consistently and there is no sign of jagged edges or textures that appear out of place. The lighting interplay with the leaves appears natural, with appropriate shading and highlights that suggest a smooth texture and natural spacing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the satellite dish replaced by a large, detailed eye with a visible iris and pupil, positioned naturally on the side of the structure, without floating elements or mismatched shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the satellite dish is swapped with a large eye. The eye possesses a clear and detailed iris and pupil, giving it a lifelike appearance. It is seamlessly integrated into the center of the tree-like structure, suggesting an intrinsic part of the form rather than something externally attached. The consistency in shading aligns well with its placement, avoiding any dissonance in lighting that would otherwise indicate it being a separate or floating element.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the wall surfaces covered with detailed bark patterns showing natural cracks, ridges, and color gradients, without repeating textures or uniformity indicating artificial generation?",
    "explanation": "The surface of Image B is adorned with detailed bark patterns. These patterns show natural features such as varied cracks and ridges seen in natural tree bark and exhibit variations in color, which mirrors the irregularities found in nature. The irregular presentations and non-repetitive patterns prevent any indication of artificial or repeated generation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the orange blossoms emit a faint, diffused glow that blends with ambient lighting, without sharp halos or unnatural brightness that separates them from the surrounding environment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the orange blossoms are depicted with a soft glow that integrates smoothly into the ambient lighting environment without creating abrupt or artificial halos. The subtle brightness appears uniform and does not sharply contrast against the surrounding area, which would otherwise separate it visually.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the vines emerge from multiple points on the structure, hang downward with natural curvature and density variation, and interact realistically with light and shadows?",
    "explanation": "The depiction of vines in Image B shows them emanating from various areas on the framework, draping down in naturally varying densities. Their form bends gently and follows realistic curves typical of hanging vines, and their interaction with light and shadows reflects a believable integration into the scene, enhancing the perception of a natural growth pattern.",
    "answer": "Yes"
