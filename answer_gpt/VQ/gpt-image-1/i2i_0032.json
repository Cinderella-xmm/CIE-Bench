      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style illustrations are cartoonish and have a consistent appearance throughout the image.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi-style characters are designed to have exaggerated proportions, like larger heads and smaller bodies, which are consistent in the illustrations shown. Their proportional features are uniform and align with the standard chibi artistic style. Given that the image's context is illustrative, thereâ€™s no distortion or inconsistency in their design.",

These illustrations harmonize well within the thematic context, not introducing jarring elements.",
