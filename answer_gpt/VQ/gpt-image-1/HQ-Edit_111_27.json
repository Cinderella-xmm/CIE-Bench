      "question": "Does the geisha's face retain anatomical accuracy with natural proportions and smooth contours despite the stained glass transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained glass effect introduces angularity and segmentations typical of this artistic style, likely leading to alterations in anatomical features. The stained glass technique is characterized by bold outlines and fragmented shapes, diverging from smooth and natural contours, thus typically affecting anatomical accuracy.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the kimono composed of distinct, sharp segments resembling leaded glass, with no blurred edges or unnatural blending between colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits the stained glass style where the kimono patterns have distinct segments outlined by lead lines, which is typical of stained glass art. These segments are sharp with well-defined borders and show no signs of blurred edges or blending, thus reflecting the characteristics of stained glass design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cherry blossoms exhibit uniform glass-like textures with clear outlines and internal color gradations typical of stained glass, without appearing mushy or pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms are rendered with clear outlines and exhibit an internal gradient in color that is characteristic of stained glass artworks. They maintain a consistent texture and appearance typical of stained glass, avoiding mushy or pixelated visual aberrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the peacock fan have a logical number of feather segments arranged symmetrically around a central spine, with no overlapping or misaligned parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the fan where the feather segments are aligned symmetrically around a central spine, showing a logical arrangement typical of peacock feathers. The stained glass style supports this symmetrical and ordered structure without overlaps or misalignments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the background lines smoothly curved and interconnected without abrupt breaks, gaps, or inconsistent thicknesses that suggest rendering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background lines in Image B are smoothly curved and interconnected, consistent with ornamental stained glass style, exhibiting no abrupt breaks or gaps. Their thickness remains consistent, lacking any rendering artifacts, which is expected in high-quality stained glass representations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the fan display five clearly defined fingers with proper ergonomics and no extra digits or fused joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the fan is depicted with clearly defined fingers. The stained glass segmentation helps in outlining the fingers with distinct separations and ergonomics, ensuring no extra digits or fused joints are present as would be visible in the stained glass style.",
