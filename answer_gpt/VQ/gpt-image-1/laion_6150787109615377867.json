      "question": "Does the gear surface on the tabletop show consistent metallic sheen and detailed engravings without blurred or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop resembles a gear with a metallic appearance. The surface displays an intricate design with detailed engravings, consistent with what is expected from a well-crafted gear. These engravings are clear, without any visible blurring or jagged edges, indicating a high-quality render of a metallic surface.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the piston-driven limbs symmetrically arranged and proportionally scaled to the central column, with clearly defined joints and no bent or broken segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the object feature a steampunk aesthetic, with piston-driven mechanics. These limbs are symmetrically positioned around the central column, showing an even distribution and proportionate scaling. Each limb has precisely defined joints, and there are no visible signs of bending or breaking, suggesting a careful and deliberate design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the steam vents evenly spaced along the central column and properly embedded into the metal surface without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts steam vents that are part of the central column. They are evenly spaced, enhancing the symmetrical appearance of the design. These vents are properly embedded within the structure of the column, seamlessly integrated without any indication of detachment or misalignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cog patterns and dials on the base have intact geometric shapes with uniform spacing and no overlapping or incomplete features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the object in Image B functions as a detailed depiction of gears and mechanical components. These elements are characterized by clear geometric shapes, maintaining uniform spacing. There is no evidence of overlapping or incomplete features, indicating precision in the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brass and copper accents clearly differentiated from the silver metal by color and reflectivity, without unnatural gradients or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the metallic components are differentiated by color. The brass and copper accents are distinct from each other and from any silver-colored elements. The different metals are separated by their characteristic reflectivity and hue, without any unnatural gradients or texture issues, demonstrating a clear and deliberate contrast.",
