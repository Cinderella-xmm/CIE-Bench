    "Question": "Q1: Are the mountain shapes simplified into clear geometric forms without distorted edges or irregular facets that break their structural consistency?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are depicted using strong geometric shapes with well-defined lines and angles. This stylization involves reducing complex natural forms into simple geometric shapes such as triangles and sharp lines, which are characteristic of abstract or modern art. There are no visual cues suggesting distorted edges or irregularities, leading to the conclusion that the mountains are consistently depicted in this simplified, stylized manner.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the trees retain recognizable silhouettes with consistent geometric proportions and smooth outlines, avoiding fragmented or misshapen branches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are represented using simplistic geometric shapes and silhouettes. The trees are formed using circular and oval shapes and are symmetrically aligned, which means they do not have fragmented or misshapen branches. This graphical representation emphasizes consistency in proportions and smooth outlines, akin to a stylized art form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the radiating parallel lines in the river aligned with its natural flow direction and spaced uniformly to maintain visual continuity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the river is depicted with radiating parallel lines that extend from the horizon to the foreground. These lines are designed to mimic the natural flow direction of the river and are spaced uniformly, creating a sense of continuity and movement. The alignment and even spacing of the lines contribute to a visually harmonious and consistent presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the reflection in the river perfectly symmetrical to the elements above it, with matching shapes and positions of trees and mountains?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a clear and consistent symmetrical reflection in the river. The reflection mirrors the shapes and positions of surrounding elements, such as trees and mountains, ensuring they are perfectly symmetrical. This symmetry is a crucial aspect of such stylized art, where maintaining visual balance and coherence is key.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the color block boundaries crisp and clean, with no visible blurring, feathering, or pixelation at the edges of geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boundaries between different color blocks are sharp and distinct. The image uses clean lines to separate colors, which creates a smooth and polished appearance. There is no evidence of blurring, feathering, or pixelation along the edges of the geometric shapes, which is typical for vector-style art that emphasizes neat and precise lines.",
    "answer": "Yes"
