      "question": "Does the outer box retain the rich mahogany color and wood grain texture that matches the original clock's frame, without unnatural shifts in tone or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wooden box with ornate carvings that resemble a classic mahogany style. Comparing it to Image A, which features a similar decorative wooden frame around a clock, we can see that the rich mahogany color and wood grain texture have been preserved in both images. Common sense tells us that mahogany typically has a rich, dark color with a smooth texture, and this is consistent across both the edited box and the original clock frame.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the modern watch positioned centrally within the box, with its face size and numeral style proportionally consistent with the original clock’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a watch positioned centrally within a box. The watch face features Roman numerals and a design style similar to the clock in Image A. Considering the proportions, the watch face appears smaller in relation to its box compared to the clock face's relation to its frame, but the numeral style remains consistent as both use Roman numerals following a classic design style. This visual cue combined with the world knowledge of Roman numeral styles supports proportional consistency.",

      "question": "Does the interior lining appear as a continuous, seamless velvet surface with no visible artifacts, tears, or irregularities in texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior lining of the box looks smooth and continuous, with a texture that is consistent with high-quality velvet. There are no visible artifacts, tears, or irregularities in texture. Combining this visual observation with world knowledge about velvet's finish and texture, we can affirm that the interior lining does indeed appear seamless and of good quality.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the engraved plaque positioned directly below the watch, flush with the base of the box, and does it display clear, non-distorted text or markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an engraved plaque positioned below the watch inside the box. Observing the visual cues, the plaque is flush with the base, and the engraving appears clear with readable text. Engravings typically require precision, which is visually confirmed here with non-distorted markings, supported by world knowledge of typical engraving clarity and positioning within display cases.",

      "question": "Are the baroque decorative elements on the box fully detailed and three-dimensionally rendered, with consistent lighting and shadowing that match the original clock’s relief?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays detailed baroque elements on the box's outer frame. These are visually three-dimensional and rendered with attention to detail. Comparing this to Image A, the baroque decorations have a similar style with detailed carvings and consistent lighting that highlights the depth, matching the original clock’s relief. Through the visual examination of shadowing and detailing coupled with knowledge of baroque styling, we confirm the consistent rendering.",
