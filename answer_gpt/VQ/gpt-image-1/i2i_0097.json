      "question": "Does the addition of the text “Master Chef” and “Final Round” appear naturally integrated without disrupting the overall visual balance of the plate and spoon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Master Chef' and 'Final Round' are positioned respectively above and below the plate with spoon. The choice of the text size and placement is carefully made so that it frames the central image without overwhelming it. The text is evenly spaced with the top and bottom sections, adding emphasis to the central elements while balancing the composition effectively. This shows an understanding of design principles where text elements can lead the viewer's eyes towards the focal point, the plate and spoon, without causing a visual imbalance.",

      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts or unnatural textures introduced in the image due to the text overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon visual inspection of Image B, the overlay of the text 'Master Chef' and 'Final Round' does not introduce any visible artifacts or disruption in textures. The text blends smoothly with the background and the plate environment, showing no irregularities or mismatches. This indicates careful text application ensuring that clarity and quality are preserved, which is key in maintaining visual integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the text sizes for “Master Chef” and “Final Round” seem proportional and appropriate compared to the scale of the plate and spoon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text sizes are chosen such that both 'Master Chef' and 'Final Round' are dominant enough to draw attention yet are not so large as to overshadow the central plate image. The sizes are proportional, maintaining a scaled hierarchy that respects the presence of the central image - the plate and spoon. A balanced proportion between graphic elements helps maintain visual harmony within the design.",

      "question": "Does the font style chosen for “Master Chef” and “Final Round” complement the simplicity of the white plate and silver spoon, maintaining visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the font style used for 'Master Chef' and 'Final Round' is bold and sans-serif, which complements the straightforward and clean aesthetic of the white plate and silver spoon. The simplicity of the font combined with its clear readability works within the theme, enhancing rather than detracting from the elegant simplicity of the central elements, thereby maintaining visual harmony and credibility.",

      "question": "Has the circular shape of the plate remained intact and undistorted despite the addition of the text elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A with Image B, the circular shape of the plate has remained perfectly intact in Image B. The addition of the text elements around the circle does not cause any distortion or warping to the circular geometry of the plate. The plate's shape is unchanged, showing the editor's focus on maintaining structural integrity amidst the overlay of new design elements.",
