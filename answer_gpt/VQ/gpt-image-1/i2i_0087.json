      "question": "Are the shadows under and around the protruding clock consistent with its new 3D effect without creating artificial or inconsistent lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock has been given a 3D protruding effect, and shadows are present under and around it. The shadows appear to properly align with the lighting as they extend towards the right side and downward, consistent with a light source coming from the top left. This aligns with common expectations of how light falls and creates shadows when interacting with protruding objects, which adds to the credibility of the 3D effect without any inconsistencies in the lighting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the circular shape of the clock remain undistorted and geometrically sound after being altered to appear as if it protrudes from the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clock with a 3D effect, making it protrude from the wall. The circular frame of the clock appears to have a consistent, symmetrical shape without any visible distortions. Typically, altering a shape to add depth can lead to deformations if not done precisely; however, in this case, the circle remains geometrically sound, maintaining its uniform roundness.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the textures and fine details on the clock face been preserved, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or pixelation as a result of making it appear 3D?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face appears smooth and even, with no visible signs of artifacts or pixelation despite having been modified to create a 3D effect. The face of the clock remains clear, suggesting careful attention was given to preserve quality while enhancing the depth. This indicates that high-resolution techniques were likely used when rendering the edited elements.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the clock's hands and markings retain their original clarity, style, and proportion, contributing to a natural and credible appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the clock's hands and markings are sharp, well-defined, and consistent with their original design. They maintain their proportions and appear in the correct style, which is crucial for maintaining realism when emphasizing a 3D aspect. This suggests a non-disruptive transformation where attention to detail is retained, preserving a credible appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited clock appear to naturally integrate into the wall with a realistic thickness and depth, maintaining visual plausibility within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the clock is rendered with a noticeable thickness, providing it with a realistic 3D form that seems naturally affixed to the wall. The design of the clock and the shadows cast contribute to establishing depth, achieving a look that integrates seamlessly with the scene while maintaining a realistic thickness appropriate for wall-mounted clocks.",
