      "question": "Are the enlarged head of the boy and the shrunken birds proportionate and structurally coherent, avoiding any noticeable distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the boy's head and the birds appear exaggerated and stylized, fitting the typical 'cartoonish' or 'sticker-like' theme. This is a common design choice to create a playful and engaging visual rather than an anatomically accurate one. The head is noticeably larger relative to the body and the birds, in line with the intended art style, which does not necessarily follow natural proportions. Therefore, no distortion is perceived within this stylistic context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the block colors used for the boy's skin tone and feather textures appear clean and uniform, without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes flat, solid colors for various elements, including the boy's skin and the birds' feathers, which is consistent with a simplified, graphic aesthetic typical of digital illustrations and decals. These block colors are smoothly applied and appear clean without any unintended texture or artifacts, achieving the desired uniformity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the white outlines around the boy and birds smooth and consistent, without jagged edges or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white outlines surrounding the boy and the birds in Image B are consistent with digital illustration techniques. These outlines are smooth and continuous, providing a defined border around each element without exhibiting any jagged edges or breaks. This contributes to a polished and completed appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shrunken birds retain their fine details and textures naturally, without losing clarity or appearing pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the birds are depicted in a simplified, block-color style typical of cartoon illustrations, this style intentionally omits fine details for artistic effect. However, within this style, the birds' features are clear and discernible without any pixelation, indicating that the intended level of clarity is maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition with the enlarged boy's head and shrunken birds appear balanced and neatly arranged, providing visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an artistically balanced composition, strategically placing the boy's enlarged head centrally with the birds positioned around it. This arrangement is typical in styles that aim for charm and appeal rather than realistic depiction. The placement and arrangement maintain a sense of order and balance, which upholds visual credibility in the context of its artistic style.",
