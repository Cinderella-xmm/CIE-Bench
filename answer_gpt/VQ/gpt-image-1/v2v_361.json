      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain of the dog appear naturally integrated into the image without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a chibi-style keychain being held by a hand, and the focus is on the seamless integration of this keychain into the image. The keychain is clearly defined, and its cartoon-style design is straightforward without visible artifacts. The contrast between different elements in the image, such as the hand's texture and the keychain's smooth finish, is distinct but not suggestive of integration issues. Thus, the keychain appears to be naturally part of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi-style keychain consistent with the hand holding it, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the proportions of the chibi-style keychain relative to the fingers are coherent, suggesting a common hand-held size for keychains. The keychain fits naturally between the thumb and forefinger, appearing proportional and consistent with the hand's grasp. The design avoids any visible deformations, maintaining rational physical dimensions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain accurately depict the dog's essential features and characteristics from the original image, maintaining visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the chibi-style keychain represents a dog with exaggerated cartoon features typical of chibi design. The original image showcases a Yorkshire Terrier with long hair and defining features such as its ears and facial hair. The keychain captures these essential traits but in a simplified and stylized manner fitting the chibi form. While it does not replicate the realism, it maintains the playful essence typical in such representations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the texture and fine details of the chibi-style keychain preserved and look natural, without any loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts a smooth, cartoon-style keychain where the focus is not on fine details or realistic textures but rather on the bold, defining outlines and colors of the chibi design. The choice to have a simplistic and clean texture is consistent with the chibi art style. Therefore, any perception of 'loss of detail' is intentional and characteristic of such designs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the connection between the chibi-style keychain and the tiny silver keyring appear natural and physically plausible, without any structural inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the keychain attached to a keyring. This connection appears sturdy and natural, as the keychain is attached to a small metal loop at the top, which is visibly integrated into the structure of the keychain itself. There are no apparent inconsistencies or unrealistic gaps at the junction between the keyring and keychain, contributing to a cohesive and credible appearance.",
