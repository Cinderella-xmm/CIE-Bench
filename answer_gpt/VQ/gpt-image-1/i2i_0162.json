      "question": "Does the mouse's fur texture appear smooth and maintain the natural look expected in a Pixar-style animation without unnatural or overly simplified patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse's fur is smooth and appears stylized in a way typical of Pixar-style animations. This style often emphasizes smooth transitions, rounded forms, and a slight gloss that enhances the cuteness and animation appeal. The fur does not show any overly simplified or geometric patterns that would disrupt this aesthetic, giving it a natural yet stylized appearance, consistent with the Pixar style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mouse's ears, eyes, and whiskers proportionally correct and not distorted relative to its body size in the Pixar animation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse's ears and eyes are exaggerated in size, which is a characteristic feature of Pixar animations aimed at creating an emotive and engaging character. The whiskers appear long and delicate, fitting well with the animated style. The proportions are intentionally stylized but fit the character's overall design, preserving the whimsical and endearing qualities typical of this genre.",

      "question": "Do the soft shadows under the mouse and surrounding crumbs appear naturally integrated into the scene without any harsh or misplaced artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows underneath the mouse and the crumbs are soft and diffuse, enhancing the realism of the lighting. These shadows are consistent with a unified light source, blending seamlessly into the overall scene without harsh edges or noticeable artifacts. This natural integration contributes to a cohesive and believable animated environment.",

      "question": "Does the floor's texture retain sufficient detail and pattern authenticity in the Pixar animation style, avoiding unnatural smoothing or artificial patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor texture is stylized yet detailed enough to be recognizable as a tiled surface. Pixar animation style often simplifies real-world textures while maintaining identifiable patterns and elements. The tiled floor here appears clean and polished but retains enough detail to avoid appearing overly artificial or smoothed out, consistent with Pixar styling principles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crumbs' sizes and shapes consistent and believable within the context of the image, without displaying any unnatural irregularities or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crumbs scattered around the mouse are varied in size and shape, but they consistently display the randomized yet natural distribution typical of crumbs. Their appearance is consistent and believable within the Pixar context, as animations often stylize objects to suit the scene's narrative without losing realism. The lack of unnatural irregularities or distortions suggests attention to detail in their design.",
