      "question": "Do the superhero costumes on all five individuals have consistent fabric textures and realistic draping that follow the contours of their bodies without unnatural stretching or folding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the superhero costumes are drawn in a cartoon style, which typically features exaggerated and smooth surfaces without intricate fabric textures. The costumes appear uniformly green and blue, which is consistent with the comic style that prioritizes flat colors over realistic textures. The draping seems appropriate for the style, focusing more on contours and outlines than on realistic fabric behavior.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the hands holding the Daffodil Power Passes positioned naturally with five fingers visible per hand, appropriate grip pressure, and no signs of clipping or floating objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, cartoon-style illustrations often simplify hand shapes and proportions. Therefore, in the edited image, the hands might not depict all five fingers distinctly, and the grip might look stylized rather than natural. The hands holding the passes show limited detail due to stylistic choice, which is typical in graphic images aiming for clarity and simplicity rather than realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the poses of the five individuals physically plausible, with joints aligned naturally and no bent limbs or disproportionate body segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the poses of the individuals are exaggerated in a comic style, which may sometimes distort natural anatomy for effect or humor. The characters are depicted with confident and bold stances associated with superhero themes, which might not align with realistic depictions of human anatomy. These poses focus more on expressing character traits than adhering strictly to physical plausibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dialogue bubbles positioned above or near the heads of the individuals without overlapping eyes or mouths, and do they display legible text with clean edges and no visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dialogue bubbles are a standard feature in comics, positioned near speakers to maintain clarity. These bubbles do not overlap faces and display clean text, ensuring readability. The visual team ensures that bubbles are well-integrated with the composition, leaving no visual interference like eyes or mouths overlapping with the bubbles, maintaining clear communication within the comic panels.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the enhanced garden background visually coherent with the original scene, featuring consistent lighting, natural flower arrangements, and no abrupt color shifts or artificial-looking textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cartoon-style background with simplified lines and colors, typical in comics, which differ from realistic imagery. The garden features daffodils and other elements but maintains a stylized appearance without detailed textures. While there is consistency in theme and color usage, cartoon images often use bold, flat colors, which may come across as artificial when compared to photographic backgrounds.",
