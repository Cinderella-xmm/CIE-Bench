      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cathedral fa√ßade maintain detailed textures and depth consistent with the original stone structure, or does it appear uniformly smooth and plastic-like due to the resin material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the cathedral within a resin framework, which offers a meticulously detailed representation of the structure. The editing maintains the intricate architectural details, such as the stone textures and ornate carvings evident in the original cathedral, suggesting added depth and realism. This meticulous depiction aligns with resin's ability to capture fine details, contrasting with a more plastic-like appearance that would present lower detail or smoothness.",

      "question": "Are the added miniature figures proportionally scaled and positioned so they appear naturally smaller than the cathedral and surrounding buildings without appearing stretched, flattened, or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature figures are shown proportionally scaled relative to the cathedral's grand architecture. They are strategically positioned to enhance realism, representing typical human interaction with such a structure. The figures do not appear distorted or misaligned, which indicates thoughtful scaling and positioning.",

      "question": "Do the miniature lamps emit soft, localized light that appears consistent with their size and placement, without creating unrealistic glows or illuminating areas that should remain in shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes miniature lamps that emit a light consistent with their scale. The localized light softly illuminates the immediate surroundings of each lamp, forming a realistic effect without causing excessive brightness or eliminating shadows essential for depth. The careful attenuation of light highlights thoughtful editing.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display case in Image B surrounds the cathedral and square with a well-integrated and seamless design. Its edges are continuous, harmonious with the structure, and do not disrupt the geometry of the cathedral or associated buildings, implying skilful integration.",
