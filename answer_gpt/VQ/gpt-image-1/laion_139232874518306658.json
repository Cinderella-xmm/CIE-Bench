      "question": "Do the enlarged shopping bags retain their original geometric shapes without distorted edges or broken polygons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shopping bags are illustrated with clear, sharp edges and consistent geometric shapes. The lines appear intentional and precise, common in stylized illustrations. The bags maintain a smooth continuity in shape typical of how shopping bags are represented in artwork, without any irregularities or unexpected distortions.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coat is depicted with consistent color and texture across its surface, maintaining the appearance of a smooth, velvety material often seen in digital illustrations.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gloves are illustrated with a glossy appearance that showcases consistent shapes and reflections. The highlights are strategically placed to mimic the reflective nature of glossy material, matching the curvature of the fingers without distortion, which is typical in well-rendered digital art.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the open panel for personal messages is strategically placed to blend with the background, using matching color and texture. The lighting and texture of the panel are consistent with the surrounding area, ensuring it integrates well without appearing as a separate or added element, which is a common design technique in illustrations.",
