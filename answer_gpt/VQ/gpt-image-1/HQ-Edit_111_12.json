      "question": "Are the enlarged knitting needles proportionally consistent with the size of the woman's hands and aligned naturally with her fingers without bending or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knitting needles are held by the woman with a cartoonish appearance. The exaggerated features often seen in illustrations allow for some leeway in the exact proportions. The needles visually appear to fit well within the grasp of her illustrated hands, and their paths are aligned with her fingers without any significant bending or incorrect alignment. Therefore, they appear proportionally consistent and naturally aligned in the cartoon context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the steam lines above the teacup rise smoothly from the rim in a continuous, curved pattern without sharp breaks or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steam above the teacup is drawn in a stylized, smooth, and continuous curved line, typical of cartoon illustrations. This characteristic design aims for aesthetic simplicity and avoids sharp breaks, ensuring fluidity in the steam's motion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transformed yarn pattern on the fabric retain consistent knit stitches and natural thread flow without visible pixelation or irregular textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yarn is depicted in a simplified cartoon style with clear, consistent knit patterns. Given the artistic context of the image, which involves simple and repetitive patterns typical for cartoons, there is a uniformity in the stitch representation without any rough or pixelated areas.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the writing panel positioned within the open book pages such that its edges align naturally with the page boundaries and the knitted border matches the texture and color of the surrounding fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a blank writing panel that does not clearly connect to an open book but is instead presented with a border that harmonizes with the knitting theme in the image. The yarn-like border seamlessly integrates with the overall fabric-related theme. Despite lacking direct alignment with a book format, it is graphically consistent with the rest of the image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the added lamplight effect produce a gradual glow around the book and cup without creating unnatural bright spots or conflicting shadows on the armchair or wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illumination style is uniformly distributed, providing a warm ambient light consistent across the scene. This light does not produce sharp contrasts or unnatural shadows often avoided in such artistic representations. The light's depiction adds a cozy atmosphere without any disruptive bright spots or conflicting shadows.",
