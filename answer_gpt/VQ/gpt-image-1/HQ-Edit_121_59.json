    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the golden wand have smooth, reflective surfaces with consistent lighting and shadows that match the surrounding environment, and is it properly connected to the reel and the fisherman’s hand without gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the golden wand lacks realistic reflection characteristics typical of a smooth, metallic surface; it is depicted with a simplified, stylized look consistent with the caricature style. The wand is not visibly connected to a reel, nor is there a detailed connection to the fisherman’s hand, which is consistent with the artistic style. It appears floating rather than integrated into the scene with realistic lighting and shadows.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the hat and plaid shirt visibly enhanced but still consistent with real fabric appearance, with no pixelation, stretching, or broken patterns in the weave or seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures of the hat and plaid shirt are depicted in a simplified, illustrative style, not realistic. They lack details that would suggest enhancements, such as the weave or seams typical of real fabric textures. There's no evidence of pixelation, stretching, or broken patterns; the plaid pattern remains consistent with stylized fabric illustration.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the magical ripples originate from the tip of the wand and spread outward in continuous, concentric patterns that interact naturally with the water surface and reflections, without floating or disconnected wave segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ripples are stylized, depicted through simplistic, illustrative golden accents that mimic magical effects rather than realistic water interactions. They originate from the wand and spread outward but do not adhere to continuous, concentric patterns found in natural water ripple behavior; instead, they follow an artistic design consistent with the stylized environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden frame positioned around the image with correct perspective, consistent texture, and shadows that align with the scene’s lighting, and do the embossed pine tree details appear three-dimensional without distortion or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the fisherman’s hands show five fingers each with natural joint positioning and skin texture, and is his facial structure preserved without distortion in both the original and reflected image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the fisherman’s hands does not show detailed natural joint positioning or realistic skin texture; instead, they display oversized, rounded fingers consistent with caricature proportions. The facial structure is stylized and blurred, hence the focus is on the artistic consistency rather than natural distortion.",
