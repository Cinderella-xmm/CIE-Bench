      "question": "Does the chibi version of the woman have a proportionally enlarged head relative to the body, with limbs and torso scaled down appropriately without deformed joints or elongated limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi style is characterized by an exaggeratedly large head compared to a smaller body, typical of this design approach, which emphasizes cuteness by rendering the head larger. The limbs and torso appear scaled down proportionately without unnatural distortion, maintaining the essence of the chibi aesthetic where proportions are adjusted to give a whimsical and charming impression. There are no signs of deformed joints or elongated limbs, as the style is meant to be simplistic yet endearing.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the oversized frills on the gown rendered with curved, layered shapes that suggest fabric volume, and do they avoid flat, rigid edges or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the gown's frills are depicted using rounded, layered shapes indicative of volume and depth, which follow the principles of chibi and cartoon design. These shapes effectively convey a voluminous fabric look without presenting flat or stiff edges, crucial for retaining the lively, soft portrayal typical of such styles. The frills do not exhibit unnatural stretching, adhering to the consistent, rounded aesthetic typical in cartoon depictions.",

      "question": "Do the gold accents on the jewelry show consistent metallic highlights and soft shadows that align with the lighting direction in the scene, without harsh glints or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold accents on the jewelry display highlights and shadows that match the chibi style's simplified and bright coloration, which often lacks detailed shading but retains enough consistency to imply a light source direction. Despite the simplicity, these accents do not suffer from harsh glints or artificial-looking textures, aligning smoothly with the overall lighting of the scene. The highlights maintain a level of softness appropriate for the cartoon style.",

      "explanation": "Image B features a chair that remains clearly identifiable through its shape and position.
