      "question": "Does the outline of the guitar body remain intact and undistorted after being converted into an armored torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a creative transformation of a guitar into a superhero-like figure, named 'Strum Crusader.' The torso resembles a guitar body with an anthropomorphized design. Despite the artistic conversion to a figure's chest armor, the essence and recognizable shape of a guitar are retained. The silhouette reflects the guitar's original form translated into a stylized torso without distortion of its basic outline.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the metallic finish applied to the guitar body consistent with the original wood grain pattern, showing no signs of artificial texture tiling or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrative style maintains the wooden texture observed in the original guitar from Image A, albeit with an intensified and exaggerated rendering to fit the superhero theme. The color gradients and shading used denote a wood texture rather than a metallic finish. Thus, the representation respects the wood grain aesthetic instead of converting it to a metallic appearance, and there are no visible signs of texture tiling or odd reflections.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the illustrative lines evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the guitar's curvature without overlapping or cutting through structural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B shows elaborate linework intended to resemble the texture of wood and the contours of muscle in a superhero figure. The lines are integrated into the design, but they appear slightly stylized to give an expressive quality. While the lines follow the curvature of the form, they overlap intentionally to create the texture effect, which is a part of the artistic freedom rather than an error in alignment or structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the strings appear as continuous, taut muscle strands that follow the bodyâ€™s contour without kinks, gaps, or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar strings are reimagined as part of the musculature of the superhero figure. These lines are continuous and follow the contour of the form, indicative of tautness, much like muscles. There are no visible kinks, gaps, or inconsistencies in the rendering of these elements, showing a smooth integration into the depicted style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cape extend naturally from the neck, showing smooth folds and consistent sound wave patterns along its length without abrupt changes or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cape in Image B flows from the neck region with a dramatic, wave-like pattern. The illustration shows a consistent wave design across the cape without abrupt discontinuities, suiting the theme of motion and sound associated with the guitar and music. The smooth transitions and thematic lines suggest deliberate design choices rather than errors.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the emblem on the headstock fully visible, correctly aligned, and not overlapping with the tuning pegs or brand name?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headstock has been converted into a helm-like area on the character. While an emblem, resembling a music note, is visible on the forehead of the character, it is not displayed in the traditional headstock position. There is no rendered guitar headstock with visible tuning pegs or brand name. Instead, the emblem aligns with the creative design of the illustration, focused on thematically incorporating musical elements into the character.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as pixelation, color bleeding, or sharp discontinuities at the junctions between original guitar parts and added elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a polished illustration combining different elements into a cohesive superhero character. The transitions, while offering distinct segments such as the guitar body and cape, appear smooth, maintaining a stylistic cohesion typical of professional comic or graphic illustrations. There are no observable artifacts like pixelation, color bleeding, or awkward joining issues at the intersections of the different visual components.",
