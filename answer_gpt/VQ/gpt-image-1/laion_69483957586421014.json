    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the packaging box maintain correct proportions relative to the food processor, especially in alignment with the base and handle, without any distorted edges or warped geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging box appears to maintain correct proportions relative to the food processor depicted. The alignment between the base and handle of the food processor, as shown on the box, matches correctly, and there are no visible signs of distortion or warped geometry. The geometry looks typical for packaging based on common design principles, which favors symmetry and proportionality for aesthetic and practical reasons.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the 'Waring' brand name clearly visible and properly aligned on the packaging without overlapping or distorting adjacent elements such as the appliance illustration or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Waring' brand name is prominently displayed at the top of the packaging and along the side. The text is clear, legible, and properly aligned with no visible distortion or overlap with the appliance illustration or background elements. This reflects common branding practices where the brand name is made clearly visible without interference from other elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the isometric illustration of the food processor on the box accurately reflect the original object's geometry, including the feed tube, lid, and base, without distortion or incorrect angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration of the food processor on the box in Image B seems to accurately replicate the geometry of the original object as shown in Image A. The feed tube, lid, and base are depicted correctly, with appropriate angles, scale, and proportions that match typical design standards for technical illustrations, minimizing errors in visual reproduction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the exploded components of the food processor depicted with accurate shapes and positions, maintaining their original form and material texture without stretching or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The exploded components depicted on the side of the box in Image B are presented with what appear to be accurate shapes and positions relative to their assembly in the food processor. The forms are kept in proportion, with visible material texture that aligns with typical expectations for 3D illustrations, avoiding common issues like stretching or blurring that might arise from improper scaling.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the metallic silver and matte black surfaces of the packaging display natural material finishes without unnatural reflections, graininess, or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic silver and matte black surfaces of the packaging in Image B appear to maintain natural material finishes. There are no signs of unnatural reflections, graininess, or texture artifacts. The colors and finishes are consistent with professional package design practices where the surface texture and gloss are controlled to provide a clean and appealing aesthetic.",
