    "Question": "Q1: Does the ogre's body have simplified yet coherent proportions with no distorted limbs or unnatural joint angles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre appears as a stylized chibi character with simplified proportions typical of such designs. The limbs are short and robust, with consistent and coherent proportions, reflecting a deliberate art style choice to emphasize cute and exaggerated features. There are no distorted limbs or unnatural joint angles that would suggest a mistake in design. This is common in cartoon and toy design, where the emphasis is on a playful appearance rather than realistic anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the surface of the ogre’s body and clothing uniformly matte with no shiny reflections or residual skin texture?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the ogre with a texture that is uniformly matte, consistent with the appearance of a toy or digital illustration. The surface lacks any shiny reflections or realistic skin texture, enhancing the toy-like or animated look. This consistency in the surface finish suggests a design choice to maintain a uniform appearance throughout the character.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the foam club visibly softer in edge definition, larger in scale, and held securely in the ogre’s right hand without deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre holds a club that is cartoonishly large and rounded, fitting the exaggerated style of the character. The edge definition is intentionally softer, aligning with a playful, toy-like design. The character's grip on the club is firm, fitting snugly into the hand without signs of deformation. This reflects a common theme in chibi-style figures where props are exaggerated and simplified.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the fur-trimmed cape attached at the shoulders, extending downward without clipping into the body or appearing detached?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cape is designed to attach neatly at the ogre's shoulders, with the fur-trimmed design extending downward in a consistent manner. There are no visible issues, such as clipping into the body or appearing detached, which would disrupt the visual coherence. The attachment is clear and smooth, fitting with the overall stylized and simplified design approach.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the rocky base fully grounded, with the plaque clearly engraved and readable, and no floating or shadow inconsistency?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rocky base under the ogre is clearly depicted with a flat, grounded appearance. The plaque is clearly visible, engraved with the label 'MIGHTY OGRE', and is readable without distortion. The shadows are consistent with a grounded object, indicating no floating illusion or shadow inconsistencies. This reflects a well-constructed and visually cohesive base for the figure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
