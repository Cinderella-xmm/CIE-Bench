    "Question": "Q1: Do the shoulder and chest armor sections display realistic metallic sheen with proper light reflection and depth, avoiding flat or overly shiny surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shoulder and chest armor has a detailed metallic finish that captures realistic reflections and depth. This is evident from the way light sources create highlights and shadows across the surface. The reflective properties are well-balanced, avoiding an overly shiny appearance, indicative of high-quality digital rendering of metallic surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the joint areas of the armor aligned with the underlying anatomy and free from geometric distortions or unnatural gaps?",
    "explanation": "The joint areas in Image B are carefully modeled to align with the likely positions of the human body's joints. The continuity of the armor across these points shows no geometric distortions or gaps, suggesting a high degree of anatomical fidelity in how the armor is rendered.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the metallic hair strands appear as continuous, flowing wires with consistent color gradients and reflective properties, without breaking or clumping unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hair strands are presented as metallic wires, seamlessly flowing and consistently spaced with appropriate reflections and smooth color gradients from the lighting. They maintain a natural, continuous appearance without any visible breaks or unnatural clumping, indicating meticulous attention to detail in their rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background a uniform, neutral gray tone with no visible remnants of the original setting or inconsistent lighting?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is a uniform, neutral gray tone. It shows no remaining elements from any previous setting, and the lighting is consistent, contributing to a clear focus on the subject without distractions or inconsistencies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all edited regions—armor, hair, and background—seamlessly integrated with smooth transitions and no visible artifacts like pixelation or mismatched edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the armor, hair, and background are all well-integrated. There are smooth transitions between these elements with no noticeable pixelation or mismatched edges, showing a high level of skill in editing and blending the different components together seamlessly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
