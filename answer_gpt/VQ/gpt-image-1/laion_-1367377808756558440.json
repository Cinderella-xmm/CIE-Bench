      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brass finishes on the ship’s hull and superstructure smooth and consistent in texture, with no visible cracks, pixelation, or mismatched shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is depicted within a glass lantern with a steampunk aesthetic, characterized by its brass finishes. The brass texture is visually smooth and consistent, with a polished look that reflects light evenly, suggesting careful rendering. There are no evident flaws such as cracks, pixelation, or shading inconsistencies, highlighting a clean and uniform finish across the ship's hull and superstructure. This conclusion is based on the typical expectations of a polished brass look in visual art, where attention to detail ensures a coherent appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metal automatons have five fingers per hand, properly articulated limbs, and clothing that conforms to the body shape without unnatural wrinkles or floating fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene includes figures reminiscent of metal automatons or figurines, typical of a steampunk theme. These figures appear stylized and are not detailed enough to confirm standard anatomical features like five fingers per hand. They have articulated limbs, but their clothing and features are simplified, with a rigid appearance rather than conforming naturally to the body. The figures seem to be more decorative than functional automatons, akin to miniature statues or simplified representations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass lantern clearly defined around the scene, with transparent sides, visible metal framing, and no overlapping or missing sections that break the enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship and surrounding elements are encased in a glass lantern, which is well-defined with clear, transparent sides allowing visibility of the scene within. The metal framing of the lantern is distinct, outlining the enclosure neatly. There are no overlapping or missing sections disrupting the continuity of the glass lantern, indicating accurate rendering and a complete enclosure, typical of well-crafted display cases or containers used for showcasing such thematic pieces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the steam clouds rendered with smooth gradients and soft edges, appearing to float naturally within the lantern without jagged borders or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam clouds in Image B are depicted with a soft, ethereal quality, characterized by smooth gradients and gentle edges. They give the impression of naturally floating within the glass lantern, contributing to the whimsical steampunk ambience. The clouds do not possess any jagged borders or abrupt color shifts, which aligns with expected practices in art to create a sense of realism and depth, thereby enhancing the cohesiveness of the steampunk theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the compasses and flags placed in logical positions relative to the ship and dock, with proper orientation and size that does not distort the spatial relationships between objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the compass and flags complement the steampunk theme. The compass is visually integrated as part of the background, creating a harmonious visual connection with the ship. The flags are properly oriented and proportionate, maintaining a suitable scale relative to the ship and the dock-like setting around it. There is coherence in spatial positioning, ensuring no distortion occurs between the objects and maintaining a believable scene within the constraints of artistic interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the rotating gears and mechanical components attached to the ship’s structure with visible supports, and do they follow the contours of the hull and deck without floating or intersecting incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image features gears and mechanical components in alignment with the ship's steampunk style. These elements appear to be part of the ship's structural design, meticulously attached with visible supports that seamlessly integrate into the hull and deck's contours. There's an absence of floating gears or incorrect intersections, which demonstrates thoughtful attention to mechanical plausibility and coherence within the artwork's visual storytelling.",
