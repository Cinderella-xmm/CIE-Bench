    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi Funko Pop-style figure maintain the structural coherence of the child's facial features without introducing unnatural distortions?",
    "explanation": "The figure adopts the chibi or Funko Pop style, which is characterized by exaggerated head-to-body proportions, often featuring a larger head and minimal facial details. This style inherently distorts typical human facial proportions for aesthetic purposes. Since this design choice aligns with common practices for chibi figures, it doesnâ€™t fall under 'unnatural distortions' as per the aesthetic standards of the Funko Pop style.",
