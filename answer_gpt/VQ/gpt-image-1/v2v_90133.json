      "question": "Does the metallic, multifaceted eye cluster derived from the NXP module appear structurally consistent with the original module's shape and size, without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic, multifaceted eye cluster is a transformation of the original NXP module. The eyes are stylized to fit the beetle theme, which involves altering the original shape of the module to form rounded, insect-like eyes. Despite the modifications for artistic representation, these transformations do not introduce unnatural textures or significant distortions that would detract from a cohesive look. The size of the eye cluster is proportionate to the beetle body, maintaining structural consistency without noticeable size discrepancies.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bioluminescent spots created from the solder points on the green circuit board visually plausible and detailed, without breaking the original geometric shapes or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the solder points from the green circuit board appear as bioluminescent spots on the cyborg beetle's body. These glowing spots are well-integrated into the overall design, maintaining the geometric arrangement typical of a circuit board without introducing distortions or artifacts. The bioluminescent effect is convincingly rendered, enhancing the beetle's appearance while preserving the circuit board's original pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the glowing wing veins evolved from the circuit board's traces maintain a natural appearance and retain fine details, without introducing unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wing veins in Image B, derived from the circuit board traces, retain a natural insect-wing appearance while incorporating the structure and detail from the original circuit board. The glowing effect is well-executed, adding a bioluminescent quality to the wings that logically fits within the concept of a mechanical beetle. The veins are detailed and consistent, avoiding any unnatural textures or visual artifacts that would break the overall seamless look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the overall composition and layout of the cyborg beetle, formed by blending the NXP module and the green circuit board, visually credible and structurally consistent, without introducing distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the combination of the NXP module and the green circuit board has been creatively transformed into a cyborg beetle. The composition makes sense within this artistic context, with the module forming part of the body and the circuit board elements extending into wings and legs. The layout is balanced, cohesive, and does not suffer from visual distortions or artifacts. The beetle is convincingly structured, maintaining consistency with the concept of a cyborg creature.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the neutral background remain unchanged and free of artifacts after the transformation of the NXP module and the green circuit board into the cyborg beetle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background remains neutral with a consistent color tone, similar to the plain background found in Image A. There are no visible artifacts or changes introduced into the background as a result of the transformation process. The focus remains on the beetle itself, with the unchanged background providing a seamless, distraction-free backdrop.",
