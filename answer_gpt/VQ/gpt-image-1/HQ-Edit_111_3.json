    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the monochrome line-drawings for the antennae, wings, abdomen, and thorax accurately aligned with the actual anatomy of the butterfly and do they follow its natural contours without overlapping incorrectly or creating geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monochrome line drawings are overlaid to indicate different anatomical parts of the butterfly. The lines are well-aligned with the butterfly's features such as the antennae, wings, abdomen, and thorax. They follow the natural contours of these sections accurately, avoiding any overlapping or geometric distortions that would misrepresent the butterfly's anatomy. This is concluded by observing the lines in relation to the butterfly's natural form, which appears correct and consistent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the added pink petals appear seamlessly integrated into the surrounding flora with consistent lighting, texture, and shadow alignment, avoiding any visible seams or artificial edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pink petals are examined for seamless integration into the existing floral background. They match the lighting, with proper shadow alignment ensuring the petals appear a natural part of the surrounding flora. There are no visible seams or artificial edges indicating poor integration, as the petals texture and color harmonize with the existing flowers and foliage. This suggests an application consistent with realistic botanical images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the text boxes positioned in non-obtrusive areas of the image, clearly readable, and visually balanced so they do not interfere with the butterfly or floral elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, text boxes are positioned strategically to provide informational content without interfering with the butterfly and floral visuals. These boxes are placed in areas free from critical details, ensuring visual balance and readability. By assessing their location and the layout, it is evident they are well-integrated into the image’s design, preventing obstruction and maintaining a harmonious visual flow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the vibrant blue color of the butterfly’s wings preserved uniformly across all areas, including under and around the overlaid anatomical lines, without any visible discoloration or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly wings in Image B maintain their vibrant blue color uniformly, even under and around the anatomical lines. Upon close observation, there are no areas of discoloration or loss of detail affecting the vibrancy of the blue wings. The overlays have been applied with precision to retain visual integrity without affecting the butterfly’s characteristic coloration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, pixelation, or unnatural textures in the areas where edits were made (e.g., line drawings, text boxes, added petals)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examination of the edited areas such as the line drawings, text boxes, and added petals reveals no noticeable artifacts like jagged lines, pixelation, or unnatural textures. The edits are executed cleanly and integrated well into the image, maintaining high quality and avoiding common digital editing artifacts. This suggests careful attention during the editing process to preserve smooth lines and textures.",
