    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the bust have a visibly coherent head-to-body proportion where the head is enlarged relative to the torso but remains structurally plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head appears enlarged relative to the torso, which is a common characteristic in chibi or stylized art forms. This enlarged head-to-body ratio is still structurally plausible within the context of this style as it retains the proportions typically associated with such representations in art and collectibles. Thus, the head-to-body proportion appears coherent for this context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial features simplified but still clearly defined, with no missing or distorted elements such as eyes or mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face is blurred and no facial features such as eyes or a mouth can be assessed for their simplification or definition. Therefore, without visible features to evaluate, no conclusion can be made regarding their presence or clarity.",

      "question": "Do the embroidered patterns on the robe appear continuous and logically structured, without jagged edges or disrupted textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The embroidered patterns on the robe in Image B appear to be continuous and follow a logical arrangement. The patterns are well-defined with consistent textures and colors, depicting detailed craftsmanship without noticeable digital artifacts or disruptions in their structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes on the headdress are evenly spaced and exhibit a smooth color application. There are no visible signs of color bleeding or misalignment that could indicate digital artifacts or errors, suggesting a clean and precise execution of the design.",

      "question": "Does the pomegranate have a glossy surface with natural-looking highlights that do not distort its shape or create false reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pomegranate in Image B has a glossy surface with highlights that reflect light realistically. These highlights enhance the 3D effect and look natural without distorting the shape or creating misleading reflections. This suggests a high-quality render or material application on the object.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B is clearly attached to the bust and appears visually grounded. There are no signs of floating sections or misalignment between the base and the bust, indicating that the connection is stable and the base serves as a well-integrated foundation for the overall piece.",
