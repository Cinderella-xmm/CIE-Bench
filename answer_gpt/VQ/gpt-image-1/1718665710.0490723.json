      "question": "Is the head proportionally enlarged without distorting facial features or flattening the curls of the hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain depicts a stylized character with exaggerated features typical of a chibi design, where the head is naturally larger compared to the body to emphasize cuteness. The curls of the hair maintain their rounded and detailed appearance, aligning with the style's expectation. This suggests that the head is proportionally enlarged in a manner consistent with chibi art, without distorting details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black outlines uniformly thick and cleanly separated from internal details such as hair, skin, and armor engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi keychain image, black outlines are prominently featured around all components, including the hair, skin, armor engravings, and other details. The outlines are consistent in thickness, defining areas within the design without bleeding into internal details, which helps in maintaining separation and clarity of distinct features.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the armor display consistent glossy reflections and smooth color transitions without pixelation or repeating patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor in Image B does not exhibit detailed reflections or color transitions, as it is a simplified representation typical of a chibi or animated style. Instead, the armor is filled with solid colors, intentionally lacking the detailed surface texture found in realistic images. Therefore, judging from the image's purpose and style, the armor's representation is suitable for its artistic design without apparent pixelation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shoulder pauldrons and chest plate clearly defined with intact edges and symmetrical design, free from geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi keychain depicts armor pieces with bold outlines that emphasize the shape and symmetry of the shoulder pauldrons and chest plate. Each element is visually enclosed, maintaining structural integrity without distortion. The symmetry aligns with standard design principles for uniformity and aesthetics, typical for such stylized depictions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the silver chain attached at a coherent point and composed of uniformly shaped links that appear physically connected to the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the keychain image, the silver chain is positioned at the top, connecting at a point that appears practical for such an accessory. The links are consistently shaped, forming a logical and complete chain that realistically attaches to the figure. This reflects proper design coherence in the accessory's construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the background exhibit a uniform dark texture with no bright reflections or unnatural gradients, consistent with velvet material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is uniformly dark, offering a consistent texture without any bright reflections or unusual color shifts. This aligns with the characteristics of velvet material, designed to present a smooth and even appearance that serves appropriately as a backdrop for the vibrant keychain design.",
