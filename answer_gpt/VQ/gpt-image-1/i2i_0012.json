        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Mona Lisa's facial features have been obscured by a blur, so there are no visible details to assess. Therefore, there are no rendered features or possible artifacts to evaluate for this region of the image.",

      "question": "Does the edited background in Studio Ghibli style retain its visual plausibility and avoid breaking the geometric shapes seen in the original painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains visual plausibility in the background by employing smooth, flowing lines and an illustrative color scheme identifiable with Studio Ghibli's style.

This interpretation maintains a coherent and believable landscape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Mona Lisa's dress displays smoother and more simplified patterns typical of the Studio Ghibli style, which favors broad shading and less intricate detail. While the detailed textures of the original are replaced by a more uniform style, the depiction remains coherent and fitting within a stylized interpretation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Mona Lisa's hands are depicted with a stylized simplicity, yet the finger count and general positioning are consistent with natural human anatomy. The posture and ergonomic placement of the hands are preserved in the Studio Ghibli style, ensuring they look natural and appropriately rendered.",
