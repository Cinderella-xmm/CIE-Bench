    "Question": "Q1: Does the isometric packaging box have consistent edges, proper depth cues, and accurate alignment with the toy figures without visible warping or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the packaging box shows consistent edges and proper depth cues. The alignment of the box with the toy figures inside is accurate, with no visible warping or misalignment. The box appears well-constructed, giving an impression of a commercially viable product. These observations suggest that the packaging is designed accurately according to 3D perspective rules.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the chibi-style figures inside the box proportionally consistent with typical chibi design rules (e.g., large heads, short limbs) and do they retain identifiable features of the original car and robot?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figures exhibit proportions consistent with typical chibi design, characterized by large heads and short limbs. The robot design maintains identifiable features from the original robot in Image A, with the car's front section used as part of the robot's body, similar to how it rearranges in Image A. This reflects a successful adaptation of key aesthetic elements while adhering to chibi style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the mini tool set, interchangeable helmets, and gear base clearly defined, properly scaled, and positioned without floating or clipping through other elements inside the box?",
    "explanation": "The mini tool set, interchangeable helmets, and gear base in Image B are distinctly presented within the packaging. They are well-rendered, with clear definitions and appropriately scaled relative to the figures and the space within the box. There is no apparent floating or clipping through other elements, indicating thoughtful design and layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the external surfaces of the car and robot exhibit consistent metallic textures with natural highlights and reflections, without visible artifacts like blotches or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the external surfaces of both the car and robot feature consistent metallic textures that exhibit natural highlights and reflections. The surfaces are smooth, without any visible artifacts such as blotches or jagged edges, indicating a high level of detail and rendering technique applied to replicate metallic properties.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the reflections and lighting on the showcase surface consistent with the direction of light and the materials of the figures, without unnatural glare or shadow mismatches?",
    "explanation": "The reflections and lighting in Image B are consistent with the light source direction and the reflective materials of the figures. The showcase surface as depicted does not exhibit unnatural glare or mismatched shadows, suggesting that the lighting setup was carefully considered to enhance the realism of the scene and accurately represent the materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"
