    "Question": "Q1: Do the man's limbs and torso maintain proportional relationships and natural joint articulation despite stylization?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man's limbs and torso are stylized but maintain their proportions relative to real human anatomy, with joints appearing correctly articulated in a manner that remains visually coherent while artistically simplified. The exaggerated art style doesn't disrupt the proportionality expected in a stylized representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the textures of the tuxedo and fur jacket rendered with sufficient detail and depth to appear physically plausible despite stylization?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a stylized rendition of the tuxedo and fur jacket, where the textures are simplified but still convey a sense of depth and material quality. The texture lines and shading give a believable impression of fabric and fur, consistent with stylized art that omits intricate detailing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the FIA logo and sponsor names clearly visible and correctly formed within the simplified linear background design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the FIA logo and sponsor names are simplified but legible against the background. They maintain their correct forms, and while the complexity is reduced, it preserves readability and the identifiable elements of the logos and text.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the gold ribbon-like border fully closed, evenly shaped, and consistently thick around the entire perimeter of the stamp?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the gold ribbon-like border appears to be consistently thick and evenly shaped without any gaps, ensuring a complete and visually coherent perimeter for the stamp design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the embossed logo on the blue envelope show consistent depth, soft shadows, and surface texture without appearing flat or artificially rendered?",
    "explanation": "The embossed logo in Image B displays depth and soft shadows, suggesting texture variation that creates a realistic embossed effect. The shadows and lighting imply physical dimension, avoiding a flat appearance and enhancing realism within the stylized envelope design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the stamp positioned with appropriate shadowing and perspective to appear physically attached to the envelope surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shadowing and perspective are aligned well, giving the impression that the stamp is affixed onto the blue envelope. The shadows and angle contribute to the perception of physical attachment, reinforcing the realism in the stylized depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q7: Do both individuals have exactly five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no deformation or missing digits?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the stylization of the figures, the individuals have hands that show five fingers each, maintaining natural shapes without evident deformation or missing digits. This depiction supports plausible human anatomy in the artistic representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
