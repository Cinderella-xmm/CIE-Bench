    "Question": "Q1: Does the mosaic pattern on the saree maintain uniform tesserae size and alignment across the fabric, with no visible seams or distorted tiles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sarees worn by the figures have been transformed into a mosaic pattern. The tesserae on the fabric appear consistently sized and are well-aligned, forming a harmonious design. There are no noticeable seams or distorted tiles that interrupt the flow of the pattern, suggesting a careful and uniform application of the mosaic technique.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the arches and dome of the transformed building structurally coherent, with straight edges, consistent curvature, and no broken or misaligned geometry?",
    "explanation": "The building in Image B, which appears inspired by a mosaic style, maintains structural coherence. The arches and dome depicted in the mosaic exhibit straight edges and consistent curvatures. The geometry is intact, with no apparent breaks or misalignments, indicating a stable transformation from a real architecture to a mosaic version.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do both hands show five fingers each, with natural finger spacing and joint alignment, and no extra digits or unnatural bending?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figures' hands in the mosaic art are stylized according to the artistic norms of the medium. Each hand appears to depict a simple form without detailed individual fingers, which is common in mosaic art styles. While specific finger details are not visible due to the artistic representation, there are no apparent extra digits or unnatural bends in the design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the floral motifs evenly distributed and proportionally sized relative to the surrounding architecture, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "In the mosaic of Image B, the floral motifs are incorporated into the design as decorative elements. They appear evenly distributed and are proportionally sized concerning the architectural features and other decorative elements. The motifs are integrated into the background without appearing to float or overlap incorrectly, adhering to the conventions of mosaic art.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the golden backdrop exhibit smooth gradient transitions and subtle surface variations, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural shine?",
    "explanation": "The golden backdrop in Image B, within the mosaic style, often results in a uniform color due to the nature of tesserae pieces. Consequently, while the mosaic offers a rich visual texture, it does not display smooth gradient transitions as would be expected in a painted piece. Sudden shifts in color and variations in shine are not unnatural but rather typical features of mosaic artwork.",
    "answer": "No"
