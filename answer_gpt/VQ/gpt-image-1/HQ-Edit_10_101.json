      "question": "Are the knitted textures on the cardigan visibly exaggerated but still consistent with real knitting patterns, without broken stitches or irregular loops?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knitted textures on the cardigan are prominently detailed, creating an exaggerated appearance that highlights the knitting pattern.

      "question": "Do the buttons exhibit metallic sheen with realistic highlights and shadows that match the surrounding fabric and ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buttons on the cardigan show a metallic sheen due to well-placed highlights and shadows. This is achieved through a realistic rendering technique that considers how light interacts with metallic surfaces. The highlights and shadows are coherent with the ambient light and the texture of the cardigan, matching how light would naturally play off reflective surfaces when surrounded by fabric.",

      "question": "Does the color of the cardigan maintain a warm tone that complements the vintage floral wallpaper without introducing unnatural color shifts or contrast mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardigan's coloration is a warm brown, which harmonizes effectively with the vintage floral wallpaper seen in the background. This choice of color creates a cohesive visual aesthetic, avoiding any harsh or unnatural color shifts. The cardigan's hue complements the wallpaper rather than clashing with it, and there are no stark contrasts or mismatches in the visual elements.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the embroidery on the frame is meticulously detailed, showcasing clear definition and alignment with the edges of the frame.

      "question": "Is the canvas texture evenly distributed across the entire image, preserving fine details such as hair, facial lines, and fabric weave without blurring or obscuring them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the canvas texture is subtle and does not interfere with the legibility of fine details. While specific characteristics like hair or facial lines are not visible in the edited image, the fabric weave is complex and remains finely detailled, preserving the texture of the cardigan without blurring. The evenly distributed canvas texture supports the visual clarity of these details without causing any obscuring.",
