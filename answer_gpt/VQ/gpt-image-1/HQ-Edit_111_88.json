      "question": "Does the dancer’s raised leg and arm maintain natural human proportions and joint alignment despite the stylized design, with no visible geometric distortion or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's raised leg and arm appear to be consistent with natural human proportions and alignment. The stylized design focuses on fluid motion typical of Art Nouveau, emphasizing graceful lines. Here, the limbs retain an elegant, elongated form without causing geometric distortion or suggesting an unnatural position, reflecting a well-studied understanding of the human form.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background elements in Image B, including huts and trees, exhibit smooth, curved forms that are consistent with Art Nouveau aesthetics.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the cloth is portrayed with attention to anatomical correctness, displaying five fingers that are naturally spaced and curved.
