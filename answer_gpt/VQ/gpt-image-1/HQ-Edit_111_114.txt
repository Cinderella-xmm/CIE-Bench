    "Question": "Q1: Are the limbs of the man and the components of the scooter proportionally coherent and free from geometric distortion such as elongated arms, bent knees, or misaligned wheels?",
    "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) depicts a stylized illustration of a man on a scooter, rendered in a cartoonish manner. The limbs and scooter components are intentionally exaggerated to fit the caricature style, with disproportionately short and rounded forms typical in such art. However, there is no obvious geometric distortion like elongation or misalignment beyond this stylized choice.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the sepia tones cover all areas evenly without visible color banding, blotchy patches, or loss of detail in textures like fabric, stone, or foliage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sepia tone is applied uniformly across the entire image, maintaining the clarity of details and the textures, albeit in a simplified graphic style. The even coloration is consistent with the vintage postcard theme without any evident banding or patches.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the edges of the image softly degraded with a smooth transition into white, without abrupt lines or visible masking artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the defined illustration itself does not transition into white as it is framed with an art-nouveau border. Therefore, the concept of edge degradation does not apply to this style, suggesting that within its own context, the transition does not feature abrupt lines or artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the art-nouveau frame surround the image without overlapping or cutting through the man’s face, scooter, or any background structures?",
    "explanation": "The art-nouveau frame in Image B is clearly placed around each postcard depiction, not intruding into the illustration of the man and the scooter. It is designed to provide a separate decorative border typical of such designs, without overlapping the primary visual subjects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the blank writing area located directly beneath the image, aligned horizontally, and free from warping or interference with the scooter’s base or ground line?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the area meant for writing is distinctly part of the postcard design, situated neatly and horizontally aligned, separate from the main graphic. The simplicity of the design affords no interference or warping effects in relation to the scooter or ground line depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the parchment texture appear uniformly across the image without causing blurring, ghosting, or obscuration of fine details like the man’s beard or window shutters?",
    "explanation": "Image B exhibits a uniform parchment texture as is characteristic of vintage paper designs, without any undue blurring or ghosting disrupting the simplified graphical elements. However, the stylistic choice minimizes detail naturally, consistent with the source material.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the postcards arranged in a stack with realistic shadows, overlapping edges, and twine wrapped around them in a way that suggests physical binding?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the postcards are depicted with overlapping edges and shadows that suggest depth and a physical stack. The visible twine convincingly mimics a binding mode, enhancing the tactile, three-dimensional impression without requiring precise realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
