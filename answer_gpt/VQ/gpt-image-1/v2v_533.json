      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar and microphone are represented in a chibi-style 3D design, characterized by the addition of features like large eyes and a smiling mouth on the guitar. This style typically emphasizes a cute, cartoonish appearance with exaggerated or simplified proportions. The guitar still resembles its original shape but in a playful manner. Similarly, the microphone maintains its recognizability while being adapted to the chibi style.",
