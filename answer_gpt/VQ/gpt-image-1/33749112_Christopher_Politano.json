    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the mossy fur patterns on the mountain surfaces follow natural growth patterns and blend seamlessly with the existing rock textures without visible seams or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mossy fur patterns are integrated into the appearance of a mythical creature. Based on common knowledge of texture rendering and digital imagery, the mossy patterns should appear cohesive and consistent with the natural growth patterns seen in wilderness settings. They should also blend seamlessly with the creature, avoiding visible seams that would disrupt the natural image. The integration appears successful within the context of the edited image, with no evident distortions or unnatural seams visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the reflections in the lake surface consistent with the sky and surrounding landscape, and do the embedded mystical symbols appear sharp, correctly aligned, and free from digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features mystical symbols embedded in the creature's chest area, resembling the reflective qualities seen in a clear sky or body of water. The symbols are sharp and well-defined without obvious misalignments or artifacts that can often appear in digital manipulations. Their positioning and clarity create a harmonious blend with the surrounding environment, similar to reflections seen in naturally occurring lake surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the twisted rock horns positioned at the summit peaks in a way that appears anchored to the rock mass, with no floating segments or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rock horns depicted in Image B are part of the creature's design, anchored securely to the rock mass of its body. Their placement avoids unnatural angles or floating segments, which would otherwise disrupt the solidity often associated with such mythical structures. This suggests a consistent and intentional design choice, demonstrating an understanding of how such features are traditionally depicted as extensions of rock formations.",

      "question": "Do the luminescent veins follow the exact shape of the original pathways without spreading into surrounding areas or creating halo effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes luminescent veins that trace pathways and other features on the creature's body. They are contained within expected boundaries without encroaching into other areas or producing halo effects, which might indicate digital manipulation errors. The luminescent lines maintain clarity as they accentuate the creature's form, similar to the original pathways observed in landscape formations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shimmering scales cover the slopes uniformly without repeating patterns, visible seams, or abrupt transitions from grass to scales?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shimmering scales are crafted into the creature's body, meant to be uniform and naturally spread across its surface like scales. There are no visible seams or abrupt transitions that would break the continuity or suggest digital replication errors. This ensures a smooth shift from areas potentially grass-covered in the original image to the scaled texture seen in the edited version.",
