      "question": "Does the top hat sit naturally on the capybara's head without distorting the head shape or causing visible seams or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top hat appears to rest naturally on the capybara's head. The hat fits well and follows the contour of the head without creating any visible distortion, interruption in the texture, or inconsistencies in the fur around the contact area. These observations lead to the conclusion that the top hat is well-integrated with the image, utilizing our knowledge of how clothing and accessories should realistically interact with an animal's form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the teacup held by the capybara’s front paws at a natural angle and scale, with no deformation or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara holds the teacup with a realistic grip using its front paws. The angle at which the paw meets the teacup appears consistent with a natural holding position, and the teacup is proportionately sized for the capybara, showing no signs of deformation or an unrealistic floating appearance. This indicates a coherent integration of the teacup into the scene, supported by our understanding of how objects should appear when held by similar creatures.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the suit worn by the capybara exhibit consistent fabric texture, natural draping, and appropriate seam lines that follow the animal’s body contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a capybara dressed in a suit that fits its body well. The fabric texture is consistent throughout the suit, with natural-looking drapes and seams that appropriately follow the body's contours. This observation is in alignment with the expectation for how tailored clothes should fit on an animal's form, demonstrating skillful editing.",

      "question": "Is the monocle positioned properly over the capybara’s eye without overlapping fur unnaturally or showing rendering artifacts like ghosting or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The monocle in Image B is placed correctly over the capybara's eye, with no evident issues of fur overlap, ghosting, or misalignment. This positioning aligns with our understanding of how monocles should be worn in relation to facial features, providing a seamless integration into the capybara's appearance without rendering errors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the London riverscape background align with the lighting and time of day of the original scene, and do architectural elements like Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament appear proportionally correct and spatially coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes the London riverscape with the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben, depicted coherently with the lighting and time of day presented in the scene. The architectural elements are proportionately correct, and they fit naturally within the image as dictated by standard depictions of this iconic landscape. This creates a visually integrated scene, indicating a successful composite.",
