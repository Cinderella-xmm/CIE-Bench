      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi character wearing a yellow hard hat, green shirt, and orange vest, which are coherent with the expected attire of a construction worker. The colors and materials appear consistent and suitable for the 3D environment, where bright colors are often used to denote safety equipment. This matches the expectations for a cartoon construction worker character.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is integrated into a low-poly construction environment. This includes nearby elements like traffic cones and building blocks.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a light gray background with a small crane model, aligning with a construction-themed setting removed from natural or beach scenery elements. This is consistent with the 3D construction scene, and there are no traces of beach landscape elements from Image A.",
