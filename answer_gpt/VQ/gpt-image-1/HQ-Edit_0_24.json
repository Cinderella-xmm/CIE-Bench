      "question": "Do the enhanced flowers exhibit vivid but natural color gradients and soft, detailed textures without visible artifacts like oversharpening or color smearing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers display vibrant colors with smooth gradients between shades. The textures appear soft and well-detailed, which suggests a careful enhancement that avoids common artifacts such as oversharpening or color smearing. This visual assessment is based on the natural depiction of each flower's color transition and the absence of harsh lines or irregularities.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the shovel and watering can visually consistent with antique metal objects, showing realistic surface textures like tarnish and reflections without unnatural gloss or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shovel and watering can have textures that resemble aged metal. There is visible tarnish and subtle reflections that suggest an authentic metal surface, rather than a glossy or distorted appearance. This conclusion comes from observing the natural-looking surface irregularities typical of antique metal objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the vine motif background subtly integrated into the image without obscuring primary elements or causing visible layering artifacts at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features vine motifs in the background that blend seamlessly with the overall composition. The motifs do not overshadow the primary elements, such as the flowers or gardening tools, and there are no apparent layering artifacts visible at the edges. This assessment is based on the harmonious integration of the vine motifs, which complement rather than detract from the main focus of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the ornate leafy frame around the blank header have smooth, continuous shapes with natural leaf contours and consistent lighting, without geometric distortions or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leafy frame surrounding the blank header exhibits smooth, continuous shapes along with leaf contours that appear natural. The lighting is consistent across the frame, and there are no signs of geometric distortions, such as unnatural bending or clipping. These observations are based on the continuous flow and realistic depiction of each leaf element.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the woman's right hand show five correctly shaped fingers with natural skin texture and grip posture, without extra digits or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the woman's right hand with five properly proportioned and shaped fingers. The skin texture looks natural, and the hand grip posture on the shovel is realistic with no extra digits or awkward bending. This conclusion arises from the anatomical accuracy and realistic depiction of the hand's interaction with the gardening tool.",
