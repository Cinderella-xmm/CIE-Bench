    "Question": "Q1: Are the muscle proportions of the player in red (player #24) exaggerated but still anatomically plausible without visible distortion or unnatural bulging?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the player in red exhibits exaggerated muscle proportions typical of stylized art, featuring enlarged limbs and a broad chest. The illustration enhances these features for visual impact, but maintains anatomical coherence seen in cartoon depictions, avoiding unnatural bulging that would detract from plausibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the uniform colors of both players retain natural color gradients and material textures despite increased vibrancy, without appearing oversaturated or flat?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the uniform colors of both players are vibrant, suited to stylized art. The representation maintains clear distinction of areas such as the helmet and jersey numbers. Despite the saturated colors, the texture maintains a simple gradient illustrating different sections, and does not convey flatness.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the team logos on both players' helmets and jerseys accurately rendered and properly aligned without deformation or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents team logos, like the cougar on the helmet, in a stylized form that prioritizes clarity and visual uniformity. These logos are clearly rendered without pixelation, and align appropriately with the helmet's and jersey's dimensions without deformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background behind the players stylistically enhanced but still coherent with the foreground, without sudden distortions or loss of detail in the crowd or field markings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is deliberately abstract and stylized, typical for illustrations or character art. This stylistic approach is coherent with the exaggerated foreground, sustaining visual unity without unexpected distortions such as mismatched crowd details or field markings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the limbs and body postures of both players maintain structural consistency with real-world biomechanics, even with exaggerated motion, without broken joints or floating limbs?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates the player in exaggerated motion, showing running posture typical in cartoon depictions, with normalized limb awareness despite exaggeration. No abnormalities like broken joint connections or floating limbs are visible, consistent with motion dynamics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the matte black collector's box with transparent lid visually consistent in material, lighting, and perspective, and does it surround the cards without introducing edge artifacts or lighting mismatches?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the collector's box with accurate matte material reflection, consistent perspective, and proper lighting that doesnâ€™t introduce artifacts. The box's construction is coherent in finish and surrounds the stylized card without mismatches between the box and card edges.",
    "answer": "Yes"
