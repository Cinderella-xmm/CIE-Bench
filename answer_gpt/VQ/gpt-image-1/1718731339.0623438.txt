    "Question": "Q1: Are all fine details such as spikes, rivets, and surface scratches on the armor clearly visible and undistorted after miniaturization?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is designed with a heavy and intricate suit of armor. Miniaturizing such detailed artwork can sometimes result in loss of clarity. However, in the image, the details such as spikes, rivets, and potential surface scratches appear to be clearly visible without distortion. This suggests careful attention to rendering these elements during the scale-down process.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the glass dome enclose the figure without visible seams, distortion, or unnatural refraction effects that alter the appearance of the armor?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears to be smoothly enclosing the armored figure. The dome does not display any visible seams or distortions that would typically alter the viewer's perception of the figure within. The clarity suggests proper rendering of the glass material to avoid unnatural refraction effects.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the cogwheels at the base fully connected to the foundation, with interlocking teeth and consistent size ratios, and no floating or disconnected parts?",
    "explanation": "At the base of the glass dome, the cogwheels are noted. They appear to be fully connected to the foundation and showcase interlocking teeth, which are essential for conveying functionality. The size ratios among the cogwheels seem consistent as well, with no indication of floating or disconnected parts.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the mechanical wings securely connected to the shoulder armor, matching the metal texture and spike design, and free of unnatural bends or misaligned joints?",
    "explanation": "The mechanical wings on the figure's shoulders in Image B are observed to be securely connected. They complement the same metallic texture and spike design as the rest of the armor, indicating a coherent design theme. There are no observable unnatural bends or misalignments, showing a meticulous attention to joint positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the copper pipes follow continuous paths along armor joints, maintain consistent diameter and smooth bends, and avoid intersecting with key armor components?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the copper pipes are designed to follow the contours of the armor. They maintain a consistent diameter and show smooth bends, enhancing the visual coherence of the armor. Additionally, these pipes do not intersect with major armor components, which would otherwise disrupt structural or aesthetic integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the brass orbs positioned at varying distances around the figure, not touching or clipping into the armor or dome, and displaying uniform material finish and lighting?",
    "explanation": "The brass orbs in Image B are placed around the figure, and their positioning shows an intentional arrangement at varying distances. They are not in contact with the armor or the glass dome, preventing any clipping issues. The orbs also exhibit a consistent material finish and lighting, matching the overall aesthetic of the figure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
