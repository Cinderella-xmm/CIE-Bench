      "question": "Does the unfurled scroll form of the map maintain smooth, continuous curvature without jagged edges or distorted grid lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the map is depicted as a scroll that appears unfurled. The curvature of the scroll is smooth, and there are no visible jagged edges or distorted grid lines that disrupt its appearance. The depiction is consistent with artistic portrayals of ancient maps, which often emphasize a clean and continuous rolled edge for aesthetic purposes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the spokes of the ship's wheel evenly spaced, structurally intact, and consistent in thickness and metallic texture with the original compass material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship’s wheel is depicted with spokes that are evenly spaced and consistent in terms of thickness, maintaining a cohesive visual structure. The wheel effectively mimics the metallic texture and pattern detail seen in the compass of Image A, giving them a harmonious appearance that resonates with the intended vintage aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the silhouettes of the explorers clearly distinguishable, proportionally small relative to the map scale, and placed along plausible travel paths without overlapping key geographical labels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The explorers in Image B are presented as silhouettes which, while smaller relative to the map itself, maintain discernible shapes with no significant distortion. They appear to be walking along logical paths guided by the map’s context, aligning with historical exploration routes, and do not interfere with or obscure significant map details like labels or outlines of countries.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the typography aligned with the vintage aesthetic, free from pixelation or blurring, and positioned so that it does not obscure major elements such as the compass or continental outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typography suits the vintage aesthetic through its classic font style and consistent coloring. There is no evident pixelation or blurring, maintaining high readability and clarity. The text is well-positioned, ensuring that it does not cover crucial parts of the image, such as the compass or areas of the map that show continental outlines.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the red dotted lines form continuous, non-overlapping paths across the map that align with known historical exploration routes and avoid cutting through landmasses or key symbols?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red dotted lines in Image B form coherent paths that weave through the map without overlapping excessively or crossing through the land masses inappropriately. This presentation aligns with expected exploration routes used in historical map depictions, maintaining an organized pathway that respects the map’s geographical layout and avoids any obstruction of key map features.",
