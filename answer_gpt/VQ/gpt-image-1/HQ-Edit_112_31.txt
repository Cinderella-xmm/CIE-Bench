    "Question": "Q1: Is the horseâ€™s head enlarged proportionally so that facial features like the eyes and muzzle remain clearly defined and undistorted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the plush horse has a head much larger than proportional to its body, which is typical for a chibi or plush toy. The eyes are oversized and cartoon-like with exaggerated features, typical of plush toys. The muzzle is minimalistic, not distorted, and clearly defined, maintaining a consistent style of toy design.
