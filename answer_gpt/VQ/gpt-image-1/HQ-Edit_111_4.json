    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the cactus arms show smooth, continuous segmentation without abrupt breaks or distorted joints, and do the glowing orbs at their ends appear naturally attached and aligned with the limb direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus features octopus-like arms with glowing orbs at the ends. The arms appear to be smoothly segmented without abrupt breaks, indicating a continuous structure. The glowing orbs are positioned at the ends of the arms, and they seem naturally attached, aligning with the curvature of each limb. The overall structure appears cohesive, which ensures that the limbs and the glowing orbs form a natural continuation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the iridescent scales evenly distributed across the cactus surface, following the original rib pattern without visible seams, repetitive textures, or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cactus in Image B is covered with iridescent scales. These scales are evenly distributed across the surface of the transformed cactus, forming a uniform pattern that follows the curves of the arms. They do not have visible seams, repetitive textures, or unnatural color shifts, which suggests a coherent design that aligns well with the surface rib pattern of the cactus.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the crystal spine rise vertically from the base of the cactus with consistent facets and internal clarity, maintaining alignment with the original trunk and showing no signs of digital clipping or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal spine in Image B rises vertically from the center of the cactus structure. It appears with consistent facets and maintains internal clarity throughout its length. It aligns well with the trunk, showing no signs of digital clipping or edge artifacts, providing a seamless integration with the rest of the cactus design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bioluminescent tendrils positioned along the cactusâ€™s surface in a coherent, organic pattern, with consistent thickness and spacing, and do they cast soft glows that match the ambient lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bioluminescent tendrils are distributed across the surface of the transformed cactus in Image B. These tendrils are positioned in a coherent, organic pattern with consistent thickness and spacing throughout. They cast soft glows that harmonize well with the ambient lighting, contributing to an overall realistic portrayal in the environment shown.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the base of the transformed cactus fully grounded in the sand, casting a shadow that aligns with the light source and does not show floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the transformed cactus appears grounded in the sand. It casts a shadow that aligns with the light source visible in the environment, ensuring that there are no signs of floating or disconnected sections. This grounding provides stability to the structure within the scene, enhancing the cohesiveness and realism of the image.",
