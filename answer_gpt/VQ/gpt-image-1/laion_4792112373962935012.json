      "question": "Does the lime wedge retain its natural green hue and textured rind, with no visible distortion or pixelation, even after being shaped into a smiling cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime wedge appears as a cartoonish representation with a smiling face. While the narrative suggests a shape akin to a cap, the lime wedge depicted retains a simplified form characteristic of animated graphics, rather than maintaining its natural appearance. The lime is stylized to integrate into the cartoon theme, thereby stepping away from retaining any authentic texture or hue that would be found on an actual lime - eliminating any realistic depiction of a textured rind or natural hue. This stylization is common in cartoon representations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two ice cubes positioned as eyes clearly defined as solid, translucent cubes with sharp edges and no deformation, and do they sit naturally within the liquid without appearing to float unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ice cubes are stylized to function as eyes in a character-like animated form. Though they mimic the cube shape, these representations diverge from natural translucency or sharp edges observed in real cubes. The ice cubes appear integrated into the animated glass with no cues that indicate natural floating dynamics seen in liquids; instead, they are intentionally positioned to resemble eyes, thus affecting their three-dimensional naturalness and position within the liquid.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the sugar rim along the glass edge uniformly granular and continuous, with no visible breaks, smearing, or artificial coloring that disrupts the natural appearance of salt/sugar crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the sugar rim as a stylized border fitting the animated theme, lacking individual granular detail akin to real sugar or salt crystals. This character representation focuses on delivering visual simplicity and efficacy of cartoon aesthetics, therefore not capturing the complex textural subtleties found in natural sugar rims.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sombrero and maracas have consistent material textures (e.g., woven straw, wood grain, reflective beads), correct scale relative to the glass, and proper shadows that match the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sombrero and maracas as graphic, colorful elements embodying playful styles over realistic material textures. The scale is artistically balanced within the cartoon character proportions, allowing them to supplement the 'fiesta' theme effectively. These elements fit into the animated character design with no realistic shadows or lighting, emphasizing humorous, simplified textures rather than accurate straw or wood effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the confetti pieces varied in color and shape, with soft edges and subtle shadows, and do they appear to lie on the surface without floating or overlapping unrealistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The confetti in Image B displays vibrant singular colors without subtle shadow depiction or soft edge modeling, consistent with animated styles. They float amid the background rather than settling naturally. This presentation accentuates the lively celebratory atmosphere rather than functional realism, playing into the theme's dynamism rather than physical proprietary attributes of confetti in real scenarios.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the text “Fiesta Time!” clearly visible, evenly spaced, and positioned at the top of the image without overlapping or distorting other elements, and does it have consistent stroke width and anti-aliasing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the text 'Fiesta Time!' in a prominent, clear position at the top of the image. It maintains even spacing, avoiding any overlap or distortion with other components; the stroke width fits within visual standards for shimmering consistency. This display of typography ensures that the festive expression remains distinctly visible against the thematic background, following suited anti-aliasing norms to complement the animated design.",
