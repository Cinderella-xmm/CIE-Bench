      "question": "Are the body proportions and movements in the line art consistent and natural throughout the four frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the line art presents a sequence of tennis movements. The body proportions appear balanced, with consistent limb lengths and likely realistic muscle tension that would appear in different stages of movement. The feet positioning and knee bends correspond to realistic tennis action sequences, reflecting knowledge of tennis stances and practices. Therefore, the body proportions and movements are consistent and natural.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the tennis racket and the ball retain their realistic textures and details without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B provides a simplified, monochrome interpretation of the tennis racket and ball. While the textures and details of a real racket and ball are naturally lost in such a style, the line art maintains the shapes and proportions typical for these objects, without introducing any unexpected or unnatural features. This type of art inherently lacks texture detail, but clarity is retained without artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand's position and grip on the racket depicted naturally and ergonomically in each of the four frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B's sequential frames, the depiction of hands gripping the racket appears varied and shows typical grip changes when moving from preparation to follow-through motions in tennis. This is consistent with general sports mechanics, displaying an understanding of how players adjust their grip for different shots. Each grip looks viable for its corresponding tennis action, suggesting ergonomic correctness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the removal of the background and the application of monochrome colors preserve visual clarity without causing any distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the removal of extraneous background details and the use of monochrome coloring simplify the visualization of the action sequence without compromising essential details necessary for understanding the tennis motion. While intricate backgrounds and colors provide depth and realism, their absence here does not lead to visual distortion; instead, it focuses attention on the action sequence, preserving clarity.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sequence of actions from preparation to follow-through in the clean line art style visually coherent and believable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sequence in Image B proceeds from preparation through to follow-through. Each step aligns correctly with expected tennis mechanics, showing planned stance progression, which corresponds with tennis instructional motions known from the sport. The consistent representation of movement through these stages indicates a coherent understanding of sports motion in artwork.",
