      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style figure appear to seamlessly emerge from the kayak without any visible breaks or unnatural intersections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure is seen within the kayak. The integration of the figure into the kayak appears smooth and natural. The figure's arms are holding a paddle, which aligns well with the kayak's contours, indicating that it was carefully placed to fit the kayak without any noticeable breaks or awkward intersections, which one would expect in high-quality digital rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or artifacts present around the edges where the chibi figure meets the kayak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the meeting edges between the chibi figure and the kayak are smooth and continuous. There are no visible seams, glitches, or pixelation, indicating that the editing was done with care to maintain visual coherence, avoiding any artifacts that would typically arise from poor editing techniques.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the chibi figure relative to the kayak appear realistic and maintain structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the chibi figure in relation to the kayak are consistent with the typical style of a chibi figure, which is often characterized by exaggerated features like a large head. While the figure's proportions differ from realistic human dimensions, they are consistent with the stylized look of chibi design. The figure fits within the kayak in a way that aligns well with what is expected for this art style.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the Polaroid photograph holding the scene appear naturally integrated into the overall composition without any distortion or unnatural placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Polaroid photograph in Image B is being held competently in a hand, aligned naturally with the scene behind it. The edges of the photograph align with the hand and the overall scene, creating a believable interaction without any skewing or awkward positioning, which suggests skillful editing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the materials and textures of the kayak and skateboard remained consistent and undistorted after the addition of the chibi figure and Polaroid frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In reviewing Image B, the textures and colors on the kayak and skateboard retain their natural appearance, consistent with Image A. The shadows and lighting on these objects appear undistorted, maintaining their realism even with the introduction of the chibi figure and the hand holding the Polaroid frame, implying no degradation in texture quality.",
