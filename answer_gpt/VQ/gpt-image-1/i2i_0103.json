      "question": "Have the brushstrokes added to the sofa preserved its structural integrity without causing distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa is modified with Van Gogh-style brushstrokes. This style introduces swirling and textured strokes typical of Van Gogh's work, which can add a sense of movement and texture. Despite these stylistic changes, the form of the sofa is still recognizable as the brushstrokes conform to the basic shapes and contours. This indicates that its structural integrity is maintained without significant distortion or unnatural textures, as the overall proportions and silhouette remain consistent with real-world sofas.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the wall, including the framed painting, appear naturally integrated with the rest of the room after the style conversion, without any broken geometric shapes or lost fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall and framed painting are reimagined in a Van Gogh-style, characterized by swirling brushstrokes and vibrant colors. This style tends to accentuate the texture while maintaining basic geometric shapes and the frame's structure. The painting retains its landscape theme, and the overall integration of these elements with the room does not disrupt the spatial arrangement or cause broken geometric shapes. The continuity of colors and patterns suggest natural integration, aligning with the room's theme.",

      "question": "Are the plant's leaves depicted with Van Gogh-style brushstrokes while still retaining a recognizable and plausible appearance without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plant leaves are painted with the Van Gogh style consisting of dynamic and textured brushstrokes. These strokes add complexity to the leaves while preserving their natural shape and arrangement. They do not introduce artifacts or distortions that would make the appearance implausible, as the identity of the plant remains clear and accurate to its real-world counterpart. The structure and shape of the leaves remain intact, supporting a plausible depiction.",

      "question": "Has the side table and lamp been converted to fit the Van Gogh style while preserving their realistic proportions and physical logic, avoiding any distortion or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side table and lamp are transformed into Van Gogh-style, featuring bold and expressive brushwork. Despite this stylistic conversion, the proportions and physical logic of these objects are maintained; the table retains its function and the lamp embodies typical design characteristics, such as its shade and base. The fine details are modeled through the texture of the strokes without distorting their logical dimensions.",

      "question": "Do all elements in the room maintain a harmonious and plausible arrangement in Van Gogh style, ensuring no disruption in the spatial relationships among objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the room's elements—sofa, wall, painting, plant, table, and lamp—are all converted to Van Gogh's style with the characteristic energetic brushstrokes and vibrant colors. This transformation maintains harmony among the objects, as their arrangement and spatial relationship from Image A are preserved. The stylistic changes enhance the aesthetic cohesion without disrupting the plausible configuration seen in normal environments. The balance and positioning of objects mimic reality within the artistic expression of Van Gogh's techniques.",
