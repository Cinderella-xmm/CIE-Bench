      "question": "Does the glass dome surrounding the eagle exhibit natural transparency, smooth curvature, and realistic light refraction without distorting the eagle or background clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B displays a smooth curvature which is typical for such domes. It exhibits transparency that allows clear visibility of the eagle and the cloud formations inside without distortion. The dome realistically captures light reflections on its surface, which adds to the authenticity typically expected from glass. Thus, the glass dome shows natural transparency and smooth curvature without distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the miniature clouds beneath the eagle’s wings three-dimensional, properly lit, and textured to match natural cloud formations without appearing artificial or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature clouds in Image B have a three-dimensional appearance with curling forms that mimic natural clouds. They are properly lit, casting soft shadows, which adds to their realistic texture and depth. The alignment and texture don’t appear misaligned or artificial when considering how decorative items often stylize natural elements for visual appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold leaf detail on the miniature clouds applied in a way that shows fine, reflective metallic texture without disrupting the cloud’s natural appearance or creating harsh highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold leaf detail enhances the clouds with a reflective texture typical of metallic finishes. The application is delicate, ensuring it complements the cloud's appearance rather than overpowering or disrupting the visual. The highlights are soft, without harshness, maintaining the decorative aesthetic and coherence with the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the dark wood base have natural wood texture, proper polish finish, and clearly engraved text, and is it positioned stably beneath the dome without appearing disconnected or disproportionately sized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dark wood base in Image B has visible grain and texture, indicative of polished wood, adding natural appeal. The engraving is clear and prominent, enhancing the base's craftsmanship. The base supports the dome stably, and is proportionally sized to complement the dome, ensuring the display appears connected.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brass compass roses evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and rendered with realistic metallic texture and scale relative to the dome and base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brass compass roses in Image B are correctly spaced around the dome, ensuring visual balance. Their shaping is precise, consistent with the classic compass rose design. The metallic texture is realistic, adding to their authenticity. Relative to the dome and base, their size is appropriate, ensuring harmony within the display.",
