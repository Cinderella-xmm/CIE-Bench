      "question": "Are the color blocks on the comforter smoothly blended and textured to resemble natural fur, with no visible stitching artifacts or abrupt edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color blocks on the comforter are smoothly blended and have a fur-like texture. This is achieved by the naturalistic and soft appearance of the color blocks without visible stitching or abrupt edges, emulating the texture of animal fur. The visual effect is consistent with what one might expect from fur materials, rather than fabric which typically displays stitching lines.",

      "question": "Do the ear-shaped pillows have a natural, upright shape with soft leaf trims that appear securely and organically attached without floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ear-shaped elements are added to the pillow area in the form of fox ears. These ears look natural and upright, featuring leaf-shaped trims attached to the ears. The leaves are securely affixed without any misalignment and do not show floating or jagged edges, suggesting a seamless integration into the design.",

      "question": "Are the branch-like legs thin, curved, and textured like natural wood, and do they connect correctly to the bed base without appearing broken or disconnected?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features legs that resemble tree branches, which are thin and slightly curved, exhibiting a natural wood-like texture. These legs appear properly connected to the bed base without any visual breaks or disconnects, maintaining the illusion of organic wooden legs being part of the bed structure.",

      "question": "Does the red tail extend from the comforter with a rounded, fluffy shape and soft texture, and does it not intersect or clip through the fabric beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red tail extends from the comforter and is designed with a rounded, fluffy texture that resembles a fox's tail. The tail does not intersect or clip through the fabric beneath it, appearing naturally placed and fitting well with the overall composition of the bed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows and lighting on the ears, tail, and branch legs consistent with the ambient light source in the room and do they align with the original bed's position and surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadows on the ears, tail, and legs in Image B appear consistent with the ambient light source within the room. They align well with the original bed's position and surrounding objects, such as the lamp and desk, which suggests a coherent integration of these elements with regard to the room's lighting conditions.",
