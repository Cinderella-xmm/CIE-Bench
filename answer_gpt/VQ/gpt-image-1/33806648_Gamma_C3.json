    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the skeletal wing-like extensions emerge naturally from the rock arch's edges without gaps, floating sections, or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skeletal wing-like extensions appear to emerge from the body of a creature instead of directly from the rock arch. The wings themselves possess detailed structural anatomy, with pronounced skeletal forms characteristic of fantastical dragon designs. Analyzing the image through common sense and world knowledge about biology and fantasy artwork indicates that these wings are intended to belong to the creature and not the rock arch itself, leading to the conclusion that they do not emerge naturally from the arch's structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the crystalline growths along the arch’s curve textured and colored to blend with the surrounding rock, avoiding excessive gloss or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There's a noticeable augmentation of luminous crystal-like formations on the creature's back in Image B. These formations do not align with the arch’s curve but are distinct elements related to the creature. The colors of the crystals are vibrant blues with glowing effects, which contrast sharply against the muted, earthy tones of the surrounding rock. Given this contrast and the fantastical glow of the crystals, they do not blend seamlessly with the nearby rock texture.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the glowing veins across the surface follow natural mineral-like patterns and have soft, continuous light emission without jagged edges or blocky artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the glowing veins are part of the creature's design and feature continuous, well-defined patterns that resemble veins of energy rather than mineral. The glow is smooth and consistent, typical of high-quality digital rendering, without noticeable irregularities or artifacts, indicating the veins are intentionally designed to add an otherworldly element to the creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the runic symbols on the inner surface of the arch carved into the rock with consistent depth and shadow, matching the texture of natural erosion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the runic symbols are inscribed on the creature and not on the rock arch itself. These symbols are illuminated and appear distinct from natural erosion patterns one would expect from carvings in rock. They exhibit uniform depth and glow, deviating clearly from naturalistic textures of geology.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the radiant orb emit light that matches the ambient lighting direction and creates realistic soft shadows and reflections on adjacent rock surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The radiant orb is positioned on the creature’s chest within the edited image (Image B) and emits a warm glow. The light of the orb feels consistent with the overall ambient lighting – it radiates outward, creating shadows that adhere to realistic lighting physics aimed at producing soft shadows and understandable reflections on nearby surfaces, fitting the design's high fantasy tone.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the ground textures, cracks, and soil near the base of the arch preserved and not obscured or distorted by the added elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the ground textures and soil around the arch appear stable, maintaining the original paths and natural erosion seen in the unaltered Image A. The inserted creature integrates without distorting the existing terrain features, showcasing the edited elements are layered with mindful integration within the depicted environment.",
