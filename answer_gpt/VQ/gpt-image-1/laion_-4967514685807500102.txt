    "Question": "Q1: Does the shrimp character’s arm and hand have five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and are they attached at a logical joint point without deforming the shrimp’s body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp character has a simplified cartoon design typical of animated styles, commonly not adhering to realistic human anatomy. Instead of having five fingers, cartoon characters often have fewer fingers, usually three or four, for simplicity and ease of animation. The arm and hand of the shrimp in the image do not have five fingers, and although they are attached at a point on the shrimp's body, the attachment is stylized rather than realistic, given that the shrimp is anthropomorphized.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the chef’s hat cast a subtle shadow on the shrimp and have visible fabric texture and creases consistent with real-world materials?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon depiction, and the chef’s hat lacks realistic shading or texture detail because it is part of a simplified comic style. The hat appears as a smooth, solid shape without detailed fabric textures or creases, common in stylized illustrations where emphasis is on bold outlines and clear shapes rather than realistic rendering.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the hand gripping the lemon slice positioned with fingers properly curved and spaced, and does the lemon retain its natural wedge shape and surface texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp’s hand holding the lemon slice is designed with cartoon simplicity, and the fingers do not have realistic curvature or spacing as found in natural human anatomy. Similarly, the lemon slice retains a stylized shape with a clear outline but lacks the detailed texture of a real lemon wedge, focusing instead on bold and simple shapes typical of cartoons.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the motion lines aligned with the shrimp’s direction of movement and do the herb particles appear to be dispersing from a logical origin point near the shrimp?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the use of motion lines around the shrimp and the scattering herb particles are stylized to create an impression of movement and action. The motion lines do complement the shrimp's movement and the herbs appear to disperse from a position near the shrimp, aligning with visual cues that are coherent for comic-style art aiming to depict lively action.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the shrimp tails arranged in a stable, gravity-consistent pile with overlapping layers and no floating or suspended pieces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration exaggerates physical elements typical of comic style, such as the shrimp character sitting on a pile of shrimp tails. However, this artistic license may create an image where the tails are not realistically stacked with adherence to gravity, but rather serve to visually emphasize the triumph of the shrimp character, lacking realistic layering or gravity consistency.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all text elements clearly legible, positioned without overlapping key visual elements, and rendered with consistent stroke thickness and style?",
    "explanation": "The text elements in Image B are clear and legible, positioned in speech bubbles that avoid overlapping key visual elements. The fonts and lines appear consistent, which aligns with standard comic style formatting where text is meant to be easily readable and integrated smoothly into the artwork’s overall design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
