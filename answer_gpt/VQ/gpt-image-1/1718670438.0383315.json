      "question": "Does the glass bell jar surrounding the robot have clear, smooth surfaces with natural reflections and refractions that do not distort the robot’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a glass bell jar with visually smooth surfaces, as indicated by the clear reflections and accurate refractions of light across its surface. This results in the robot's structure being seen clearly without any visible distortion, suggesting high-quality glass typical in display cases that do not alter or warp the object they encase.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the pedestal under the robot properly aligned, proportionally sized, and made of materials consistent with the steampunk theme (e.g., brass, copper) without visible seams or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pedestal in Image B is centered under the robot and appears to be proportionate in size, providing a stable base. It is depicted in steampunk-appropriate materials such as brass or copper, recognizable from its metallic finish and warm color. The pedestal shows no visible seams or deformations, suggesting a high-quality craftmanship.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the miniature clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils positioned at a plausible scale and orientation around the robot, with natural textures and no floating or disconnected parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils are seen clearly positioned around the robot. They appear to match the scale of the robot, maintaining consistency expected in a scaled-down model. The orientation follows natural alignment, visibly textured to match metal, and no parts appear floating or disconnected, indicating careful positioning within the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the glowing orbs emit a soft, localized glow that blends naturally with the ambient lighting and does not produce unnatural light artifacts or overexposed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing orbs in Image B emit light that appears soft and consistent with the ambient scene lighting. The glow is localized around the orbs without sharp transitions or flaring, contributing to a natural blend. There are no noticeable light artifacts or overexposed areas evident, suggesting a well-balanced integration of lighting in the composition.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the etched patterns on the base of the glass jar sharp, detailed, and stylistically coherent with the steampunk aesthetic, without blurring or irregular lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The etched patterns on the base of the glass jar in Image B appear well-defined and sharp, as indicated by the clear lines and precise detailing observable. The style is consistent with the intricate designs typical in steampunk aesthetics, with no blurring or irregular lines, indicating meticulous craftsmanship in the artwork.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the rusted metal background match the color and texture of the robot’s materials and blend seamlessly without visible edges or tonal inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features rusted metal tones that complement the robot's material, with colors and textures harmonizing with the brown and bronze hues typical in steampunk themes. The seamless blending and absence of visible edges or tonal inconsistencies indicate a smooth transition in the image's backdrop, supporting a coherent design scheme.",
