      "question": "Does the arched typography sit correctly above the Opera House without distorting its shape or creating visual inconsistencies in scale and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arched typography in Image B is positioned high above the Opera House, creating a sense of spatial arrangement that does not interfere with the architectural lines of the landmark.

      "question": "Does the capybaraâ€™s hand holding the drink have five fingers with natural spacing, ergonomic curvature, and realistic texture without distortion or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara's hand is depicted with a stylized and cartoonish quality, typical of the overall artwork style. The fingers appear simplified and do not explicitly show five distinct fingers, as might be expected in a realistic depiction. However, this seems intentional in the design context, thus avoiding distortion or extra digits while maintaining an artistically coherent appearance.",

      "question": "Do the lighting and reflections on the capybara, the drink, and the water surface align consistently with the direction of the sunset in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunset casts a warm glow consistent with the lighting on the capybara, the drink, and the water surface. The gradient in the sky and reflections on the water align with the light direction suggested by the sunset, maintaining a coherent lighting scheme across the image. This alignment contributes to the realism and aesthetic appeal of the scene, indicating careful attention to detail in the lighting effect.",
