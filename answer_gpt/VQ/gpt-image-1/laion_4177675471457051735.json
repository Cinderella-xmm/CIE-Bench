      "question": "Does the dress material appear as a smooth, richly textured deep velvet without visible artifacts like unnatural sheen or inconsistent surface patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress material appears to be a deep velvet based on its consistent, rich texture and absence of any unnatural sheen or inconsistent surface patterns. This is observable from the even coloration and texture resembling what one would expect from high-quality velvet fabric seen in historical or formal portraiture. The visual cues combined with knowledge of velvet characteristics suggest a well-rendered material.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the earrings and any headpiece elements composed of spherical, uniformly shaped pearls with natural light reflections and no distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the earrings and headpiece are adorned with pearls that appear spherical and uniformly shaped. The natural light reflections are consistent with the surface characteristics of real pearls, and there is no evidence of distorted geometry, which aligns with the known qualities of accurately depicted pearls in artworks and photographs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hairstyle rendered as a voluminous, intricately styled updo with coherent strands and no floating or broken hair sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hairstyle in Image B is styled as a voluminous updo, which appears intricate with coherent strands. It lacks floating or broken sections that would suggest poor rendering. This matches the common expectation of hairstyles in classical portraits or well-executed photographs where attention to detail in hair styling is emphasized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of detailed tapestries with warm earth tones that blend naturally with the figure without visible edges or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background that appears to be detailed tapestries in warm earth tones, which blend seamlessly with the figure. The absence of visible edges or inconsistent lighting indicates a natural and cohesive interaction between the figure and the backdrop, typical in well-rendered artistic environments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features, neck, and shoulders proportionally aligned and free from deformation or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the face is blurred, the visible parts such as the neck and shoulders appear to be proportionally aligned and free from deformation or unnatural stretching. The alignment is consistent with that in traditional portrait images where proportionality is maintained to reflect realism.",
