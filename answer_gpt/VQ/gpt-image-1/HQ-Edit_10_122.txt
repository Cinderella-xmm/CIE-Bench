    "Question": "Q1: Does the patterned textile on the character’s top display coherent geometric shapes, consistent color gradients, and natural fabric-like texture without visible distortions or repeating digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the patterned textile on the character's top features distinct geometric shapes with vivid, contrasting colors. The patterns appear to be inspired by traditional African designs, which often include intricate geometric motifs. While the overall pattern is clear, the texture in Image B is stylized and resembles a painted mural rather than actual fabric, resulting in a lack of fabric-like texture or consistent color gradients that would naturally occur on cloth. This indicates the presence of digital art effects rather than natural fabric characteristics.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the tribal motifs on the gold earrings and necklaces clearly defined, proportionally accurate, and free from distorted edges or unrealistic surface reflections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the earrings and necklaces show clear tribal motifs with bold outlines, fitting harmoniously with the overall stylized and abstract aesthetic. However, due to the stylized nature of the image, the characteristics such as distorted edges or unrealistic reflections are overshadowed by the art style rather than representing photorealistic jewelry features. The motifs are visible and distinctly separated, but they are adapted to fit a painted concept rather than realistic proportion and detail accuracy.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the abstracted umbrellas in the background maintain plausible proportions and spatial relationships, without overlapping or floating inconsistently relative to the market stalls?",
    "explanation": "The abstracted umbrellas in Image B are depicted with a very flat, mural-like aesthetic, typical of illustrative styles. Given the artistic nature, while the spatial relationship is coherent within the painted context, the lack of depth perception makes them appear more symbolic rather than true-to-life. Despite this, they do not appear to overlap unnaturally with the market stalls or float inconsistently relative to other objects, maintaining a balanced composition that blends well with the background.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the musical notes distributed evenly and positioned along plausible trajectories around the character’s head, without sharp breaks or abrupt cutoffs in their paths?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the musical notes are interspersed around the character's head, aligned with the illustrative style of the artwork. They follow a pattern that suggests movement and sound within the view of the canvas, without any abrupt cutoffs or awkward positioning. The even distribution complements the rhythm and aesthetic of the image, making it visually appealing and coherent within the context.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the character’s right hand show five fingers with correct proportions, natural curvature, and realistic skin texture, without any missing, duplicated, or misshapen digits?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character's right hand is depicted in an abstract style consistent with the rest of the canvas. The hand shows five fingers that follow a unique pattern and form fitting the artistic style, with tribal motifs accentuating the fingers. While the natural curvature of fingers might not be depicted in a photorealistic manner, considering the art's tribal and painted theme, this stylization does not misrepresent the presence or number of fingers. However, realistic skin texture is not portrayed, aligning with the overall artwork's stylized theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"
