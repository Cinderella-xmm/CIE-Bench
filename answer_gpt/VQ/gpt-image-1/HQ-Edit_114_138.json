      "question": "Does the silk robe exhibit natural fabric texture with consistent gold highlights and floral patterns that follow realistic light interaction and material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silk robe has a uniform texture with floral patterns that are stylized rather than realistic, lacking the natural fabric texture and light interaction seen in real silk material. The illustration of the robe does not capture the nuances of realistic lighting or material properties, making it appear more flat and illustrative.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the book’s shape preserved with realistic page layers and depth, avoiding broken edges, inconsistent thickness, or floating components that disrupt its structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book's shape appears more like a stylized illustration where the depth and page layers are simplified. The edges and overall structure are consistent for the illustrative style, but they lack the realistic depth and layering seen in a physical book. There are no broken edges or floating components; it's coherent within its artistic design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bookshelf designs integrated without altering the original shelf alignment, spacing, or wood grain texture, maintaining visual credibility and structural rationality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelf design maintains the alignment and spacing typical of a stylized illustration. The details like wood grain texture are absent, focusing more on a simplified and decorative depiction suitable for the style of a cartoon or graphic art rather than realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bookmark panels appear correctly inserted between the book’s pages, with proper scale, orientation, and connection to the book, avoiding floating or misaligned placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any bookmark panels between the book’s pages, as the depicted design is more artistic and illustrative without such elements. Therefore, it does not involve any issues of scale, orientation, or placement as no bookmarks are present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features, particularly around the eyes and mouth, proportionally accurate and free from exaggerated or distorted shapes that compromise visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not present the facial features such as eyes and mouth due to the focus area being blurred. However, based on the stylization of the rest of the image, had there been facial features, they would likely have been rendered in a similarly stylized and illustrative manner rather than with realistic proportions.",
