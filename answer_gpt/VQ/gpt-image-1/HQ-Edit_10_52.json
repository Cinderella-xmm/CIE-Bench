    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the woman's face and body maintain natural proportions without exaggerated or distorted features such as uneven eyes, misplaced limbs, or unnatural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's body silhouette is simplified due to the artistic style applied. Her features are depicted in a stylized manner consistent with the chibi design, which usually embraces proportional adjustments but does not indicate distortions, thus allowing for an understanding that the artistic style respects balance within its abstraction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the dress enlarged proportionally without breaking their natural shape or causing jagged edges, and do the gold highlights blend seamlessly into the fabric texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents floral patterns as an element within cartoony and chibi graphics, featuring smoother transitions and flat coloring with visible boundaries. The gold highlights are integrated into the design, complementing the color scheme but differing from realistic textile blending from world knowledge. The interpretation respects the intended style rather than aiming for realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the radiant hues applied to the dress appear smooth and evenly distributed without visible color bleeding, unnatural glow artifacts, or disrupted fabric texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Hues in the edited image maintain an even distribution across the animated form, with flat gradient transitions typical of cartoon-style rendering, which do not exhibit artifacts like color bleed associated with realistic blend effects. World knowledge of chibi and cartoon animation supports the conclusion that the execution is aligned with its creative simplicity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the abstract bamboo shadows align with the existing light source and cast believable depth without appearing detached, inconsistent, or overlapping incorrectly with the figure or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "World knowledge about shadows indicates they should complement light sources. In Image B, bamboo shadows maintain alignment with the scene's lighting, consistent with stylized depiction, holding cohesiveness in representation and not illustrating disruption or incorrect overlap across elements, with depth perception adapting by style limits.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bamboo-shaped writing panel positioned naturally within the scene, with smooth edges and watercolor motifs that match the surrounding textures and do not exhibit harsh lines or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The writing panel in Image B adopts a creative presentation with watercolor motifs effectively fused with surrounding textures, pointing out cohesive design typically seen in intentional stylistic portrayals. Its integration respects the artistic consistency sought in illustrative depictions, marked by smooth lines and complementary design motifs.",
