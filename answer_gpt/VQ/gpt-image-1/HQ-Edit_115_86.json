      "question": "Does the tutu maintain a balanced, layered structure with no visible warping or collapsed sections that suggest digital distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tutu on the illustrated ballerina shows a consistent and well-layered structure. The visual representation of the tutu maintains its circular shape and exhibits a uniform layering, characteristic of a well-designed tutu in an illustration. Observing the drawing style, the tutu is designed to convey depth and volume, indicating a balanced structure free from digital distortion, such as warping or collapsing of sections.",

      "question": "Are the glitter elements seamlessly blended into the tutu and bodice, showing natural variation in size and brightness without pixelation or unnatural clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates glitter elements integrated into the tutu and bodice, providing a sparkling effect. These elements are consistently placed and show a natural variation in size and brightness, reflecting a smooth blend without obvious pixelation or clumping. In the context of digital illustrations, glitter is often stylized to enhance the visual appeal, and in Image B, it appears professionally composed.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background gradient smooth and continuous, with no visible banding or abrupt color shifts that separate it from the subjectâ€™s silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gradient background behind the illustrated ballerina is designed to be smooth and continuous. The gradient transitions subtly across the backdrop, enhancing the main subject without interferences like banding or abrupt color shifts that would disturb the silhouette's integration into the scene.",

      "question": "Are the blank message areas fully opaque and aligned with the image plane, with no visible edge artifacts or texture disruption beneath them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blank message areas in Image B are fully opaque and effectively aligned within the created space. They seamlessly fit within the illustration, avoiding any edge artifacts or texture disruptions beneath them, which would be indicative of poor layering or alignment in digital work. The message areas maintain their intended function without distracting visual errors.",

      "question": "Do the floral motifs along the borders stay within the frame boundaries and maintain consistent scale and orientation without intersecting the ballerina or floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes floral motifs strategically placed along the borders, maintaining their position within frame boundaries. These motifs maintain a consistent scale and are orientated to complement the illustration without intersecting the ballerina or floor, preserving visual clarity and cohesion within the artwork.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina's hands are drawn with attention to anatomical detail, showing exactly five fingers each. The fingers exhibit natural curvature and spacing, typical of stylized illustrations, and there are no extra or fused digits, demonstrating accuracy in anatomy within the artwork style.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustrated ballerina in Image B demonstrates the correct positioning of both feet on pointe. The depiction includes natural arches and toes, suitable for figures in ballet stance. The supporting leg is drawn aligned correctly to support the posture without unnatural bending, showcasing a realistic portrayal in alignment with the stylistic depiction.",
