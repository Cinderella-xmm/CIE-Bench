    "Question": "Q2: Are the mane and tail composed of thin, curved porcelain-like structures that follow the natural flow of the original hair and are securely attached to the head and base of the tail without floating or breaking apart?",
    "explanation": "The mane and tail in Image B are visually elaborated as curved, porcelain-like strands that follow the natural flow of hair. These features appear smooth and are firmly attached to the unicorn's body, displaying structural integrity without any detached or floating elements. The design suggests a careful adaptation of real mane and tail into sculpture format using porcelain-like materials.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the horn form a continuous, symmetrical spiral shape made of reflective metallic material, originating from the same position as the original horn and maintaining proportional size relative to the head?",
    "explanation": "The horn in Image B maintains a continuous, symmetrical spiral pattern typical of unicorn horns and is made from a shiny, metallic material. It originates from the same anatomical position on the head as a typical horn and stays proportionally consistent with the unicorn's head size, demonstrating an accurate and creative translation into a polished, artistic feature.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the unicorn positioned on a flat, subtly textured stone base that contrasts with the original forest floor, with no visible remnants of trees, dirt, or foliage in the immediate surroundings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn is displayed on a flat stone base, which is subtly textured, consistent with exhibition pedestals seen in galleries or museums. The surroundings lack any natural elements such as trees, dirt, or foliage indicating a transition from a natural outdoor environment to a controlled indoor display. This setup focuses the viewer's attention on the sculpture itself, rather than its environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the lighting on the sculpture soft and directional, casting subtle highlights on the glazed surface and porcelain curls, consistent with indoor gallery illumination rather than outdoor moonlight?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in Image B comes across as soft and directional, providing subtle highlights and enhancing the reflective quality of the glazed surface and porcelain-like curls. This type of illumination is typically associated with indoor gallery settings, offering uniform light distribution, contrasting with the more diffuse and variable moonlight seen in outdoor environments.",
    "answer": "Yes"
