    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head disproportionately large compared to the body but without stretched or compressed facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image depicts a cartoonish, chibi-like figure, which is characterized by a disproportionately large head compared to the body. This style typically maintains the integrity of facial features, avoiding distortion or compression as seen in exaggerated cartoon styles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) clearly visible and proportionally accurate despite the enlarged head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual representation in Image B suggests a stylistic, chibi design where facial features are meant to be clear and proportionally accurate within the context of the design. However, the facial features are blurred, hence they are not visible at all.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the stripes on the shirt maintain consistent width, alignment, and color accuracy across the collar and chest area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character's shirt features vibrant, evenly spaced stripes, which are consistent in width and alignment across the collar and chest area. The color accuracy appears to be maintained consistently across the shirt.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the surface of the figure appear smooth and reflective, with no visible texture artifacts or rough edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a chibi-style figure whose outline and surface are smooth and appear reflective. The absence of any texture artifacts or rough edges contributes to the clean and polished appearance typical of this style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform pastel color with no gradients, shadows, or blending artifacts near the figure's edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is a uniform pastel yellow. This color is consistent throughout the image without gradients, shadows, or blending artifacts, creating a clean, unobtrusive backdrop for the chibi figure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the facial expression more animated than the original (e.g., wider eyes, open mouth) but still anatomically consistent and not distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a stylized cartoon character, typically featuring exaggerated expressions. However, due to the facial blur, no facial expression is visible, making it impossible to assess animation or anatomical consistency.",
