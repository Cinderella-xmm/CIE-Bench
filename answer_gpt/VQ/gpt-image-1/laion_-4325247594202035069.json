    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of all four figures covered in soft-looking fabric with consistent, non-repeating bold patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow, and do they lack visible seams, pixelation, or artificial textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows figures with surfaces that appear to be made of soft fabric. They have consistent bold patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow, which are visually striking. There is no evidence of visible seams, pixelation, or artificial textures upon inspection. The figures display smooth transitions and a tactile quality typical of fabric surfaces with plush textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the legs and arms of all four figures morph into exaggerated fins and tails in a way that maintains their original dynamic poses without broken geometry or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the legs and arms of the figures have been transformed into exaggerated fins and tails. Despite these changes, the figures maintain their original dynamic poses, indicating a careful edit that preserves the continuity of the physical form without broken geometry or unnatural bends. The morphing follows a coherent design logic typical in creative reimagining of figures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the weapons of each figure been reimagined as integrated fish-like features (such as fins or tail extensions) without floating or misaligned components that break physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features weapons that have been reimagined as integrated fish-like features, blending seamlessly with the figures' anatomy. The components appear physically integral to each figure, with no floating parts or misalignment that break the logical cohesion of the design. This shows a consistent creative approach to fuse weapon elements with the figures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a textured sandy fabric surface with subtle shading and depth, and are all four figures positioned naturally on it without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the edited image is a textured sandy fabric surface, which gives the impression of subtle shading and depth. The figures are positioned naturally on this surface, and there are no issues such as floating or clipping. The positioning and integration with the background demonstrate careful editing to ensure visual harmony and realism.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands of each figure retain a natural number of fingers (no more than five), maintain ergonomic grip positions, and show no signs of deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the hands in the edited figures, each hand retains a natural number of fingers, not exceeding five. They are positioned in ergonomic grip positions appropriate for the wielded weapons, and there are no signs of deformation or extra digits. The design coherence is preserved, showing attention to anatomical details in the edit.",
