    "Question": "Q1: Does the top hat sit naturally on the capybara's head without distorting the head shape or causing visible seams or texture mismatches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top hat appears to rest naturally on the capybara's head. The hat fits well and follows the contour of the head without creating any visible distortion, interruption in the texture, or inconsistencies in the fur around the contact area. These observations lead to the conclusion that the top hat is well-integrated with the image, utilizing our knowledge of how clothing and accessories should realistically interact with an animal's form.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the teacup held by the capybara’s front paws at a natural angle and scale, with no deformation or floating appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara holds the teacup with a realistic grip using its front paws. The angle at which the paw meets the teacup appears consistent with a natural holding position, and the teacup is proportionately sized for the capybara, showing no signs of deformation or an unrealistic floating appearance. This indicates a coherent integration of the teacup into the scene, supported by our understanding of how objects should appear when held by similar creatures.",
