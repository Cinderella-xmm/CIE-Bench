      "question": "Does the central green block retain its original geometric shape after being converted into a 3D chibi-style cartoon character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central green block has been transformed into a cartoon character with facial features and limbs, while still retaining its core rectangular block shape. The addition of these features fits within the chibi style, which often includes anthropomorphized shapes but alters the original geometry to be more stylized and expressive. Therefore, while the block retains some structural resemblance to its original form, the transformation alters its original pure geometric shape significantly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red blocks redesigned as lively supporting characters free from unnatural textures and maintain their original structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red blocks are given expressions and appendages, turning them into characters. These modifications shift from the blocks' original geometric form in Image A to anthropomorphic figures. The textures appear smooth and cartoonish, avoiding unnatural appearances, and the design aligns with a cohesive chibi style. However, their original structural integrity as simple geometric blocks is not maintained due to these cartoonish adaptations.",

      "question": "Does the transformed background with soft pastel colors blend naturally with the foreground elements without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features soft pastel colors and heart motifs, which align well with the chibi aesthetic of the foreground characters. There are no apparent visual artifacts, and the backdrop offers an aesthetically coherent appearance, ensuring the foreground characters stand out against a thematically consistent backdrop.",

      "question": "Are the heart-shaped confetti elements evenly distributed and visually plausible without causing any loss of detail in the surrounding blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The heart-shaped confetti in Image B is distributed evenly and proportionally across the background and around the characters. It complements the chibi theme without overpowering the characters or obscuring details. The design doesn't reflect the original block form, but it fulfills its role decoratively, ensuring all foreground elements remain visually clear.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the red blocks and the central green block maintain a consistent chibi aesthetic without any noticeable inconsistencies in style or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the red and green blocks have been styled with a chibi aesthetic featuring exaggerated facial expressions, bright colors, and smooth surfaces. They maintain consistency in style, as all block-turned-characters share the same cartoonish features and textures. There are no visible inconsistencies in how they have been stylized.",
