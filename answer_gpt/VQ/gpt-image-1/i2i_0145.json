      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the white horse maintain its natural texture and lighting, integrating seamlessly into the new forest background without showing any unnatural contrasts or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white horse is depicted with a smooth texture and lighting that appears consistent with its new forest environment. The light source, sunlight streaming through the canopy, casts shadows and highlights on the horse that align with the expected natural setting. The horse's white coat reflects the overall ambient light of the forest, and there are no stark contrasts or shadows that seem out of place or artificially inserted. Through this careful integration of lighting and shadows, the horse maintains a natural appearance in relation to its environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added forest and tree elements visually consistent with the horse's presence, and does the sunlight streaming through the trees create natural highlights and shadows on the horse without unnatural disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The forest setting and elements like trees and foliage are rendered with a high level of detail and realism, matching the horse's detailed features. The sunlight creates dynamic highlights and shadows on both the horse and the surrounding forest, emulating how natural light would filter through tree canopies. These lighting effects are consistent and blend the horse into its environment effectively, without any jarring or unnatural disruptions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the hooves of the horse appear to interact naturally with the forest floor, such as showing realistic mud or leaves, and are there any visible artifacts where the grass meets the new forest ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hooves of the horse in Image B appear to make contact with the forest floor in a realistic manner. Although the grass from Image A is now replaced by a more textured forest ground, there is no evidence of mismatched overlays or visible artifacts at this contact point. The forest floor includes elements like leaves and possibly dirt beneath the horse, which are in harmony with the expected interaction of a horse's hooves in a forest environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting on the horse's body correctly simulate sunlight filtering through the trees and casting shadows from surrounding forest elements, without any unnatural bright spots or dark patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the lighting on the horse appears to accurately mimic sunlight filtering through a forest canopy. This is evidenced by the natural interplay of shadows and highlights across the horse's body, suggesting light is interacting with both the horse and surrounding objects (e.g., trees, foliage) naturally. There are no artificial spots or unexpected dark patches, indicating a well-executed integration of environmental lighting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the horseâ€™s leap look structurally coherent with the new forest setting, with appropriate motion blur and a trajectory that suggests a natural leap from within the shadows without any geometric distortions or visual incongruities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse's leap in Image B appears structurally coherent with the dense forest setting. The trajectory and pose of the horse, which is mid-leap, align with its environment, suggesting a natural movement. There are subtle indications of motion, like the mane and tail positioning, contributing to the sense of motion. The lighting also accurately depicts its dynamic movement through shadows, and there are no geometric distortions or visual inconsistencies noted, presenting an overall cohesive representation.",
