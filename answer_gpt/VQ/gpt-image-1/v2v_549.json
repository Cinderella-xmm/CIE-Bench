      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style Funko Pop figure maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the baseball player's pose and attire without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure adheres to the classic characteristics of such figurines, which include exaggerated head size and simplified body proportions. While this is not realistic, it is intentional and consistent with the stylized design typical of Funko Pop products. Therefore, although the proportions differ from those of a real person, they align with the expected design of a chibi-style figure, maintaining intended consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the detailed textures and lighting of the realistic depiction of the figure outside the box natural and consistent with the lighting and textures in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a Funko Pop figure which, by design, lacks the realism of a human due to its smooth surfaces and stylized form. The texture, being plastic-like, is consistent with other Funko Pop figurines rather than realistic human textures. The lighting appears even across the figure, consistent with typical studio product photography rather than with complex, varied real-world lighting like Image A, but it suits the context of the product depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there an absence of unnatural textures or loss of fine details where the chibi-style figure transitions to the realistic depiction of the figure outside the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop figure in Image B does not transition from chibi style to realistic depiction as it fully embraces the stylized genre. There is no blend into a realistic style as the figure remains constantly faithful to its playful and smooth design language typical to Funko Pops, ensuring there is no loss of consistency or accuracy.",

      "question": "Do the Funko Pop-style box and its elements (ball, glove, title) integrate naturally with the overall scene without disrupting the visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box and its elements follow a consistent design synonymous with commercial products—highly stylized with clear outlines, vibrant colors, and thematic consistency with Funko Pop merchandise. The title 'Baseball Legend' and the illustrations match the aesthetic language of this genre, ensuring they visually integrate seamlessly with the concept of a collector's product. While it diverges from realism, it effectively retains credibility within its own context.",

      "question": "Does the isometric view of the Funko Pop-style box preserve the structural integrity and avoid any broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The isometric view of the box in Image B maintains proper structural details—sharp edges, clear lines, and well-defined geometry consistent with product design aesthetics. The box appears solid and proportional, without any distortion or construction errors that could disrupt visual integrity or hinder understanding of the product's form.",
