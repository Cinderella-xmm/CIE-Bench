    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the luminous panels follow the exact shape and curvature of the original headâ€™s surface without visible gaps or overlapping seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminous panels appear to adhere closely to the contours of the structure suggesting a seamless application where the edges align precisely without overlapping or gaps. The panels are integrated in a way that conforms to the shape and curvature of the structure, creating a cohesive appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the neon animations on the digital panels displayed with sharp, continuous light patterns and no pixelated or fragmented sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital panels in Image B showcase sharp and continuous neon light patterns. The illumination appears smooth and consistent, with no visible signs of pixelation or fragmentation that would disrupt the glow or design of the neon effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the synthetic foliage emit a soft, even glow from within, and do the individual plant forms have defined structure and depth without appearing like flat decals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The synthetic foliage in Image B is depicted with a distinct glow that emerges softly and evenly, indicating the intent of internal illumination. The individual plants have well-defined structures and apparent depth, moving away from a flat appearance which suggests layering and dimensionality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the metallic surfaces of the surrounding buildings show accurate reflections and subtle surface variations without distorted grid patterns or stretched textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic surfaces of the buildings display reflections and subtle surface variations consistent with high-quality digital rendering. There is an absence of distorted grid patterns or stretched textures, which indicates careful texture mapping and rendering techniques, ensuring realistic appearances.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transformed head and pedestal aligned correctly with the horizon and surrounding buildings, showing no angular distortion or perspective mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The alignment of the head and pedestal in Image B appears to correspond properly with the horizon and the nearby buildings, manifesting a cohesion in perspective. There is no observed angular distortion or mismatch in perspective that would indicate misalignment.",
