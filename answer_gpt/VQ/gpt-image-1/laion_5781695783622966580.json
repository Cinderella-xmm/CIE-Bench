      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the hat symmetrical and aligned with the brim and crown, without jagged edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To analyze Image B, observe the geometric patterns on the hat's brim and crown. The patterns appear consistent and symmetrical, showing precision in their alignment along the brim and crown. The lines are smooth, indicating no jagged edges or disruptions. World knowledge suggests that well-crafted designs in fashion maintain symmetry and clean lines to exhibit elegance and craftsmanship. Therefore, Image B displays symmetry and alignment in its patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the brim follow the contour of the hat and reflect light naturally, without appearing as flat or detached patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold accents can be seen following the contour of the hat. They are blended into the design, exhibiting a shimmer that indicates natural light reflection. This suggests that the accents are part of the hat's fabric and show dimensionality, not flatness. Gold accents typically are used in fashion to highlight contours and add elegance by reflecting light effectively. Image B maintains this characteristic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the turquoise, cream, and silver motifs smoothly blended into the fabric, without abrupt color shifts or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, the motifs show a smooth blending with gradual color transitions between the turquoise, cream, and silver shades. There are no visible pixelation or harsh boundaries, indicating that the colors integrate well into the fabric. In fashion design, smooth blending emphasizes the continuity and quality of the design. Thus, Image B projects seamless blending of colors.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the patterns on the hat avoid intersecting or distorting the natural wave and volume of the hair, maintaining clear separation between the two?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows the geometric patterns on the hat maintain a distinct separation from the hair, preserving the natural wave and volume of the hair. The hat does not appear to overlap or distort the hair's structure or appearance. Visual separation is a typical characteristic in well-composed images where different elements (hair, hat) should not interfere visually. Image B successfully upholds this division.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the shape of the hatâ€™s brim and crown preserved with consistent thickness and curvature, without visible warping or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals a hat with a consistent brim and crown shape. The thickness and curvature maintain uniformity without signs of warping or deformation. Traditionally, fashion accessories are crafted to keep structural integrity, so any deformation would be conspicuous. Image B illustrates preservation of the hat's shape, ensuring a polished appearance.",
