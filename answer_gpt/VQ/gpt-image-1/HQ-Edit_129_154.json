    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the crown-like head formed from the lid free of distorted edges or broken geometry, and does it maintain a consistent metallic surface with the original teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a metallic owl with a crown-like head that resembles the lid of a teapot. The head has intricate patterns similar to the teapot lid in Image A. The geometry appears consistent, with no visible distortions or breaks, and the surface maintains a uniform metallic appearance as it does in the teapot before the transformation. This suggests that the design transition was handled smoothly, preserving the integrity of the surface quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the spout-to-beak transformation maintain a smooth, continuous metallic surface without cracks, unnatural bends, or texture discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beak of the owl in Image B seems to have been artistically transformed from what would be the spout of a teapot in Image A. Observing the transition closely, the beak displays a seamless appearance with no visible cracks or breaks. The texture of the metal flows naturally from the face to the beak, indicating a skillful transformation without misalignments or disruption in the surface continuity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tail formed from the handle smoothly curved and proportionally aligned with the body, without abrupt angles or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail seems to originate from what could be envisioned as the handle in the teapot setup from Image A. When examined, the tail extends in a graceful curve consistent with the body’s flow. There are no awkward angles or gaps that would indicate disjointedness, and the material looks evenly distributed, maintaining a harmonious metallic consistency.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical eyes positioned symmetrically on the head, with visible cogs and soft glow that do not cause halos, color bleeding, or texture mismatch with surrounding metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical eyes in Image B are prominent features that exhibit symmetry on the owl’s head, showing well-rendered cogs. The glow from the eyes is soft and contained, avoiding any excessive halo effect or color bleeding that would distract from the cohesive metallic look. The surrounding metal matches well with the eye details, reinforcing the industrial aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden branch beneath the owl well-integrated into the scene, with consistent wood texture, shadowing, and depth relative to the original table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl stands upon a wooden branch. This branch displays a wood texture that seems detailed and consistent with its surroundings, blending naturally with the tabletop it rests on. The branch’s integration is enhanced by consistent shadowing and depth cues relative to the surface of the table, ensuring the scene looks unified.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the engraved patterns across the body now resemble metallic feathers with consistent layering and directionality, without pixelation or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's body engravings resemble a metallic feather pattern, transitioning from the abstract designs of Image A’s teapot surface. These patterns exhibit consistent directionality and layering akin to feathers. The detail appears sharp and intact, indicating no significant pixelation or detail loss during the transformation, thus replicating the appearance of metallic feathers authentically.",
