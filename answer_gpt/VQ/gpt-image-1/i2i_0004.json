      "question": "Does the enlarged head appear natural and maintain structural coherence without distortion or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head appears proportional and maintains structural coherence. Enlarged heads are common in designs, such as bobbleheads or caricatures, and often emphasize prominent features while still appearing natural. The absence of distortion or unnatural stretching is a sign of quality in such design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cartoonified body free of obvious artifacts and maintains a certain sense of realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body in Image B maintains proportions and smooth lines typical of a cartoonified style. It's free of pixelation, misalignment, or unnatural artifacts, which contributes to a polished appearance, despite its unrealistic proportions compared to a human body.",

      "question": "Does the positioning of the bobblehead on the bookshelf look visually plausible and structurally consistent with the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bobblehead appears well-positioned on the shelf, integrated with the perspective and lighting of the surroundings. Its placement aligns with the linear arrangement of the books, maintaining the realism of the sceneâ€™s spatial and structural consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the face retained its accuracy with no loss of fine details or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the face is blurred and not visible, the rest of the image is free from any detail loss or unnatural textures that would affect the face region. Typically, an accurate and natural appearance involves well-detailed textures and shading, even if blurred.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the combination of an accurate face and a cartoonified body achieve coherence and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes a typical bobblehead style, combining a proportional enlarged head with a stylized body. The coherence of the design is achieved through consistent cartoon-style which is widely accepted in merchandise as both humorous and cohesive, preserving a natural overall look.",
