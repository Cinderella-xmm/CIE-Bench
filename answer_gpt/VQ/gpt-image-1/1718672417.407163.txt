    "Question": "Q4: Are the metallic components and amulets in the braids anchored realistically, with no floating elements or unnatural angles that suggest poor integration?",
    "explanation": "The metallic elements in Image B are observed for their interaction with the braids to assess realism. The beads and pendants are placed at logical angles and positions which suggest natural integration without floating or appearing detached from the strands.",
    "answer": "Yes"
