      "question": "Are the moko tattoos on the warrior’s face, chest, arms, and back continuous and free from broken lines or pixelated textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tattoos on the warrior's body are stylized, with a clear outline and consistent coloration, suggesting a design similar to a graphic or illustrated style rather than realistic tattoos. Given the cartoonish appearance of Image B, the tattoos appear smooth and uninterrupted, in line with the style of a game card.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the flax fibers of the piupiu skirt and leg wraps maintain natural variation in length, thickness, and shading without appearing overly smooth or synthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which has a stylized, illustrated aesthetic, the piupiu skirt and leg wraps appear consistent with the graphical style, lacking natural variation typical of realistic textures but looking intentional rather than synthetic within this context.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the warrior’s limbs positioned naturally with correct joint alignment and muscle tension, avoiding exaggerated or impossible bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior adopts a cartoonish stance exaggerated to fit the game card’s art style. While the character might exhibit slightly exaggerated features due to its illustrative nature, there are no apparent impossibilities or awkward bends considering this artistic choice.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carved-wood title banner in Image B has a cohesive integration with its background. While it embraces an illustrated aesthetic, the shadowing and edging give it a suitably grounded appearance with no floating or unnatural clipping visible.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stat bars are clearly laid out and do not interfere with the warrior’s figure or background. They are legibly positioned and maintain even spacing, fitting the card's playful design and remaining unobtrusive.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame edges are part of the stylized card and consequently do not exhibit realistic reflections typical of metal but are consistent in thickness and curvature within the card’s artistic style.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nameplate in Image B is centrally placed and blends with the character card theme. Though it lacks natural texture, it adheres to the overall illustrative style, maintaining consistency without dissonance against the card’s design.",
