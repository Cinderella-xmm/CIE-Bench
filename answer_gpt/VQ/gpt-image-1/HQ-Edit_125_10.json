      "question": "Does the sail's surface retain its original fabric texture and intricate knotwork design when converted into a game board layout, without visible pixelation, warping, or inconsistent patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sail is illustrated with an intricate knotwork design similar to that in Image A. The surface appears consistent with the fabric texture without pixelation or warping, maintaining the clarity required for a game board. This can be deduced from the visual cues that show a smooth and neat design transition from realistic 3D texture to stylized 2D design, which indicates careful handling of patterns and layout.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mini figures derived from the rowers positioned correctly along the hull, maintaining proportional size and anatomical structure without distortion or missing limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are simplified to a stylized form on a game board. Despite the abstraction, they maintain clear proportional size and anatomical structure typical of game pieces. Each is distinct without missing limbs, aligning well along the hull similar to Image A but adapting to the game style. This reasoning stems from the visual cues where figures are arranged consistently in a grid within Image B, similar to their placement along the boat.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the Norse motifs extended onto the box cover match the original carving style and material appearance of the shipâ€™s dragon head and hull, without jagged edges or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Norse motifs in Image B are stylized versions of the carvings seen on the ship's dragon head and hull in Image A. They are transferred to a graphic design format that portrays the shape and shading consistently without jagged edges, maintaining smooth lines typical of Norse aesthetics. This is deduced from the observation of the dragon head and adjacent patterns, which remain visually cohesive and appropriately designed for a board game thematic representation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the typography for \"Voyage of the Vikings\" clearly legible and stylistically consistent with the historical theme, without floating above the surface or casting unrealistic shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typography is crafted to reflect a style consistent with the historical theme, featuring legibility enhanced by bold font choice and placement. The lettering does not appear to float unnaturally or exhibit unrealistic shadows, which would detract from the thematic narrative. This conclusion is based on observing the visual details and context of the font's integration within the overall box design, ensuring coherence in historical representation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wooden texture accents on the box sides match the grain pattern and lighting of the original wooden base and tabletop, without visible tiling or color inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden texture accents on the sides of the box in Image B mimic the grain pattern and lighting found in the wooden base and tabletop of Image A, delivering a visual harmony in material representation. The textures are smoothly applied without visible tiling or color inconsistencies, preserving the intended aesthetic. This is verified by the similarity in the portrayal of wood grain, texture, and shading between the illustrations in both images.",
