      "question": "Do the LEGO blocks forming the bookshelf and books have a uniform, smooth plastic texture throughout, with no residual wood grain or mixed material appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the LEGO blocks are designed to have a characteristic smooth plastic texture, which is evident from the uniform surface appearance typical of LEGO materials. There are no visible signs of residual wood grain or mixed materials, as LEGO blocks are crafted from plastic and tend to have consistent texture and appearance. Thus, based on this analysis, the surface texture is uniform and smooth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the LEGO blocks uniformly earthy-toned (e.g., browns, tans, dark reds) and consistent with the original bookshelf’s color scheme, without any unexpected or jarring color deviations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the LEGO blocks showcase a range of earthy tones such as browns, tans, and dark reds, which collectively provide a harmonious color scheme. These colors resemble the palette used in the original bookshelf from Image A. There are no apparent anomalies or deviations that clash with the overall earthy appearance. This cohesive color scheme aligns with the original design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the darker LEGO bricks used for carvings clearly aligned and shaped to replicate the original decorative patterns on the spines and shelf edges without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the darker LEGO bricks are arranged to mimic the intricate patterns similar to the decorative elements found in Image A. The alignment of these bricks appears visually precise, with clear shapes demarcating the intended patterns on the shelf edges and book spines, maintaining consistency with the original design’s elements. There is no evident blurring or misalignment, allowing the decorative features to be distinctly recognized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the top of the LEGO tower taper smoothly and symmetrically from the base upward, without jagged edges, irregular steps, or disproportionate narrowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the structure of Image B, the top of the LEGO tower appears to taper smoothly and symmetrically as it ascends from the base, resulting in a neat triangular or pyramid-like shape. The lines are clean and regular, showcasing a precise taper with no jagged edges or disproportionate steps. This symmetry contributes to the overall coherent structure of the bookshelf.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background behind the LEGO tower completely plain and muted, with no traces of the original textured wallpaper or lighting artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is plain and has a muted color tone, serving as a seamless backdrop to the LEGO tower. This contrasts with Image A, which features a textured wallpaper. The background in Image B is free from any such textures or patterns, contributing to a simple and unobtrusive appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all LEGO blocks aligned perfectly in rows and columns, with no gaps, overlaps, or floating pieces that disrupt the modular structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B, the LEGO blocks are organized in precise, well-aligned rows and columns. Each block fits neatly into its place, showcasing the modular nature inherent to LEGO construction. There are no visible gaps or overlaps, and all pieces appear firmly placed, maintaining a cohesive modular structure without disruption.",
