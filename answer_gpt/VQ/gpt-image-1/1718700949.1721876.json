      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the elephant have clear, smooth edges without visible artifacts, distortions, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case is viewed as a transparent enclosure, and it is important to notice the clarity and smoothness of its edges. The visual assessment shows that the edges of the glass are sharp and uniformly clear, with no visible distortions or reflections that look unnatural. World knowledge informs us that well-crafted glass should have such qualities, reinforcing the observation.",

      "question": "Are the metallic resin details on the elephantâ€™s armor consistently textured and reflective, showing no unnatural glossiness or broken patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in Image B is adorned with armor that has metallic resin details. A close inspection reveals that these details have a consistent texture and the right degree of reflectiveness typical of high-quality metallic resin, which should neither be overly glossy nor have broken patterns. This aligns with the expected appearance of such materials, ensuring a natural and appealing finish.",

      "question": "Are the silk-gold banners located at the four corners of the glass case, properly anchored, and displaying natural fabric draping and color variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the banners are positioned at opposite corners and are assessed for their draping and anchoring qualities. The visual cues show that they hang naturally with realistic folds and variations in color consistent with silk-gold fabric. Their placement suggests secure anchoring, with no signs of floating or inconsistencies that would indicate otherwise.",

      "question": "Do the layered mountain silhouettes in the background show gradual opacity and depth, with no sharp edges or inconsistent transparency levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background mountains in Image B are analyzed for their opacity and layering. These silhouettes exhibit a gradual change in opacity and tonal depth that create a realistic perspective, which is typical for such scenes. World knowledge about landscape visuals supports the understanding that natural layering should have smooth transitions and no irregular sharpness.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bonsai-like trees at the foreground edges realistically integrated into the rocky surface, with natural leaf textures and root placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the bonsai-like trees in the foreground of Image B, they appear naturally rooted into the rocky surface. The leaves show realistic texturing, and the roots seem to be positioned correctly, consistent with the natural integration of bonsai trees into such environments. This consistency reflects common aesthetic and botanical principles.",
