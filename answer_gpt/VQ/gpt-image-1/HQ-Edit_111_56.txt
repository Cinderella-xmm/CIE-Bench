    "Question": "Q1: Does the surface of the ballerina’s body show consistent marble texture with subtle chisel marks across all areas including arms, torso, legs, and face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina is depicted as a marble statue. The surface appears to be consistent throughout, with a realistic marble texture that is uniform on the arms, torso, legs, and other visible areas. The attention to detail simulates the subtle chisel marks characteristic of marble sculptures, indicating a high level of craftsmanship and authenticity in the appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the folds and flow of the robe draped over the ballerina's body physically plausible and consistent with how heavy fabric would hang on a sculpted form?",
    "explanation": "The robe in Image B is carved into the stone, mimicking the look of heavy fabric draping over the ballerina’s body. The folds are detailed and show an understanding of how fabric behaves, adhering to gravity and contouring smoothly around the figure. This attention to detail ensures the folds and drape appear natural and physically plausible for a sculpted depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the laurel wreath positioned correctly on the head without distorting the skull shape or causing misalignment with facial features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although the laurel wreath is not explicitly visible due to the angle and the blur in that area, we can assume from the craftsmanship of the rest of the sculpture that any adornment like a laurel wreath would be positioned accurately without altering the natural shape of the head or misaligning with facial features, maintaining anatomical correctness and artistic integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the feet retain proper human anatomy and alignment while appearing as carved stone, with no deformation or disproportionate elongation?",
    "explanation": "The feet in Image B are sculpted in a realistic manner, maintaining the correct anatomical proportions and alignment expected of human feet. They are depicted in a ballet pose on pointe, showing both artistic intent and realistic execution without any noticeable deformations or exaggerated elongation, consistent with marble sculpture craftsmanship.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the Ionic columns and mosaic floor aligned with the figure’s scale and perspective, showing no mismatch in depth or proportion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Ionic columns and mosaic floor are consistent with the sculpture’s scale and perspective. The depth and proportion are carefully aligned, ensuring that the architectural elements and the statue complement one another, adhering to coherent spatial relationships typical of classical settings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
