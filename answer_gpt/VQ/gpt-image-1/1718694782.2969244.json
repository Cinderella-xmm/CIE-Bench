      "question": "Are the motion lines surrounding the character in Panel 1 smoothly aligned with the direction of motion and free from jagged edges or inconsistent spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, motion lines are used to emphasize the character's direction of movement. These lines are designed to complement the energetic pose of the character, who is depicted mid-leap off a cliff. The lines appear smooth and consistently spaced, reinforcing the motion without any jagged edges or inconsistencies. This artistic choice effectively communicates the dynamic action of jumping.",

      "question": "Is the internal monologue bubble positioned close to the character’s head without overlapping facial features or distorting the character’s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the internal monologue bubble is positioned near the character's head and does not intersect with his facial features or disrupt his outline. The positioning ensures the text is easy to read and adds excitement to the jump without conflicting with the visual depiction of the character.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sky background in Panel 1 display a smooth gradient from warm to cool tones without visible color bands or unnatural transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Panel 1 of Image B transitions smoothly from warm hues around the sun setting horizon to cooler tones further away. This gradient effect is accomplished without the presence of color bands or abrupt changes, implying a natural transition characteristic of sunsets. This suggests an accurate depiction of color transitions in the sky.",

      "question": "Is the parachute in Panel 2 correctly shaped, proportionally sized relative to the character, and connected by visible cords that extend logically from the character’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the parachute is designed with a semi-rounded shape typical of parachutes. Its proportional size relative to the character suggests that it can realistically support him. Visible cords extend from the parachute to the character’s back, highlighting the logical and practical design in alignment with real-world parachute configurations.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the animated clouds in both panels appear as distinct volumetric forms with soft edges and no clipping into the character or mountain silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds in both panels are shown as distinct, cartoonish shapes with smooth edges and soft contours, differentiating them from the rest of the scene. They maintain their integrity by not overlapping the character or mountain silhouettes, effectively staying clear of any clipping issues.",
