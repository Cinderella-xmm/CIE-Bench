    "Question": "Q1: Does the illustrated bird retain the original bird's body proportions and head-to-body ratio without exaggerated or distorted features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrated bird does not match the realistic features of the bird in Image A. The illustration simplifies the bird's design, resulting in a more stylized appearance. The head is proportionally larger compared to the body, and the features are deliberately exaggerated for a cartoonish look. This differs significantly from Image A, where the bird has realistic proportions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the cherry blossom motifs surrounding the bird evenly spaced and proportionally consistent with the original flowers in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms surrounding the illustrated bird are drawn in a more simplified and stylized manner, with consistent spacing that deviates from the more natural and randomly spaced blossoms in Image A. The consistency in spacing and uniformity is typical in illustration styles versus the organic pattern seen in a realistic setting.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the typographic logo positioned at the top of the image with smooth edges and uniform spacing, free from pixelation or blurring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the typographic logo is positioned clearly at the top and appears to have smooth edges and uniform spacing without any visible pixelation or blurring. This is characteristic of a high-quality graphic or vector design, which maintains clarity across various media.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the pastel gradient background transition smoothly from one hue to another without visible banding or sharp edges?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B exhibits a smooth gradient transition from one hue to another, which is a common characteristic of digital designs aimed at maintaining a soft, aesthetically pleasing backdrop. No banding or harsh edges are visible, showing a quality rendering typical of modern graphic design techniques.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the yellow color of the illustrated bird uniformly applied across its body without patches of over-saturation or loss of fine texture detail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow color on the illustrated bird is applied consistently without apparent patches of over-saturation or texture loss, maintaining a uniform appearance. This is typical in digital illustrations where flat colors are used for a clean and striking visual impact, unlike the more varied and textured appearance of a real bird as seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
