      "question": "Are the crystal facets on the sandcastle uniformly shaped and aligned with the original tower geometry, without any jagged or incomplete edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle is depicted as a geometric structure made of crystal facets. Each facet is clear and sharp, maintaining the symmetry and design of the original sandcastle architecture. Common knowledge about crystal structures suggests that they often feature uniform, precise facets that align smoothly with the overall form they are meant to imitate. Observing the sandcastle, it shows no signs of jagged or incomplete edges; instead, it appears to be a well-crafted piece. Therefore, the facets are uniformly shaped and aligned.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gemstones replace the seashells accurately in position and size, and do they exhibit smooth, reflective surfaces without floating above the sand or water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seashells from Image A are replaced by gemstones, which are positioned in a similar manner to the original seashell placement, reflecting thoughtful positioning. The gemstones exhibit smooth, lustrous surfaces that suggest realism in terms of gemstone appearance. They rest directly on the frosted glass surface, adhering to gravity's laws, thus not appearing to float unnaturally above the surface. Therefore, the gemstones accurately replace the seashells in both position and size, while maintaining realistic reflective properties.",

      "question": "Is the wave pattern on the frosted glass surface continuous and flowing, with no abrupt breaks or unnatural line interruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the frosted glass surface with etched wave patterns akin to what might be seen in a serene ocean scene. These patterns are visibly continuous and fluid, replicating a natural wave motion without abrupt stops or jarring line disruptions. The visual continuity is indicative of a well-designed glass etching and aligns with world knowledge regarding how wave patterns should flow naturally. Therefore, the wave pattern is continuous and flowing.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the display case visible and straight, with no clipping or warping of the internal elements, and do they align with the perspective of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case is clearly defined with visible edges that maintain straightness and align perfectly with the perspective of the scene. No warping or clip of internal elements, such as the sandcastle or other objects within the case, is evident. Noting the uniformity and clarity in the image, it reveals a consistent and coherent representation that accurately reflects a real-world display case. Therefore, the edges are visible and straight, conforming to the scene’s perspective.",

      "question": "Is the red shovel with yellow handle fully visible and undistorted, lying flat on the surface without intersecting or appearing behind glass where it shouldn’t be?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shovel is depicted as a transparent version in blue, harmonious with the crystal theme. It is fully visible and lies flat on the frosted glass surface, clearly positioned without any distortion or intersection with other elements. Given the norms of object placement in a display case, the shovel’s positioning appears rational and logical, seamlessly integrating with the surrounding objects. Therefore, the shovel is visible and correctly placed.",
