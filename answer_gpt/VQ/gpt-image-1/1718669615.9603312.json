    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the spaceship retain a coherent circular shape with consistent proportions, and are the added circular motifs and meander patterns aligned symmetrically without warping or overlapping irregularly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no spaceship; instead, there is an object resembling an ancient vase with circular motifs and meander patterns. The design maintains a symmetrical and coherent shape, with the motifs evenly distributed and without any irregularity in alignment. Based on the analysis of the object, it adheres to the principles of artistic design, which ensures that shapes and patterns maintain a consistent and balanced appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the painted patterns on the spaceshipâ€™s surface free from digital artifacts, such as jagged edges, unnatural brushstroke textures, or inconsistent color gradients that suggest poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B is a digital rendering of an ancient-style vase, with painted patterns. The patterns are smooth and show no signs of jagged edges or unnatural brushstroke textures. The colors and patterns are consistent, indicating a high-quality digital rendering without artifacts typically associated with poor digital design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the abstract wave forms in the landscape below continuous and smoothly curved, avoiding sharp breaks or abrupt transitions that disrupt the flow of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background contains abstract wave forms that are smoothly curved and continuous. These forms mimic the flowing patterns often seen in traditional art, without any sharp breaks or abrupt transitions, thus maintaining a harmonious and flowing design in the landscape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the colors in the transformed landscape consist exclusively of muted earth tones (e.g., browns, tans, dark reds) without any bright or out-of-place colors like neon greens or electric blues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image background in Image B features muted earth tones, predominantly browns and tans. The design refrains from incorporating any bright or surprising colors such as neon greens or electric blues, thereby adhering to a traditional earthy color palette.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the edited spaceship positioned at a consistent altitude above the abstract landscape, with proper perspective alignment relative to the curved railway tracks below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembling an ancient vase is featured, but it is not positioned like a spaceship above railway tracks. Instead, it appears centered within the frame, emphasized against the wavy pattern background. Thus, the concept of altitude and perspective relative to railway tracks does not apply in this image transformation.",
