    "Question": "Q1: Are the geometric shapes of the keys preserved without distortion after being converted into 3D cartoon-style chibi renditions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the keys are rendered with a consistent 3D cartoon-style, converting naturalistic shapes into more stylized versions. The geometric integrity of the shapes, such as the pentagram, triangle, and other elements, appears maintained without observable distortion. When compared to Image A, the design of the keys remains the same despite the styling change, indicating a preservation of their geometric forms. This reflects a conscious effort to retain the original design elements while applying the cartoon style.",

    "Question": "Q4: Does the '囍' paper-cut design in the background complement the keys without disrupting the visual credibility or introducing distracting elements?",
    "explanation": "The background of Image B features the '囍' symbol, common in Chinese culture, especially in weddings for double happiness.

    "Question": "Q5: Are the proportions and sizes of the keys in the 3D cartoon-style chibi rendition realistic and coherent, avoiding any distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the keys are rendered in a cartoon-style, which inherently involves exaggeration and simplification, yet they maintain proportionate relationships between their components. This stylistic choice should align with the aesthetic norms of cartoon renditions which often prioritize expressiveness. The transition from the realistic proportions in Image A to the stylized versions in Image B retains coherence across the design, avoiding disproportionate distortions.",
