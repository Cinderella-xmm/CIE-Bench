      "question": "Does the sofa maintain its structural integrity and proportions from both the front and side views, avoiding any unusual geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa appears consistent in terms of structure and proportions when viewed from the side. The chaise extension maintains a realistic perspective, and the overall dimensions of the sofa, including the height and width, are coherent with what would be expected from a real-life piece of furniture. By comparing to Image A, the sofa in both images maintains similar structural integrity and proportions, indicating no geometric distortions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fabric textures and details of the sofa consistent and clear in both the front and side views, without any visible loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the sofa's fabric is clear and consistent with realistic expectations for a fabric sofa, showing no apparent loss of detail or unnatural textures from the different perspective. Comparing it with Image A, both images depict a sofa with detailed fabric textures that appear realistic and cohesive with the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cushions and legs of the sofa align naturally between the front and side views, maintaining visual plausibility and coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cushions and legs of the sofa are aligned naturally, with the cushions appearing to be proportionally placed on the sofa, and the legs are appropriately supporting the structure from the side view. The alignment and proportions are similar to what is seen in Image A, indicating a cohesive and plausible arrangement in both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the light and shadow effects on the sofa and surrounding area remain consistent and natural when transitioning from the front to the side view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The light and shadow effects in Image B are consistent with a realistic setting, where sunlight from a window casts appropriate shadows on the sofa and the floor, maintaining a natural appearance. Compared to Image A, the light source and resultant shadows are coherent, as both images exhibit naturalistic light and shadow interplay on the sofa and the surroundings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the artwork on the wall and the wall itself retain their natural appearance and realism when viewed from both the front and side perspectives?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork and the wall maintain a realistic appearance with appropriate proportions and detail visibility, regardless of the side perspective. The artwork's abstract design remains consistent, and the wall appears smooth and properly aligned. A comparison with Image A shows that both images successfully depict the wall and artwork naturally and realistically.",
