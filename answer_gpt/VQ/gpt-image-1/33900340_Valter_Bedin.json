    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the archways in the tower appear as articulated limbs with natural joint-like transitions, preserving their original arch shape and avoiding unnatural bends or breaks in geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower elements are transformed into a giant golem. The visual cues suggest that the archways of the original tower have been creatively reshaped into the golem's limbs. The editing maintains the structure's original form by seamlessly integrating the arches' smooth curves into limb-like structures without abrupt changes or unrealistic angles. The golem's design leverages the arch shape effectively, sustaining a natural feel without breaking the geometric harmony of the limbs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glowing glyphs evenly distributed across the stone surface, matching the texture of the original masonry and lacking jagged edges, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golem's surface is covered with glowing glyphs. The glyphs appear well-integrated across the stone texture, consistent with the stone masonry style seen in Image A. These glyphs maintain a smooth continuity without jagged edges or pixelation, highlighting a careful and seamless editing process that matches the masonry texture, preserving the richness and continuity of the original stone surface with a mystical aura.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition from dark shadowed areas to the mystical aura around the structure gradual and continuous, without sharp discontinuities or floating light effects that lack grounding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a mystical glow surrounding the golem. This glow extends naturally from the shadows, forming a continuous, gradual transition. The lighting effects are implemented in a coherent manner, avoiding abrupt changes or floating lights. This realistic and grounded presentation showcases the blending of backlighting and shadow, creating an immersive and magical atmosphere.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the luminous guide wisp occupy the same position as the original figure and dog, maintaining proportional scale and spatial alignment, while exhibiting a translucent, wispy texture without solid edges or anatomical features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminous guide wisp is positioned precisely where the original figure and dog stood in Image A. This element retains the proportional and spatial alignment, indicating a strong continuity in the editing process. It is characterized by a translucent and ethereal texture, lacking defined edges or anatomical features, supporting a mystical theme while retaining alignment with the original composition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the foreground, midground, and background elements still perceptually layered with correct depth relationships, so that the golem appears to stand within the space rather than floating above or behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the editing portrays the golem standing within the spatial confines of the castle courtyard. The foreground, midground, and background are consistently layered in a manner that maintains depth relationships akin to those in Image A. The golem's placement reflects accurate spatial alignment, firmly positioning it within the scene, thus preserving the perception of depth and ensuring the golem neither floats nor is misaligned within the physical environment.",
