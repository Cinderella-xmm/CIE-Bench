      "question": "Does the scarecrowâ€™s body exhibit a consistent glossy finish across all areas where straw was replaced, without visible seams, unnatural reflections, or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the packaging in Image B does not provide a detailed close-up of the scarecrow's body texture. It primarily shows an illustration on the box, which typically aims for a stylized representation rather than exact material depiction. World knowledge tells us packaging illustrations often do not reflect material finishes accurately as they're designed for visual appeal. Hence, judging the scarecrow's body for a glossy finish, seams, reflections, or texture mismatches from the illustration alone isn't feasible.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hat structurally intact and proportionally consistent with the original, featuring a clearly defined opening at the top that allows for candle placement without distorting its shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image on the packaging (Image B) shows a scarecrow illustration with a hat similar in style but it does not reveal details, such as an opening for candle placement. Given the typical design of packaging illustrations, they aim for an aesthetic overview rather than highlighting specific structural modifications suited for practical purposes (like candle placement). Therefore, we can logically infer that such details might not be depicted consistently in an illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the LED string lights positioned along the scarecrow or packaging in a way that emits soft, localized light without causing unnatural bright spots, flickering effects, or visible wiring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the image, the packaging illustration shows a general view without clear indications of LED string light positioning or effects. The packaging likely emphasizes the saleable features (e.g., visual mood) over technical specifics. Without visible LED light effects like wiring, glow patterns, or integration on the illustration, as per world knowledge of typical packaging design, one cannot confirm the presence and quality of LED lights as described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the crow figurine resting stably on the top edge of the box, aligned with gravitational logic, and matching the size and proportions of the birds seen in flight in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crow figurine is shown sitting on the top edge of the packaging box with no visible signs of instability. It appears well-positioned and proportionate in size concerning the other bird images. The alignment respects gravitational logic as it sits flat and balanced on the box surface. Even in illustrations, size and logical placement are crucial for authenticity, particularly on product packaging that aims to reflect potential product contents.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the packaging surrounding the scarecrow have clean edges, consistent material shading, and proper shadow alignment with the light source, indicating a solid, three-dimensional box structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B is illustrated with clear, sharp edges and uniformly shaded materials that lend it a realistic three-dimensional appearance. The shadows and overall alignment with a presumed light source are coherent, reflecting professional design standards typical in product packaging. This indicates the quality and intentionality in its depiction as a solid, three-dimensional object.",
