    "Question": "Q1: Does the modified dress retain a coherent silhouette that follows the body's natural contours without unnatural stretching or distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dress follows the natural contours of the body, with its intricate geometric patterns designed to align well with the subject's posture. The patterns and the dress's cut visually suggest a coherent silhouette, adhering well to the body without noticeable distortions or unnatural shapes. This conclusion is based on the smooth transition of patterns and the logical alignment with the body shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the beaded clutch positioned naturally in the hands, with visible beadwork that appears uniform and structurally sound without gaps or floating elements?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a beaded clutch held in the subject’s hand in a natural position. The beadwork appears uniform, with no visible gaps or floating elements. The visual representation of the beads is consistent and structured, maintaining the visual integrity expected of a beaded accessory. The subject's grip on the clutch seems plausible and natural, indicating professional alignment and rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the T-strap shoes maintain correct anatomical alignment with the feet, with no overlapping straps or distorted toe boxes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the T-strap shoes are depicted in alignment with the feet, with appropriate straps maintaining a fixed position. Each shoe’s structure, including the straps and toe boxes, appears well-aligned with the feet, showing no signs of distortion or overlap that could suggest misalignment. This proper representation is deduced by observing the clean lines and how the straps conform to the foot's natural shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the linear Deco patterns evenly distributed and aligned with the subject’s posture, avoiding misalignment or perspective errors?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains linear Deco patterns which are evenly distributed across the dress. These patterns appear to enhance the overall aesthetic without any noticeable misalignment or perspective errors. The patterns align well with the subject’s posture, providing a cohesive visual flow. This is determined by the consistency in pattern design symmetry and their predictable alignment based on the dress's structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the material transitions between the dress, sleeves, and accessories seamless, with no visible seams, jagged edges, or unnatural texture blending?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transitions between the different materials of the dress, sleeves, and the beaded clutch are rendered seamlessly. The regions where the materials meet show a natural blend, lacking any visible seams, jagged edges, or inconsistencies in texture blending. The fur-like texture of the sleeves integrates well with the rest of the dress, contributing to a unified appearance. This is reasoned from the smooth surface continuity and consistent texture rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
