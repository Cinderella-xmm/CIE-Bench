      "question": "Are the pastel colors applied to the octopus uniformly distributed without abrupt color shifts or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus is depicted using a cartoon-style illustration with clear and distinct shapes. The pastel color palette is typical for this style, providing broad areas of consistent color without intricate details that could lead to abrupt shifts or pixelation. The color transitions appear smooth and uniform, which is expected in illustrations that avoid complex shading techniques.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the brush outlines around the octopus follow the natural curves of its body and tentacles without overlapping or breaking at joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines of the octopus are stylized in a cartoon manner that typically includes smooth, flowing lines that trace the body and tentacles. Such illustrations maintain continuity in line work, following natural curves without overlapping or breaking at joints, as can be seen in the well-defined and consistent outlines around the octopus.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waves near the shore smooth and consistent in shape, showing natural foam patterns without jagged or broken textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the waves in an illustrative form, which often means simplified and stylized rendering to emphasize consistency and smooth transitions. The waves are depicted with clear curves and gentle foam patterns typical of a cartoon style, demonstrating smoothness without jagged or broken textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text positioned above the horizon line without intersecting clouds or causing visible distortion in the background sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is strategically placed at the top of the image following a visually appealing composition where it remains above the horizon line. This avoids any interference with the clouds and maintains a clean presentation against the background sky without causing distortions or misalignments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the octopus and surrounding terrain align with the direction of the sunset light source and maintain depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a cartoon representation, does not emphasize realistic shadow rendering. Instead, it adopts a flat design with minimal depth perception for stylistic simplicity. The absence of detailed shadows in this illustrative style indicates a deviation from realistic alignment with the light source in the sunset setting.",
