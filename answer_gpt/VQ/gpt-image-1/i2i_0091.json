      "question": "Does the integration of the castle hall elements into the room visually align with the existing lighting and shadows, avoiding unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle hall scene is depicted with consistent lighting and shadows that align with the large windows casting light onto the architectural features such as the arches and columns. The shadows fall naturally on the ground, indicating the presence of a coherent light source. The continuity of shadows supports the visual integrity of the design, suggesting that the integration of elements avoids creating unnatural artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the materials of the newly added castle hall elements, like stone and metal, depicted naturally and free from obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone materials of the castle hall, including the columns and arches, are rendered with realistic textures and tones that mimic real stone. The subtle variations in color and shading enhance the natural appearance of stone. There is no noticeable distortion or artifacting within the materials that would detract from their authenticity.",

      "question": "Have the books, vases, and plants remained undistorted and preserved their original details post-editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, inspection of the space for elements such as books, vases, and plants shows no indications of distortion or loss of detail. These objects retain their intended shapes and features, suggesting they have preserved their original detail during the editing process.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the introduction of the castle hall maintain the room's spatial rationality, keeping the proportions and placements of objects consistent with expectations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The introduction of the castle hall in Image B adheres to spatial rationality by maintaining consistent proportions and placements of the newly added elements. The archways, columns, and benches align with the expected scaling and placement, contributing to a coherent spatial arrangement, without causing a jarring or disproportionate impression.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting effects in the edited castle hall scene match the light source and style of the original room, ensuring continuity in illumination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting effects in the castle hall are consistent with the style of illumination evident from the large windows casting light into the room. The soft, diffused light and the way it highlights and creates shadow play on the stone surfaces are in harmony with the inherent lighting cues of the scene, ensuring continuity.",
