    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the body of the animal consist of small, uniformly sized glossy ceramic tiles arranged in a consistent pattern that follows the contours of the original form without gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the animal is covered in small, evenly sized glossy ceramic tiles. These tiles are arranged meticulously and follow the shape of the animal seamlessly, without visible gaps or misalignments. The consistent patterning suggests attention to detail and craftsmanship. This alignment and pattern consistency adheres to the presented question's requirements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes composed of precisely shaped tiles forming distinct white sclera and black pupils, maintaining their original size and position relative to the snout and head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes in Image B are clearly depicted with precisely formed tiles that create distinct white scleras and black pupils. These tiles maintain the original size and the proportional relationship to the snout and head as seen in typical depictions of such animal figures. This alignment and precision meet the criteria outlined in the question.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the stripes across the body maintain uniform width and spacing, with clear transitions between vibrant orange and deep black tiles that match the original pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes are composed of black tiles that are evenly spaced over the orange tiles, maintaining a uniform width. The transitions between the orange and black tiles are distinct and sharp, contributing to a coherent and appealing visual pattern that reflects common characteristics for such striped animal designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the surface beneath the animal a textured sandy platform with visible granular detail and subtle moisture variation, providing a tactile contrast to the smooth mosaic tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface beneath the animal in Image B is a flat, block-like structure without the granular detail indicative of sand and lacks visible signs of moisture variation. This surface contrasts with what would be considered a textured, sandy platform, thus not matching the described tactile contrast.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the limbs and joints of the animal smoothly contoured with no jagged edges, distorted shapes, or missing tiles that would suggest structural inconsistency or rendering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal's limbs and joints are smoothly contoured with no visible jagged edges, distorted shapes, or missing tiles. The tiles are placed carefully around the curves and joints, maintaining a consistent and error-free structure that suggests high-quality rendering and construction.",
