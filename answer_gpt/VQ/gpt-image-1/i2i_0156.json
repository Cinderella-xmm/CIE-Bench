      "question": "Do the extended page edges blend naturally into the frame without introducing any unnatural breaks or abrupt transitions at the corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the extended page edges appear smooth and continuous, without any abrupt transitions or breaks, which suggests that they blend naturally into the frame. The edges maintain the curvature and linear form expected of pages, matching the natural contours and alignment seen in similar objects and settings. The blending seems seamless, suggesting an aesthetically consistent extension.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the curved shadow cast by the extended pages follow the lighting direction present in the original image, contributing to a natural perception of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B independently, the shadow cast by the pages follows an expected curvature that aligns with the apparent light source direction, consistent with the way shadows behave in similar lighting situations. The gradual shading adds depth and dimensionality, consistent with an angled light source, resulting in a natural appearance that matches typical environmental lighting setups.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the texture and fine details of the extended pages consistent with the original pages, with no visible loss or distortion of the text and paper grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture and details of the pages appear consistent with what one would expect from a book page, with the text and paper grain showing continuity in appearance. The paper's material texture and the text are uniform throughout, aligning well with traditional book pages, maintaining integrity without noticeable distortions or peculiarities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the curvature of the extended pages consistent with the perspective of the original image, creating a believable unfolding effect without distorting the geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Independently examining Image B, the perspective and curvature of the pages are consistent with how pages typically appear when opened, demonstrating a logical continuity in spatial geometry. Lines follow expected paths, and the curvature naturally integrates with the perspective, suggesting a coherent and believable unfolding effect influenced by the typical constraints of book pages.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the interaction between the base of the book and the wooden table appear natural, with no unrealistic gaps or overlaps introduced by the extension of the pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interaction between the book's base and the wooden table appears natural, with no seeming gaps or overlaps that would indicate a visually unrealistic extension. The book rests flat against the surface, adhering to typical spatial relationships between objects of similar layouts, which suggests a coherent integration.",
