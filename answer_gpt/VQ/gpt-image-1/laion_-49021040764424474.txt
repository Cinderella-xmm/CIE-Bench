    "Question": "Q1: Are the orange, black, and silver sections of the truck's body composed of clearly defined LEGO brick patterns with uniform size and alignment, avoiding blurred or inconsistent textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is constructed entirely of LEGO bricks, recognizable by the characteristic interlocking brick pattern and the uniform texture that LEGO pieces provide. The orange, black, and silver sections are clearly composed of LEGO bricks, as seen by their consistent studs and alignment typical of LEGO assembly, avoiding any appearance of blur or texture inconsistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the wheels consist of circular gray LEGO-style pieces with correct proportions and no deformation, maintaining a solid geometric structure without jagged edges or distorted shapes?",
    "explanation": "The wheels in Image B are made of gray LEGO-style pieces, clearly designed to resemble standard LEGO wheels. They have a solid circular shape, smooth edges, and appropriate proportions, consistent with LEGO's geometric designs, and they do not exhibit any jagged edges or deformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth, flat black LEGO tiles arranged in a regular grid pattern without gaps, overlaps, or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "The truck bed in Image B appears to be covered with flat black LEGO tiles. These pieces are usually crafted to fit neatly together, forming a smooth surface. From visual inspection, the bed displays a regular LEGO grid pattern without visible gaps, overlaps, or misalignments, indicating careful assembly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the LEGO truck positioned securely on a flat white shelf with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does the shelf extend appropriately beneath the full width of the truck?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO truck is situated on a white shelf. Visual clues show that the base of the truck is flat against the shelf, with no apparent floating effects or gaps beneath it. Additionally, the shelf is wide enough to accommodate the entire width of the truck, allowing for a secure placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all major structural components such as the tailgate, side steps, and bumpers correctly reconstructed in LEGO form with accurate proportions and proper alignment to the rest of the truck body?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO model of a truck where major components, including the tailgate, side steps, and bumpers, are constructed using LEGO bricks. These parts are proportionate and align well with the body of the truck, adhering to the expected design norms of LEGO sets which emphasize correct scaling and structure for visual coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
