      "question": "Do the outfits, backpacks, and skiing gear of the chibi-style skiers appear consistent with the original design and maintain their structural integrity without any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style skiers are depicted with outfits that are consistent in color and general style with what would be expected in a winter skiing outfit. The chibi style naturally involves simplified and exaggerated features compared to realistic proportions, such as larger heads and eyes, but the structural integrity of the outfits, backpacks, and skiing gear is maintained well. There are no visual cues suggesting distortions in their design; the outfits appear properly worn on their bodies, and the gear looks proportionately suitable for the chibi figures. Compared to Image A, where the skiers have realistic proportions, the design in Image B retains its integrity within the chibi context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and details of the skiers' outfits, backpacks, and skiing gear preserved well, without any noticeable loss or unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, featuring a chibi art style, naturally reduces fine detail and texture to suit the genre’s simplified aesthetic. Despite the reduction in realistic details compared to Image A, the crucial elements such as the colors and general shapes of the outfits, backpacks, and skiing equipment are clear and well-defined, showing no signs of unnatural artifacts. This stylistic simplification is typical and intentional for the chibi style and does not indicate a loss of quality. The overall visual representation is clean and coherent.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the snowy forest setting and the arrangement of environmental elements like trees and snow remain authentic and undistorted, contributing to the overall natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the forest setting with snow-covered trees and the snowy path remains consistent with typical winter scenery. The trees are arranged naturally, and the snow appears uniformly spread, without any signs of distortion or unrealistic elements. Despite the chibi style of the skiers, the environment is maintained in a realistic manner similar to Image A, contributing to a believable snowy forest setting. The environmental elements do not exhibit any noticeable alterations that would detract from their natural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the chibi-style skiers' bodies relative to their surroundings physically rational and free from any geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style skiers exhibit exaggerated body proportions typical of the chibi art style, such as larger heads and petite bodies. However, this is an intentional artistic choice rather than a distortion. Relative to their surroundings—the snowy path and forest—the skiers' proportions remain consistent with what is typically expected in a chibi context. In contrast, Image A showcases more human-like proportions within the same environment. The chibi characters fit well within the setting in Image B without any noticeable geometric distortions that would make them appear out of place.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the edited image, including the skiers, the snowy path, and the surrounding forest, maintain visual credibility without any inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, despite featuring chibi characters, maintains an overall composition that aligns well with the setting provided in Image A. The layout, including the skiers on a snowy path flanked by snow-laden trees, remains consistent and visually credible. The chibi style naturally involves stylistic choices, but these do not create inconsistencies with the environment. The placement and depiction of all elements in Image B contribute to a coherent scene that aligns with the intended snowy forest atmosphere, displaying no jarring contradictions or visual inconsistencies.",
