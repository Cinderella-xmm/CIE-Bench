      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D character maintain structural consistency and visual credibility, avoiding unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style character maintains a proportionally exaggerated style typical of chibi designs, characterized by a larger head and smaller body. This stylization is consistent with the artistic choices seen in chibi characters, which aim for a cute and approachable aesthetic rather than realistic human proportions. There are no visible distortions or artifacts; the character appears cohesive and visually credible within the context of this style.",

      "question": "Are the playful raindrops surrounding the chibi character visually credible and integrated naturally into the scene without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the raindrops are stylized and evenly distributed around the chibi character, adding to the whimsical and playful atmosphere of the scene. They are rendered in a way that suggests they are part of the intended artwork rather than extraneous or poorly integrated elements. The raindrops do not show any artifacts or inconsistencies with the rest of the image, maintaining a coherent look.",

      "question": "Is the oversized, brightly colored umbrella visually consistent with the chibi character and the environment, without causing any unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the umbrella matches the scale of the chibi character, fitting the exaggerated style typical in chibi designs. Its colors are vibrant and align with the playful theme of the image. The textures and contours of the umbrella appear smooth and cohesive, and there are no signs of unnatural textures or distortions, maintaining consistency with the overall style of the scene.",

      "question": "Do the wall and drainpipe maintain their realistic appearance and function, with the water flow interacting naturally with the ground, without any visible artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall and drainpipe retain a semblance of realistic design found in stylized environments, with subtle textures that suggest a real-world surface. The water flow from the drainpipe looks artistically consistent and appears to interact naturally with the ground, pooling appropriately without any obvious artifacts or unrealistic distortions.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the green jacket and boots of the chibi character retain their natural textures and fine details, avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green jacket and boots of the chibi character are depicted with smoothness and detail characteristic of stylized renderings. They maintain their distinct color and form, consistent with the chibi art style. The textures are simple yet clean, without any evident loss of detail or the presence of unnatural artifacts. This approach is typical of designs intended to highlight whimsy and simplicity.",
