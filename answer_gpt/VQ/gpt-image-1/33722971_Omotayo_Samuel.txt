    "Question": "Q1: Do the facial features on each suitcase align naturally with the object’s shape without distorting its geometry or creating unnatural protrusions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the suitcases have animated facial features that complement their shapes. The blue suitcase at the top has a face that fits its rectangular shape, and the brown suitcase below has features that match its squarish form. The facial features do not cause distortion or unnatural protrusions; they are consistent with the overall shapes, similar to how faces are designed on animated characters.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the figure have five fingers per hand, with natural hand shape and joint alignment, and no anatomical deformities or missing limbs?",
    "explanation": "The edited image shows a figure wearing a coat with hands in pockets, making the fingers not visible. Consequently, it's not possible to determine if the figure has five fingers per hand or verify their natural shape and alignment. Thus, no conclusion can be drawn about any anatomical correctness in this aspect.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the world map backdrop properly aligned with the scene’s perspective and does it integrate seamlessly without warping or clipping?",
    "explanation": "The backdrop in Image B shows a world map that is positioned behind the main subjects within the display case. It is aligned with the perspective of the scene, seamlessly integrated into the environment without any apparent warping or clipping issues.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the display case fully enclosing the scene with correct proportions, no clipping of elements, and realistic glass transparency or reflections?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays a display case that frames the scene, creating a visual enclosure that maintains proportionality. There are no indications of element clipping within the case, and while the glass of the display case could exhibit more realistic reflections or transparency, the current depiction is consistent within the style of a framed artwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are all fine details (e.g., stitching, hair, texture edges) preserved and free from blurring, ghosting, or pixelation after editing?",
    "explanation": "The edited image maintains a high level of detail on various elements like the texture of the coats, the hair, and the suitcase material. There are no apparent signs of blurring, ghosting, or pixelation which means the fine details are well-preserved in the editing process.",
