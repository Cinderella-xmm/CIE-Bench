    "Question": "Q1: Are the gold-finished surfaces of both cheetah figures smooth, reflective, and free of unnatural textures or patches that suggest digital artifacting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetah figures are depicted with a gold finish. The smoothness and reflectiveness of the surface are verified by observing the uniform gleam across the figures, indicating a polished metallic texture. There are no visible patches, lines, or disruptions that would suggest digital artifacting, which can often appear as sharp edges or pixelation. Therefore, based on the visual examination, the figures do feature smooth and reflective surfaces, free of any unnatural textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the translucent green-tinted glass façade maintain clean, continuous edges and realistic light transmission without visible distortion or abrupt transitions at its boundaries?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure is a green-tinted glass façade. Observing this area shows that the edges are straight, and the light transmission appears consistent and realistic. There is no noticeable distortion or abrupt color transition at the edges, which would indicate a digital anomaly. The technique for creating glass typically involves maintaining continuous edges, and the image reflects this through the smooth transition and light behavior.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the text 'Savanna Essence' clearly visible, correctly positioned on the base, and rendered with sharp edges and consistent font style without blurring or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "The text 'Savanna Essence' on the base of the figures in Image B is clearly seen. The font style is consistent, with evenly sharp edges, indicating high-resolution text rendering. Additionally, the position of the text is centralized and aligned correctly on each base, suggesting precision in placement. There are no signs of blurring or misalignment, which points to a quality rendering process.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the transformed cheetah figures maintain their original sitting posture and anatomical proportions, with no visible elongation, compression, or deformation of limbs or torso?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the golden cheetah figures maintain a sitting posture with anatomical proportions resembling those of real cheetahs. The limbs and torso show coherent and proportional arrangement without any distortion. The transition from ceramic to gold doesn't seem to affect their original posture or anatomical correctness, which is crucial for maintaining visual realism in model transformations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the two golden cheetah-bottle figures symmetrically aligned with the central glass façade, and do they cast consistent shadows that match the lighting direction and surface reflection?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both cheetah figures are symmetrically aligned to each side of the central green glass façade. This symmetry is affirmed by comparing the relative positions of the bottles to the central object. Furthermore, the shadows under the cheetahs appear consistent with the lighting direction as determined by the reflection from both the glass and the base, lending realism to the arrangement and overall composition integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
