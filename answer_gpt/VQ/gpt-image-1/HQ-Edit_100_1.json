    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the tree in the edited image maintain natural branch proportions and trunk thickness relative to the surrounding elements, without appearing unnaturally shrunk or warped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the tree's branches and trunk are proportionate when compared to the meadow and sky. The branches spread symmetrically, and the trunk has a solid thickness, consistent with common tree morphology. There is no visible distortion or shrinking suggesting unnatural warping, maintaining a natural appearance in the context given by the surrounding landscape elements.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the tree's bark and leaves consistent with natural materials, showing no signs of digital over-enhancement such as repeating patterns or unnatural gloss?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree's bark and leaves appear to be stylized rather than realistic, but they do not show signs of digital over-enhancement like repeating patterns or unnatural gloss that are typically indicative of low-quality digital edits. The texture in the leaves, while painterly, suggests natural foliage without artificial appearances.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the flower patches beneath the tree uniformly distributed and blended into the existing meadow, without visible cloning artifacts, sharp edges, or color inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the flower patches are evenly distributed across the meadow, blending seamlessly into the terrain. There are no visible artifacts, sharp edges, or abrupt color inconsistencies that would indicate poor editing or cloning effects. The flowers are integrated well into the overall meadow scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background behind the tree seamlessly blended, with no visible layering lines, color jumps, or flat regions that break the illusion of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in the edited image features a clear sky with clouds and grass fields transitioning into the horizon. There are no visible layering lines, color jumps, or flat regions, allowing the scene to maintain an illusion of depth consistent with natural landscapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cloud figures positioned above the scene on thin, non-visible wires, appearing small and light enough to suggest suspension, without overlapping or intersecting with the tree or ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds are depicted as hanging elements within the frame, positioned on thin, non-visible wires. They appear light and small, appropriately suggesting suspension above the scenery without intersecting or overlapping with the tree or ground elements in the image. The artistic style gives a surreal but orderly appearance to their presence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the wooden frame clearly visible around the scene with consistent material appearance, straight edges, and proper shadowing that indicates a three-dimensional box structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden frame in the edited image is distinctly visible, with a consistent texture that suggests wood grain material. The edges are straight, and the frame is shown with shadowing and depth cues that support a three-dimensional appearance, consistent with how a real wooden box frame would look.",
