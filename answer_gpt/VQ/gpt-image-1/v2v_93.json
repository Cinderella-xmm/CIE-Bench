      "question": "Does the 3D cartoon style of the thermometer maintain its structural consistency without introducing unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thermometer maintains a consistent 3D cartoon style with smooth curves and uniform structures. The circular shape is perfectly regular, and the various elements (such as numbers and needle) are rendered without any visible distortion or awkward angles. This is achieved through a coherent design typically found in 3D styled illustrations aimed at preserving the integrity of physical objects in a cartoon manner. The absence of broken geometric shapes or abnormalities indicates that the cartoon styling has been applied with attention to maintaining structural consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the soft lighting effects on the thermometer's metallic surface natural, enhancing its finish without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the thermometer with soft lighting effects that appear natural and contribute positively to its finish. The lighting highlights the metallic rim with subtle reflections that are consistent with how light interacts with metal surfaces. It's designed to provide depth and dimension without creating textures that do not belong to metal nor do they obscure the thermometer's details. Such lighting helps enhance the realism in CG models, effectively showing a polished metallic texture that is believable within the visual context.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the added stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] appear naturally integrated into the design without causing visual clutter or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stats regarding the temperature range and accuracy are integrated in a way that seems visually coherent with the overall design framework. The text is placed on a panel that matches the style and colors of surrounding elements, and the typography aligns with the generally cartoonish yet professional aesthetic of the image. These additions do not detract from the visual flow, nor do they make the design feel cramped or overloaded, thus maintaining clarity and harmony with other components.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the title banner and nameplate text elements positioned logically and clearly visible, contributing to the overall visual credibility without disrupting the layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title banner and nameplate in Image B are positioned at the top and bottom of the thermometer respectively. Each is framed by a decorative border that corresponds with the overall stylistic theme. The visibility of these elements is clear, and their arrangement above and below the central focus—the thermometer—provides logical spaces for reading informational text, contributing to the image's visual credibility by framing the thermometer within the broader context of a professionally designed gauge.",

      "question": "Do the crisp borders and cool-toned background complement the thermometer's function and appearance, maintaining a professional and authentic look without introducing visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a thermometer panel set against a cool-toned background with crisp borders. This choice of backdrop and outlining enhances the professional aesthetic by drawing focus to the central elements and ensuring a clean visual presentation. The blue tones provide a contrast to the thermometer, making it stand out without overpowering the subject matter. The design choices reflect an understanding of color theory to sustain the authenticity of the scientific instrument, free of artifacts that might distract or degrade its perceived function.",
