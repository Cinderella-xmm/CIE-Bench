      "question": "Are the illustrated blueberries and text labels seamlessly integrated into the pie surface without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie is depicted with an illustration of blueberries and text labels indicating its nutritional benefits. The blueberries and text are cartoon-like and part of an illustrative style image rather than a photographic representation. Given the context, which is an infographic style, we do not observe pixelation, jagged edges, or shadow inconsistencies within the style presented. The design and layout of the infographic are typically focused on being clean and clear. Therefore, the elements are seamlessly integrated within the context of the style used.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the anthropomorphic version of the mug retain the original cylindrical shape and handle position without stretching, warping, or breaking the object's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug has been anthropomorphized into a character with facial features and arms. Despite this transformation, the mug retains its cylindrical shape and the handle stays in a realistic position. The transformation is done in an illustrative manner that does not warp or break the basic recognizable form of a mug.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the chart positioned clearly within the frame without overlapping or obscuring the pie slice, mug, or plate, and does it have clean lines and legible text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is an infographic where the pie and mug are illustrated with textual elements. The layout shows these elements and text clearly separated into different sections, ensuring none overlap or obscure critical parts of each other. Infographics are designed for clarity, so text is legible with clean lines, enhancing readability and visual appeal.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the warm pastel tones applied evenly across the scene without causing unnatural discoloration of the ceramic, glass, or baked pie surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene employs a warm pastel color scheme typical of infographic style, which does not aim to reflect realistic textures or colors of materials like ceramics or baked goods. Rather, it uses flat colors for stylization purposes. Under this stylized approach, there is no unnatural discoloration because the intention is to abstract rather than to imitate real-life materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the pie slice, mug, plate, and table maintain their original geometric forms and spatial relationships without any visible warping, fragmentation, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is a stylized infographic, the pie slice, mug, and related elements are designed to maintain clear and straightforward geometric forms typical of illustrations. There is no warping or fragmentation observable because the style purposefully uses consistent shapes and spatial organization to communicate the infographic's message effectively.",
