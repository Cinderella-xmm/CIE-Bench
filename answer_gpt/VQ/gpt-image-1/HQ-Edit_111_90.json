      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the metal filigree patterns and gemstone placements on the transformed necklace clearly defined and free from geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metal filigree patterns and gemstone placements are seen within a glass dome. The intricate details of the filigree appear smoothly defined, with no obvious distortions; the gemstones are positioned consistently along the central axis, maintaining a symmetrical arrangement that suggests clarity and precision in design. The absence of geometric distortions or irregularities indicates the patterns and placements are intact.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the snake tail maintain its original scaly texture and smooth curvature as it emerges from the mossy bank without sudden breaks or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snake tail in Image B retains a highly detailed scaly texture, characterized by discernible scales and a consistent curvature without abrupt directional changes or artificial bends, giving the appearance of fluid motion akin to a natural snake. Its integration with the mossy bank is seamless, aiding in maintaining its natural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass dome visually transparent with consistent reflections and refractions across its surface, showing no jagged edges or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B exhibits transparency, allowing the viewer to see the contents clearly. Refractive effects contribute to the realistic portrayal of glass, with reflections adding depth to the surface visual. Edges are smooth and artifact-free, suggesting a polished and consistent rendering of the dome.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the emerald pond display natural water surface details such as subtle ripples and reflections, and are the silver leaves evenly shaped with consistent metallic highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the emerald pond reflects a naturalistic water surface through visible ripples and highlights, mirroring the surroundings to enhance realism. Similarly, the silver leaves are depicted with consistent dimensions and glossy highlights akin to metallic shine, ensuring uniformity and natural intervention with other elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the ornate branches supporting the chandelier proportionally sized and shaped to resemble natural plant structures without angular breaks or unnatural joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branches in Image B possess an organic quality, replicating the form and structure typical of natural branches. Their curvature and proportionate size contribute to an authentic depiction, without any angular or unnatural breaks that would disrupt a natural appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the new elements (pond, leaves, branches, dome) properly overlap and interact with the original necklace and snake tail without floating disjointedly or violating depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements in Image B, including the pond, leaves, branches, and dome, appear to be interacting seamlessly with the original necklace and snake tail. The spatial arrangement suggests they are cohesively integrated, respecting depth and spatial relations, avoiding any disjointed or floating appearances.",
