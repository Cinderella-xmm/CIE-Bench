      "question": "Does the character's 3D chibi appearance maintain structural consistency and visual credibility without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the character is presented as a 3D chibi figure inside a snow globe. This style is typically characterized by exaggerated features for cuteness, such as a larger head and smaller body proportions, which are evident here. The character maintains consistent proportions typical of the chibi style, and no visible distortions or artifacts are apparent. The textures and shadows are applied correctly, contributing to the overall visual credibility of the character's chibi form.",

      "question": "Are the tiny evergreen trees and miniature mountain peaks inside the snow globe depicted with natural textures and shapes, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements within the snow globe, including evergreen trees and mountain peaks, are modeled with careful attention to texture and shape. They reflect a realistic portrayal of these natural elements in a miniature scale. Their forms appear consistent and free from any blurring or unnatural distortions, which indicates the quality and detail of the imagery within the snow globe setting.",

      "question": "Do the icy reflections and gentle sparkles created by the soft daylight filtering through the frosty window appear natural and free from unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The soft daylight filtering through the frosty window creates subtle reflections and sparkles on the snow globe's surface. This effect is consistent with how light refracts and plays off glass surfaces in reality, displaying a natural gradation and highlighting that does not present any digital artifacts or unnatural refractions. The lighting treatment enhances the scene's realism and depth.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe resting atop a stone pedestal near a frosty window integrate seamlessly with the snowy mountain range outside, maintaining visual plausibility without any obvious distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe and its pedestal appear well-integrated with the setting, characterized by a background of a snowy mountain range visible through the frosty window. The environment complements the scene inside the snow globe without any visible proportion or alignment discrepancies, which maintains the plausibility and cohesiveness of the overall visual composition.",

      "question": "Do the character's shield and sword retain their proper shapes and proportions within the 3D chibi style, avoiding any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shield and sword held by the character in the edited image are crafted to fit within the chibi aesthetic, featuring slightly exaggerated yet cohesive proportions. They maintain their iconic form suitable to the style without any warping or unnatural distortions. The detailing in these items also reflects a high level of craftsmanship and attention to maintaining their proper representation within the 3D chibi design.",
