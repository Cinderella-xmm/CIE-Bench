      "question": "Does the enamel pin design maintain the structural coherence of the rocking chair without introducing broken geometric shapes or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) presents a cartoon-style representation of the rocking chair, where the geometric shapes and textures are deliberately simplified for stylistic purposes. The curves and joins of the rocking chair are smoothly integrated without broken or unnatural elements, maintaining coherence in design. This simplification does not disrupt the overall integrity of the chair's structure.",

      "question": "Are there no additional details or elements in the enamel pin design that do not align with the original rocking chair's simplicity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B simplifies the structure of the rocking chair, capturing its essential elements without adding unnecessary details. The chair's back, arms, and rockers are clearly depicted without extraneous decorations, maintaining the simplicity found in the original chair's design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the shiny metal outlines and bold enamel colors appear consistent and natural throughout the enamel pin design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts the rocking chair with bold, flat colors typical of enamel pins, accented by metallic outlines. These design elements are used uniformly across the chair, creating a consistent appearance that aligns with the aesthetics expected in enamel pins, where vibrant colors and clarity are emphasized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the various parts of the rocking chair preserved accurately in the enamel pin design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the stylized representation, the fundamental proportions of the rocking chair - such as the height of the backrest relative to the seat, and the curvature and length of the rockers - are preserved. The now cartoonish design respects these relationships, allowing it to be recognizably a rocking chair.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the enamel pin design against a plain white background with the design itself centered in what appears to be a square format. This presentation method highlights the pin by eliminating external distractions ensuring clarity and focus on the pin itself.",
