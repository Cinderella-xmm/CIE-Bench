        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the gymnast appear proportionate. The angles at the joints such as the elbows, knees, and ankles, exhibit natural and expected bending appropriate for the depicted pose on a balance beam. There are no signs of missing segments or exaggerated bends, which could disrupt the fluidity and realism of the movement displayed.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, each gymnast is fully contained within the respective panel. Key elements such as the gymnast's head and the balance beam are not split or truncated by the boundaries, ensuring the figures and associated objects are visible in their entirety within a single frame.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a dark walnut frame that appears to have a consistent texture and depth, appropriate with wooden style frames.
