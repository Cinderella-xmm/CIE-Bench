      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the atom illustration placed in the same location as the original dough and does it have a smooth, continuous edge without jagged lines or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the atom illustration is centrally positioned in the image, similarly to where the dough is located in Image A. Upon examining the edges of the atom illustration in Image B, they appear smooth and continuous without any jagged lines or noticeable gaps, suggesting a clean digital illustration compared to the irregularities that might be present in a physical dough cut. This suggests that the atom illustration has been placed thoughtfully and clearly in the same typical central spot where a main item would be, with clean edges indicative of digital rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the additional atom-shaped cookies the same size as the original dough and do they have colors that blend naturally with the beige dough and wooden background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the additional atom-shaped cookies vary in size, but generally appear smaller than the original dough in Image A. Additionally, the cookies in Image B are displayed with a variety of distinct colors, such as blues and yellows, which do not naturally blend with the beige dough color of Image A or the wooden background seen in Image A. These colorful cookies contrast quite distinctly, suggesting a deliberate design choice rather than a natural or seamless aesthetic blend.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arrows point directly to the correct parts of the atom (electrons, protons, neutrons) without crossing over or distorting the atomic shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrows are meant to guide attention to specific features or components of the illustration of atoms and cookies. However, these arrows are not pointing directly or precisely to corresponding scientific components of an atom such as electrons, protons, and neutrons. Instead, they seem to point to different styled cookies, presumably correlating to the atom's components in a thematic way. The layout of the arrows also shows crossing over in some places, potentially causing visual distortion of the layout rather than directness or scientific accuracy.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the title text \"Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry\" clearly visible, positioned above the illustrations, and does it not overlap with the atom shapes or cookie cutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title is displayed at the top of the image and reads 'Atoms: & Cookies.' Although part of the text is visible, the full title 'A Sweet Chemistry' is incompletely and incorrectly rendered as 'A Sweet Chemiestres.' Moreover, the positioning at the top does not overlap with the main atom illustrations in the center or any apparent cookie cutter, maintaining clarity and separation from other elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dotted lines straight, uniformly spaced, and positioned between sections without covering the atom illustrations or cookie cutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, there are no visible dotted lines between sections. The layout consists instead of solid lines, other graphical elements, and texts that segment the image but do not resemble dotted, straight, or uniformly spaced lines traditionally used for demarcation. Consequently, there is no interference or overlay on the atom illustrations or any cookie cutter designs. Thus, the statement regarding dotted lines doesn't apply within this context.",
