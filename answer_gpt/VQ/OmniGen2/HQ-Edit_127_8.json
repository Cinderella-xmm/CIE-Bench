      "question": "Are the stone towers, archway, and knight proportionally scaled and positioned correctly within the glass orb without geometric distortion or unnatural perspective shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone towers, archway, and knight are encapsulated within a glass orb, suggesting a miniature representation. Visually, these elements are balanced and appear proportional to each other, fitting well within the spherical constraint of the orb without any visible geometric distortion. The perspective is naturally adjusted to maintain the integrity of the objects' proportions, indicating careful placement and scaling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the stone textures on the towers and gate retain fine detail and natural variation after being minified, without appearing overly smooth or pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon close observation of the stone textures on the towers and gate within the glass orb, the detail is preserved, showcasing intricate patterns and natural variation akin to real stone. The texture management avoids excessive smoothness or pixelation, maintaining a realistic appearance despite the reduced scale compared to Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the antique bronze finish applied uniformly to the knightâ€™s armor and the gate, with realistic tarnish, reflections, and surface depth that match physical metal properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight's armor and the gate display a bronze-like finish. Although the color is consistent and there are highlights suggesting reflections, the realistic tarnish and surface depth typical of physical metal may not be fully achieved. The overall effect lacks some of the subtle imperfections that would indicate tarnish, and the surface depth does not entirely replicate the complexity of metal properties.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the heraldic flags positioned correctly on the battlements, with natural folds and orientation suggesting movement in wind, and no clipping or floating artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flags atop the battlements are placed logically with folds suggesting they are blowing in the wind. The orientation gives a sense of motion consistent with environmental conditions. No clipping or floating artifacts are evident, indicating that the flags were carefully integrated into the scene.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the tiny turrets and crenellated walls around the base of the orb evenly spaced, geometrically accurate, and stylistically consistent with the main castle structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turrets and crenellations appear to be carefully spaced and follow a geometrically accurate pattern. They maintain the stylistic motifs seen in the main castle structure, showing attention to detail and consistency throughout the model's design. The elements harmonize well, emphasizing the cohesion of the miniature construction within the orb.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the golden rays integrated into the glass surface with proper refraction and depth, creating a seamless illusion of light emanating from within the orb without visible layering or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden rays emanating from behind the gate blend into the orb's surface. The effect gives the illusion of light, enhanced by the orb's reflectiveness and the play of refraction, thus avoiding visible layering or edge artifacts. The integration suggests a sophisticated rendering of light within the orb's constraints.",
