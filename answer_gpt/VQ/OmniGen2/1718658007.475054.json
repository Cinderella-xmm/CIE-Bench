      "question": "Are the pastel colors applied to the octopus uniformly distributed without abrupt color shifts or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus presents a smooth, cartoony aesthetic with evenly distributed pastel colors typical of illustrations. The colors show a consistent and clean application with no visible abrupt color changes or pixelation. This choice maintains the integrity of an artistic style that is typically employed in stylized graphics such as advertisements or cartoon products.",

      "question": "Do the brush outlines around the octopus follow the natural curves of its body and tentacles without overlapping or breaking at joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines around the octopus follow a stylized approach consistent with cartoon designs. The curves appear smooth and adhere well to the natural form of the octopus, without any overlap or breakage at the joints of the tentacles, showing skillful artistry in focusing on continuity and keeping the cartoon charm intact.",

      "question": "Are the waves near the shore smooth and consistent in shape, showing natural foam patterns without jagged or broken textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean depicted maintains a simplistic cartoon aesthetic with consistent wave shapes. There are no jagged edges or broken textures present, as the cartoon style usually does not focus on intricate or detailed textures typical of realistic images. The simplicity is intentional to fit the overall stylized approach of the graphic.",

      "question": "Is the text positioned above the horizon line without intersecting clouds or causing visible distortion in the background sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is indeed placed above the horizon line, respecting the sky space without interfering with any clouds. The clean separation between text and background ensures clarity and does not distort the sky, maintaining a tidy design appearance typical of advertisements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the octopus and surrounding terrain align with the direction of the sunset light source and maintain depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B takes a graphic approach that does not involve detailed lighting and shadowing as seen in true-to-life representations in Image A. The cartoon style eschews complex shadow play for flat, engaging colors, so while real shadows aligning with a light source are absent, this choice is deliberate to enhance the stylized aesthetic.",
