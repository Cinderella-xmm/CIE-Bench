      "question": "Do the transformed topiary structures maintain smooth, continuous surfaces and natural-looking textures without visible distortion or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the topiary structures appear to have smooth, continuous surfaces with natural-looking textures. There is no visible distortion or pixelation on these structures, indicating that the transformation maintains an aesthetically pleasing form. The smoothness implies a high-quality edit that preserves the integrity of the topiary shapes.",

      "question": "Does the water in the fountain exhibit consistent transparency and refraction effects, with no unnatural streaks or broken flow patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the water in the fountain with transparent and refractive properties. The water appears to have clear and consistent flow patterns, and there are no visible unnatural streaks or breaks in the water flow. This suggests that the edited water maintains realistic visual effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the spiral vine paths seamlessly integrated into the garden landscape, with gradual transitions and no sudden breaks or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evidence of spiral vine paths that require evaluation for integration or transitions. The garden landscape features hedges, flowers, and a fountain, but no spiral vine paths are visible, indicating this question does not apply to the current image content.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the butterfly-like creatures positioned at varying depths in the scene, with appropriate size scaling and soft edges that match the ambient lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly-like creatures in Image B are placed at different depths in the scene, with some appearing closer to the foreground near the flowers. Their size is appropriately scaled relative to their position in the scene, and they have soft edges that harmonize with the ambient lighting and overall aesthetic of the garden.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the floral crowns positioned at the tops of the topiary structures with natural attachment points and no floating or misaligned petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible floral crowns positioned at the tops of the topiary structures. The topiaries appear clean without any added floral components, indicating that this question does not apply to the edited image.",
