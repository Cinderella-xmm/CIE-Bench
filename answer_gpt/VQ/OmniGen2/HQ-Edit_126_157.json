      "question": "Does the boat exhibit consistent aged wood texture with natural grain patterns and no repeating or unnatural surface artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the boat in Image B exhibits consistent aged wood texture, I examine the visual cues of the boat's material. The boat appears to have a carved appearance with natural grain pattern mimicking real wood, providing an aged and realistic texture. There are no visible repeating patterns or surface artifacts that would indicate artificial or inconsistent texture, thus the image maintains naturalism.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the distant hills rendered with smooth pastel blue gradients that transition naturally without sharp boundaries or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "I analyze the representation of the distant hills in Image B. They are illustrated using smooth pastel blue colors with a gradual transition, emulating real atmospheric conditions. The absence of sharp boundaries and pixelation supports a natural gradation, enhancing the visual appeal and realism of this serene landscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small, clear droplet-like etchings on the water surface that resemble ripples without disrupting the reflection or causing visual distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Regarding the water surface in Image B, I observe the ripple details. The design shows droplet-like etchings which resemble ripples. These etchings are clear, contributing to a realistic depiction of how water typically shows ripple patterns. They do not disrupt the reflection nor cause visual distortion, ensuring coherence and realism in the depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a hand-carved wooden frame surrounding the scene with realistic texture, depth, and structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "I assess the wooden frame's appearance in Image B. The frame shows attributes characteristic of hand-carved wood, such as texture and depth which endows it with structural coherence and realism. The close-up view reveals grain and texture indicative of wood, enhancing its credibility as a carved wooden frame.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the boat, water, and hills arranged in layered 3D cutouts with correct spatial depth and no misalignment or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine spatial and structural arrangements, I have to evaluate the layered appearance of the objects in Image B. All elements—the boat, water, and hills—are strategically layered to create a convincing scene with appropriate spatial depth. These arrangements appear harmonious without misalignment or floating elements, which confirms sound structural assembly.",
