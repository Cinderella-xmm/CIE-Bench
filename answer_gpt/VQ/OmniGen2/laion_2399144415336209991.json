      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the enhanced beads on the bride's shoulder straps evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the fabric's surface without appearing detached or unnaturally sharp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects resembling beads on the cartoon bride's dress are part of stylized details typical in cartoon illustrations. They appear as part of the coherent design without focusing on texture or alignment with fabric, differing from real-world bead placement, which would be more natural and aligned with fabric in Image A. Based on this stylized context, the beads maintain consistency with the cartoon style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the enlarged lapel of the groom's suit proportionally consistent with the rest of the jacket, and does it retain a smooth edge without jagged lines or distorted angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the groom's suit is depicted in a stylized cartoon manner. The lapel appears proportionally consistent with the rest of his suit as intended in cartoon designs, maintaining smooth edges. Cartoon illustrations typically ensure simplicity and flow in shapes, avoiding jagged lines and distortions seen in some lower-quality artwork. Image A's real suit appears well-fitted and detailed naturally. The cartoon maintains these key proportions and edges smoothly within its style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the hands in the \"holding hands\" pose have five fingers each, correctly aligned joints, and natural skin texture without distortion or overlapping limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are depicted in a cartoon style, where realism in finger count and alignment might not mirror real-world expectations precisely. Cartoon hands often simplify these details for stylistic effect, focusing on expressive gestures rather than anatomical correctness. Given this approach, exact finger count and joint alignment may not be accurate, as tar reduced complexity is typical of cartoon portrayals. Contrast with Image A shows realistic counting and alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the heart-shaped border fully contained around the couple without cutting into their bodies or clothing, and are the gold trim and floral engravings clearly defined without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heart-shaped border is visually set around the characters, typical of cartoon styles to ensure coherent compositional elements. The gold trim and floral engravings display clear design lines, lacking blurring or misalignment, essential in polished graphic design to maintain visual clarity. No evidence of border intrusion into character elements supports its complete containment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cartoonized features of both the bride and groom uniformly stylized, with consistent line work and shading that do not clash with each other or create abrupt transitions in texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exemplifies a cartoon style, where uniformity in portrayal is crucial to aesthetic coherence. The bride and groom's features in the cartoon are stylized with consistent line work and shading typical of vector graphics, illustrating a smooth transition without texture disparities. This stylization aligns with the cartoon norm, where abruptness is minimized in favor of flowing, consistent visuals.",
