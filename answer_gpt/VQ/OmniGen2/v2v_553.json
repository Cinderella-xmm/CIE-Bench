      "question": "Do the robes worn by the panda mage have a natural texture and material appearance without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robes in Image B have a cartoon-like appearance with smooth and clean lines due to the overall cartoonish style of the illustration. They appear to have a natural and consistent texture within the context of this artistic style, which is more focused on stylization rather than realistic texture, but no visible artifacts are apparent. The color shading is even, and the borderlines of the robes are crisp and clean.",

      "question": "Does the glowing staff held by the panda mage blend naturally into the image without introducing unnatural light effects or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing staff held by the panda mage emits a light that is consistent with the cartoon style of the rest of the image. The glow is well integrated into the scene without creating unnatural light effects or distortions. The soft glow effects and shadows are rendered in a manner that is consistent with other light sources typically depicted in this artistic style.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the panda mage and the white horse visually credible and structurally consistent with each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions between the panda mage and the white horse are consistent with the stylized cartoon aesthetics. Both characters appear to be part of the same fantastical world and maintain proportions that are credible within this context. The panda mage rides comfortably on the horse, and their sizes align well with character design that is more whimsical and less realistic.",

      "question": "Does the background enhance the magical and harmonious theme without showing any unnatural textures or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a stylized forest that complements the magical theme of the illustration. It features soft lighting and consistent shading that harmonizes with the overall aesthetic. There are no unnatural textures or inconsistencies; the background's artistic elements contribute to a cohesive and magical atmosphere.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the panda mage's face and expression appear natural and coherent without any signs of distortion or unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred face, this aspect cannot be evaluated. The assessment focuses on coherence and harmony of the character design, and the blurred image prevents a full judgment on facial expressions or detail integrity.",
