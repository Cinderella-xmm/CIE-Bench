      "question": "Does the addition of the \"Clean First\" slogan in the top left corner maintain the natural appearance and does not introduce any obvious artifacts like blurry edges or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Clean First' slogan in the top left corner is added on a red banner with white text, which contrasts distinctly against the neutral tiled wall. The edges of the text and banner appear sharp and consistent, and there is no evident blurring or mismatched lighting effects around the slogan region. This addition does not appear to introduce any noticeable visual artifacts, maintaining a natural appearance against the background.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the \"Comfort Always\" slogan added in the bottom right corner visually credible, maintaining structural consistency and not causing any distortion or degradation of the surrounding tiles' texture and details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'Comfort Always' slogan in Image B, divided into 'Comfort.' at the top and 'ALWAYS' at the bottom, is placed on red banners with white text. This section does not visibly distort the tile patterns or textures around it, and the tiles appear to align correctly without noticeable misalignment or degradation of details. This suggests that the addition is visually credible and integrates well with the image's structure.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the fonts and styles of both slogans blend naturally with the background, avoiding any unnatural textures or interruptions in the tile patterns behind them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the fonts in the slogans are distinct and use bold white text on a red background for visibility, they do not induce any unnatural textures or interruptions in the tile pattern. The tiles remain visible where they should be, and the transitions between the text and the tile background appear smooth without any peculiar artifacts or texture issues, indicating that the slogans blend with the image naturally.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sizes and placements of the \"Clean First\" and \"Comfort Always\" slogans create a balanced composition that complements the image without overwhelming the toilet and its setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The slogans in Image B are strategically placed at opposite corners: 'Clean First' in the top left and 'Comfort Always' in the bottom right. This placement helps maintain balance in the image and supplements the central focus on the toilet. The sizes of the text are appropriate and proportional relative to the overall image, ensuring they are readable yet not overpowering. Therefore, the composition remains balanced and complements the setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the slogans aligned in a way that respects the geometric shapes of the tiled walls and floor, ensuring the structural and visual coherence of the entire image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The slogans in Image B are situated such that they adhere to the orientations of the wall tiles â€” aligned horizontally in a way that respects the grid-like geometry of the wall and floor tiles. This alignment maintains the structural agreement with the geometric pattern of the existing environment, preserving visual coherence and ensuring that the slogans appear as deliberate inclusions rather than disrupting elements.",
