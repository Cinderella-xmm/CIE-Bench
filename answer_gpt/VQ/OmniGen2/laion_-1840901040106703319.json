      "question": "Are the crystal facets on the cabin’s walls, roof, and windows evenly shaped and aligned with the original cabin’s triangular and rectangular outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is clearly a prismatic crystal form with sharp, angular facets, diverging significantly from the triangular and rectangular outlines of a traditional cabin. The design features symmetrical geometric shapes such as polygons, typical of crystal formations rather than building structures. In comparison, Image A displays a log cabin with a steep triangular roof and rectangular window frames, constructed using wood. The shapes are defined by traditional architectural lines and corners. Therefore, Image B’s facets do not align with or retain the original cabin’s outlines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the blue and green hues on the crystal surfaces show variations in transparency and light reflection consistent with real glass or crystal, rather than uniform solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the crystal structure with a spectrum of blue and green hues, demonstrating variations in light transparency and reflection. These hues often indicate that the material is of a glass or crystal nature, where different angles and thickness create varying degrees of color intensity and reflection. Real glass or crystal naturally refracts and reflects light, producing a range of tones and transparency, which is observable in the changing hues across the facets.",

      "question": "Are the vertical support beams and horizontal railings converted into crystal forms that maintain their original spacing, height, and alignment with the cabin’s frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a standalone crystal sculpture without any beams or railings that convey the characteristics of a building frame. Unlike Image A, which shows a wooden cabin structure with aligned beams and railings, Image B lacks any vertical or horizontal architectural elements, focusing instead on the unified crystalline shape. There is no maintenance of the cabin's spacing, height, or alignment in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white marble platform beneath the cabin flat, continuous, and free of cracks or irregularities, and does it extend evenly under the entire base of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the white marble platform appears smooth, flat, and continuous without visible cracks or flaws. It provides a consistent foundation that uniformly supports the crystal structure above. The unbroken surface of the marble suggests a singular, polished slab, typical of a constructed platform or pedestal designed to display art or installations, rather than an uneven or cracked surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the small crystal formations along the base of the cabin proportionally smaller than the main structure, grouped in clusters, and positioned in a way that suggests natural growth rather than random placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, smaller crystal formations are evident around the base of the larger structure. These smaller crystals are grouped collectively and show a pattern that mimics natural growth settings like mineral deposits around a central formation. This clustered arrangement contrasts with random scattering, characteristic of natural rock or crystal settings, enhancing the perception of the main structure as a naturally developing entity.",
