      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks forming the hot dog uniformly shaped, properly aligned, and free of distorted or misshapen pieces that compromise structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the LEGO bricks forming the hot dog are uniform in shape and appearance, which is typical of the standardized design of LEGO pieces. Each piece appears properly aligned, maintaining structural consistency, which is expected in LEGO constructions due to the interlocking nature of the bricks. There are no visible distortions or misshapen pieces that would affect the structural integrity of the LEGO hot dog.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the ceramic mosaic bottle feature smooth, non-glass-like surfaces with clearly defined geometric patterns in red, yellow, and tan, without unnatural reflections or transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is not made of ceramic mosaic, but rather of LEGO bricks. It has a blocky, brick-like structure with different colored bricks forming the bottle, including colors such as red, yellow, and tan. The surface lacks smoothness typically associated with ceramics and instead has a textured appearance characteristic of LEGO surfaces. There are no unnatural reflections as would be seen in glass-like materials; instead, the structured and defined shape is consistent with LEGO bricks.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the LEGO hot dog's length proportionally consistent with the original hot dogâ€™s size relative to the cutting board and nearby objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the hot dog is placed on a cutting board and appears realistic in size compared to the typical dimensions of hot dogs. In Image B, the LEGO hot dog appears slightly larger and less proportionate compared to its surroundings but overall matches the concept of a playful, exaggerated construction often seen in toy models. LEGO constructions tend to have a scale that may not perfectly align with real-world sizes.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the ceramic bottle have a rounded, flowing shape with no sharp angles or blocky geometry that would disrupt visual harmony with the LEGO hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is constructed from LEGO bricks and exhibits a distinctly blocky geometry typical of LEGO designs. This contrasts with a rounded, flowing shape that might be seen in ceramics. The sharp angles and blocky appearance are characteristic of LEGO constructions and may visually clash with the rounded concept associated with ceramics, though within the thematic design of LEGO, this appearance is harmonious.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden base under both the LEGO hot dog and ceramic bottle seamless, with consistent wood grain and color matching the surrounding table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden bases under both the LEGO hot dog and bottle are consistent in color and match the surrounding table surface aesthetically. However, upon comparing with Image A, the wood grain and texture are smoother and more consistent in Image A. The LEGO recreation may lack the fine detailing of wood grain seen in real wood but maintains color consistency.",
