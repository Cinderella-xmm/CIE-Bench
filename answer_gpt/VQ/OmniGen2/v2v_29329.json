      "question": "Do the proportions of the shirt and tie appear natural and appropriate for the baby's body size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt and tie are noticeably large on the baby's body, which is consistent with the common visual appearance when dressing infants in adult-sized or oversized clothing. Babies are much smaller than adults, and their clothing typically fits in a more snug and proportionate manner. The oversized nature of the shirt and tie seems deliberately styled to look humorous or cute rather than fitting. This is a common photographic style for images of infants dressed in adult-themed or exaggeratively large clothing for comedic or charming effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures of both the shirt and tie appear smooth, with a visible sheen suggesting they are made from a material like cotton or polyester, which would be typical for such garments. The fabric displays natural folds and shadowing, indicating a realistic texture consistent with real fabric materials.",

      "question": "Does the baby's posture and the way the clothes drape over the body look natural and believable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baby's posture is typical of how a baby would be seated, with the legs bent and the torso upright. However, given the oversized nature of the clothing, the clothes drape in an exaggerated fashion over the baby's body, which is not necessarily natural but can be considered believable within the context of what one might expect when dressing an infant in adult-sized clothes. The drape of the clothing seems consistent with the nature of oversized garments rather than indicating any editing faults.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, edges, or inconsistencies where the clothing appears to be edited onto the baby?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a careful examination of the visible parts of the clothing, such as the seams and edges, does not reveal any inconsistencies or signs of poor editing, like mismatched textures, colors, or unnatural joins. The clothing appears to be genuinely worn rather than digitally applied.",
