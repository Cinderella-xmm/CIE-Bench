      "question": "Do the iridescent scales cover the cardinal’s body smoothly without visible seams, pixelation, or inconsistent color gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a cardinal, there's a fiery bird reminiscent of a phoenix rather than featuring iridescent scales on the cardinal’s body. Therefore, the concept of scales is not applicable in this context. The focus is on the flames and firebird appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the flames emerging from the wingtips and tail oriented upward and shaped naturally, without abrupt edges or disconnected fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flames emerging from the wingtips and tail are oriented upward in a manner consistent with how flames typically behave due to rising hot air. The flames appear smooth and continuous, without abrupt edges, maintaining a natural shape akin to tongues of fire. This gives the impression of a cohesive element of the fiery bird design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glowing ember effect confined to the eye area, with no halo bleed onto the surrounding feathers or face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing ember effect around the eye is integrated into the overall fiery theme of the bird. There is an intense glow around the eye area, but it is part of the larger fiery effect that covers much of the bird's body, making it hard to separate any detailed halo effect from the flames. There isn't an apparent bleed distinct from the general fire effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the obsidian branch retain the original branch’s branching pattern and thickness, with a smooth, glassy surface free of cracks or texture inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branch seems more stylized compared to the natural look of the original branch in Image A. The branch generally retains a similar pattern and thickness but doesn't explicitly appear like obsidian with a glassy surface. It's more of an artistic representation with some snow and blossom features. Thus, the complete characteristics of an obsidian branch are not entirely evident.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the flames on the blossoms directly connected to the petals, with no detached or floating flame elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blossoms appear to be engulfed in flames that are directly connected to them, with no visible detached or floating flame elements. The flames are visually integrated with the blossoms, appearing as if part of a unified fiery transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the snowflakes falling around the flaming elements evenly distributed, with no unnatural absence or clustering near the fire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowflakes appear to be distributed throughout the image, maintaining an even pattern even around the fiery elements such as the flames on the wings and flowers. There is no noticeable unnatural absence or clustering of snowflakes in proximity to the fire, suggesting a balanced visual effect.",
