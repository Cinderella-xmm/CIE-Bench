      "question": "Are the metallic textures added to the camera body natural, maintaining the camera's structural coherence without visible artifacts or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera is transformed into a stylized, steampunk version with pronounced metallic textures. The camera body appears cohesive and exhibits a consistent metallic sheen throughout. This styling gives it a unified and coherent appearance typical of steampunk design, where metal surfaces are usually smooth and well-integrated without visible texture errors or notable loss of structural detail.",

      "question": "Does the lens maintain its original proportions and geometric shape, with metallic textures that appear authentic and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lens retains a round, geometric shape that is faithful to the original design found in most camera lenses. The metallic textures applied to it appear balanced and blend naturally with the overall steampunk aesthetic. There are no visible distortions or alterations to its shape, indicating an authentic portrayal of a metallic lens.",

      "question": "Do the tripod legs and head display metallic textures that are consistent with their original structure, avoiding damage to geometry or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tripod in Image B has been visually transformed into a stylized metal version consistent with a steampunk theme. The textures on the legs and head show a coherent metallic appearance, resembling brass or copper. The geometric structure of the tripod is maintained without any anomalies, ensuring that the textures do not interfere with the core geometry or appear unnatural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the Nikon logo and other text labels naturally integrated into the metallic design, remaining legible and consistent with the steampunk style without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text labels, including the 'Nikhon' logo, have been modified to fit the steampunk theme. Although altered, they are highly stylized in a way that matches the overall aesthetic of the image. The integration seems intentional and coherent with the rest of the image's theme, maintaining legibility and style congruence without appearing out of place.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting, shadowing, and reflection on the camera and tripod consistent and realistic within the steampunk illustration style, contributing to the image's natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting, shadow, and reflection in Image B are crafted to match a stylized, steampunk illustration. The shadows and highlights are consistent with a directional light source that's typical of such artistic renderings. The metallic surfaces exhibit formal reflections and additional highlights appropriate for the portrayed material, adding to the image's natural and coherent appearance.",
