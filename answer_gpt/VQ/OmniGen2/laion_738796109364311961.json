      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the muscle proportions of the player in red (player #24) exaggerated but still anatomically plausible without visible distortion or unnatural bulging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player depicted redraws the proportions of muscles, making them visually exaggerated in a stylized, cartoon-like manner typical of comic art. This style often emphasizes features such as bulging muscles and sharp contours. Despite this exaggeration, they remain within the realm of anatomical possibility since comic representations can exaggerate features while still adhering to basic human anatomical rules.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the uniform colors of both players retain natural color gradients and material textures despite increased vibrancy, without appearing oversaturated or flat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vibrant colors used in the uniforms are characteristic of stylized illustrations rather than natural textures. They are uniform in tone with a flat coloring approach typical of graphic art, resulting in a more comic book appearance. This style intentionally lacks the varied gradients and textures found in real life.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the team logos on both players' helmets and jerseys accurately rendered and properly aligned without deformation or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the team logos are drawn in a clearly visible and cleanly rendered manner, typical for illustrations where simplification and clarity are prioritized. The logos are aligned properly on the helmets and jerseys within the stylized depiction, avoiding distortion or pixelation issues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background behind the players stylistically enhanced but still coherent with the foreground, without sudden distortions or loss of detail in the crowd or field markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a background that is consistent with the foreground style of bold, flat colors and simplified shapes. This stylistic choice creates an illustration-based coherence rather than photo-realism, avoiding abrupt distortions typically associated with mismatched styles. The simplified indication of a stadium setting maintains logical coherence with the foreground, although it lacks detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the limbs and body postures of both players maintain structural consistency with real-world biomechanics, even with exaggerated motion, without broken joints or floating limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the players' postures are dynamically portrayed with exaggerated athletic posing, fitting within the realm of comic art that often enhances motion to expressiness. While exaggerated, these depictions adhere to the fundamentals of human biomechanics without appearing as if joints are misaligned or limbs are unnaturally positioned.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the matte black collector's box with transparent lid visually consistent in material, lighting, and perspective, and does it surround the cards without introducing edge artifacts or lighting mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the matte black collector's box is depicted with clear thickness and uniform lighting that preserves material consistency and perspective alignment, typical of high-quality rendered items. The box appears to encapsulate the cards smoothly without showing edge artifacts or mismatched lighting, maintaining visual consistency.",
