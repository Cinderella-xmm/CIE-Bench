    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the arms and face drawn on the pie’s surface consistent with the texture and color of the crust, without visible digital artifacts or mismatched shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie's surface does not have arms and a face drawn on it. The pie maintains a lattice pattern throughout without any additional features like arms or a face. This means there are no digital artifacts or mismatched shading to assess related to arms or a face.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lattice pattern retain its original grid structure and spacing, and does it appear as a draped fabric apron without broken or stretched lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lattice pattern on top of the pie maintains its grid structure and spacing, resembling a typical pie crust lattice. There is no indication that it appears as a draped fabric apron, and there are no broken or stretched lines visible, indicating that it hasn't been altered to resemble fabric.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the knife converted into a feather pen with a realistic quill tip and wooden shaft, and does it maintain a natural transition from the original knife shape without abrupt edges or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife placed on the pie remains a standard knife with a metal blade and wooden handle. There has been no conversion into a feather pen, and there is no quill tip present. Therefore, there are no natural transitions from a knife to a feather pen to evaluate.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the additional pastries positioned at a consistent distance and scale relative to the main pie, and do they cast realistic shadows and reflect the same lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any additional pastries in the frame. The only food item visible is the single pie on the plate. Thus, there are no additional pastries to assess regarding position, scale, or shadow casting.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the text bubbles positioned close to the pie’s mouth, legible, and free from overlapping or clipping with the pie or plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text bubbles are positioned close to the pie, ensuring the speech effect is maintained without overlapping or clipping with the pie or plate. The text within the bubbles is clear and legible, contributing to the humorous tone.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the hands on the pie have exactly five fingers each, proper joint alignment, and a natural grip on the feather pen without deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no added arms or hands on the pie. The image focuses on the pie itself with lattice detailing and text bubbles, without any depiction of hands grasping a feather pen. Therefore, there are no fingers or joints to evaluate for natural alignment or grip.",
