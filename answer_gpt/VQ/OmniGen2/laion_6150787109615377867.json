      "question": "Does the gear surface on the tabletop show consistent metallic sheen and detailed engravings without blurred or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop has a metallic sheen that is consistent across its surface, which indicates high-quality rendering. The engravings are detailed, showcasing intricate patterns that are clearly visible without any signs of blurring or jagged edges. This suggests thorough attention to detail in the depiction of this steampunk-inspired design, maintaining clarity and precision.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the piston-driven limbs symmetrically arranged and proportionally scaled to the central column, with clearly defined joints and no bent or broken segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piston-driven limbs are symmetrically arranged around the central column, indicating balance in the design. The joints of these limbs are clearly defined, and they do not appear bent or broken, which shows careful design and scaling proportional to the column. This highlights the mechanical aesthetic typical of steampunk art.",

      "question": "Are the steam vents evenly spaced along the central column and properly embedded into the metal surface without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam vents in Image B are evenly spaced along the central column, suggesting an organized design. They are integrated seamlessly into the metal surface, without looking detached or misaligned. This attention to alignment and embedding is crucial for maintaining the cohesive and functional design characteristic of steampunk machinery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cog patterns and dials on the base have intact geometric shapes with uniform spacing and no overlapping or incomplete features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cog patterns and dials on the base are depicted with intact geometric shapes, and they are uniformly spaced. There are no overlapping or incomplete features, which indicates a meticulous design ensuring functional and aesthetic harmony, important in steampunk art.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brass and copper accents clearly differentiated from the silver metal by color and reflectivity, without unnatural gradients or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly differentiates the brass and copper accents from the silver metal through distinct color and reflectivity. The brass and copper parts shine with a warm hue, while the silver parts have a cooler metallic sheen. There are no unnatural gradients or texture artifacts, signifying skilled rendering and adherence to the steampunk style known for its use of varied metals.",
