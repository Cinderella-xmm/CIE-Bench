    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the magnifying glass placed among the books on the left bookshelf visually consistent in size, shape, and material, with a shadow extending toward the desk that matches the lighting direction from the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the magnifying glass is visibly located on the right, not on the left bookshelf. It features a wooden handle and is consistent in size and shape with common magnifying glasses. The shadow direction is logically extending towards the left along the window's sunlight direction, which is accurate with the angle of light presented. Image A does not feature any magnifying glass. Despite the error in bookshelf positioning, the shadow direction aligns with the lighting source.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the ghostly outline of the detective in a trench coat appear as a translucent, softly blended form within the stained-glass window pattern, maintaining the integrity of the original design and showing no jagged edges or inconsistent opacity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detective silhouette is clearly integrated into the stained-glass window and blends into the scene without disrupting the window's design integrity. There are no jagged edges visible, and the opacity is consistent, suggesting an effective merging of elements. Image A has no detective outline, allowing a direct observation of the consistency and clarity in the edited image when comparing it.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the deep sepia tones applied consistently across all surfaces including the wooden desk, bookshelves, floor, and window, preserving fine details like wood grain and book spines without introducing blotchy or uneven color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a color palette that maintains sepia tones across various elements, like wood texture and book spines, showing consistency without blotchiness. Image A shares a similar color theme, enabling comparison for uniform color application without loss of detail in both images. The edited scene does not disrupt the sepia effect, based on the visible factors.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the title \"The Lost Legacy\" positioned at the top of the image in a bold serif font that is clearly legible, proportionally scaled, and seamlessly overlaid without obscuring the ceiling details or causing visual disruption to the surrounding ornate patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title is placed at the top in a serif font, legible and proportional to the ornate background, without obscuring intricate ceiling details. The placement and style create minimal visual disruption. Image A lacks any text, allowing this comparison of the overlay integration without pattern alteration.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the added elements—the magnifying glass and the ghostly figure—integrate seamlessly into the scene without distorting adjacent objects, altering lighting logic, or introducing visible artifacts such as misaligned edges or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added elements in Image B, the magnifying glass, and the ghostly silhouette, integrate logically without distorting adjacent objects or affecting the scene's lighting logic. The textures in both objects are consistent, and there are no visible artifacts like misaligned edges or repetitive textures across the scene. Image A, lacking these elements, provides a foundation to confirm the integration's quality in the edited scene.",
