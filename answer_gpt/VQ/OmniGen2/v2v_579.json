      "question": "Does the central green block retain its original geometric shape after being converted into a 3D chibi-style cartoon character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central green block has undergone significant modification. Common sense tells us that chibi-style cartoon characters often feature rounded edges and simplified forms to convey a cute and approachable aesthetic. The green block in Image B has been redesigned with a face and rounded corners, losing its original geometric shape as a standard brick seen in Image A. This transformation indicates that the block does not retain its original geometric shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red blocks redesigned as lively supporting characters free from unnatural textures and maintain their original structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red blocks have been given facial features, limbs, and a rounded cartoonish appearance, consistent with chibi design principles which emphasize cuteness and simplicity. They do not maintain their original structural integrity seen in Image A, where the blocks are standard rectangular bricks. However, the characters do have a natural texture for a cartoon style. Despite looking lively, their structural integrity from Image A is compromised.",

      "question": "Does the transformed background with soft pastel colors blend naturally with the foreground elements without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a pastel pink background that complements the chibi-style cartoon characters. This color choice aligns with creating a soft and friendly atmosphere typical in cartoon imagery. The visual integration of the background with emotionally appealing foreground characters appears seamless without any obvious artifacts or mismatches in style, indicating effective blending.",

      "question": "Are the heart-shaped confetti elements evenly distributed and visually plausible without causing any loss of detail in the surrounding blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases small heart-shaped confetti elements scattered around the characters, contributing to a playful environment typical of cartoon illustrations. While these elements enhance the festive mood, their presence does not obscure or cause a loss of detail in the main block characters. The distribution seems even and supports the overall aesthetic without disrupting the depiction of the main characters.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the red blocks and the central green block maintain a consistent chibi aesthetic without any noticeable inconsistencies in style or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the red blocks and the central green block are transformed into chibi-style characters with rounded edges, emotive facial features, and bright colors. This consistent design approach leads to a unified aesthetic across the image. There are no noticeable inconsistencies in style or texture within the depiction of these blocks as cartoon characters, which supports harmonious visual storytelling typical in such illustrations.",
