      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the fabric folds of the woman's dress clearly defined and consistent with natural draping behavior, without unnatural smoothing or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the draping of the woman's dress is visually analyzed. The fabric folds appear well-defined and flow naturally, following the contours of her body, which is consistent with natural draping seen in clothing. The quality of the image suggests that there is no pixelation or unnatural smoothing, as the folds show variations in light and shadow, indicating a realistic representation of fabric texture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the floral and curvilinear motifs in the background remain continuous and symmetrical, with no visible breaks or misalignments in the decorative framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral and curvilinear motifs surrounding the woman in Image B are checked for continuity and symmetry. These motifs appear entire and symmetrical, flowing smoothly without interruption. The decorative framework around the central figure maintains harmony and balance, indicative of careful design and execution, without any visible breaks or misalignments.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold trim along the perimeter of the image evenly applied, with consistent thickness and reflective properties that match the surrounding lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the gold trim around the perimeter of Image B, it exhibits an even application with consistent thickness throughout. The trim also reflects the surrounding light uniformly, creating a coherent appearance consistent with quality reflective materials. This suggests attention to detail in maintaining consistent visual properties.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the womanâ€™s right hand maintain a natural position with five fingers properly aligned and no deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of the woman's right hand in Image B is scrutinized. The hand is in a natural position, and the alignment of the fingers is anatomically correct, showing the expected number of five digits without any deformities or additional digits. This suggests accurate depiction based on human anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors throughout the image uniformly balanced, with no sudden transitions or patches of unnatural saturation that suggest layering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall color balance is examined. The colors are consistent throughout the image, with no abrupt transitions, patches, or unnatural saturation levels that would indicate layering errors. The harmonious blending of shades and hues across different elements suggests a well-executed color scheme.",
