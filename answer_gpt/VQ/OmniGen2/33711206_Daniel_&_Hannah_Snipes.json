      "question": "Are the eyes of the woman and child enlarged but still aligned with their facial structures without visible distortion or unnatural spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of both the woman and the child appear proportionate and neatly aligned with their facial structures. Observing the relationships between the eyes, nose, and mouth reveals consistent anatomical proportions, which correspond to natural human facial features. No distortion or unusual spacing is noted, indicating the eyes have been rendered in harmony with their surrounding features.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hands of the woman and child show five fingers each, with natural finger curvature and no overlapping or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of both the woman and the child are visible and sufficiently detailed to discern individual fingers. Both the woman and the child display five fingers each with anatomically correct proportions. The curvature of the fingers appears natural, consistent with the resting or interactive positions typical in such poses. There are no indications of overlapping or missing digits.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the color transitions across the woman’s dress, the child’s dress, and the background flowers smooth and free of sharp digital edges or unnatural blotches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases smooth transitions among various colors in the woman's red and white outfit, the child's green dress, and the backdrop's floral elements. The colors blend seamlessly into each other rather than showing digital artifacts or abrupt transitions, which would stand out as irregularities. The result is an image with a cohesive and painterly appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the added floral accents in the background consistent in size, lighting, and texture with the existing flowers and do they cast plausible shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral accents integrate well with the rest of the background elements. The flowers are consistent in size, lighting, and texture, matching their surroundings and maintaining a reasonable scale compared to human subjects. Moreover, any shadows cast by the flowers are consistent with natural lighting effects, contributing to a believable scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the wooden border have uniform thickness, natural wood grain, and proper alignment with the image edges without gaps or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a wooden frame surrounding the image, displaying uniform thickness along all sides. The wood grain appears realistic and natural, which is consistent across the frame. Furthermore, the frame maintains proper alignment with the edges of the image, with no visible gaps or warping which would signify poor construction or manipulation.",
