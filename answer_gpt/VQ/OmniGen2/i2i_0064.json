      "question": "Are the cat's limbs and body proportions appropriate for its new lounging pose on the sofa without appearing unnaturally distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cat is depicted lounging on the sofa with a relaxed pose, which matches the typical reclining posture of cats. Its legs and tail stretch comfortably across the sofa, maintaining natural proportions without seeming too elongated or contorted. From world knowledge, cats often exhibit flexibility, enabling them to rest in various positions comfortably, which is illustrated well in this image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glasses on the cat's face fit naturally and are they free from any visible artifacts such as unnatural texture or alignment issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is wearing glasses that align well with its face. The glasses sit properly over the bridge of the nose and ears, consistent with how glasses would naturally fit on a character with feline features. The texture and alignment are smooth, without any visible artifacts or misalignment issues. This suggests a careful integration of the glasses in the editing process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition between the cat and the living room background smooth, with no distracting edges or mismatches in lighting and shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the cat in a well-lit living room, with harmonious shadows and lighting that match the overall ambient light illuminating both the cat and the background. There are no visible sharp edges or lighting inconsistencies that would suggest a mismatch between elements. This indicates a seamless integration of the cat's image into the living room scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the remote control look naturally placed, with fingers appropriately positioned around the remote, avoiding any anatomical distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat's paw gripping the remote control in Image B is positioned plausibly, as the digits wrap comfortably around the remote in the manner expected if a human were holding it. While cats do not naturally hold objects similarly, the representation is contextually reasonable given the stylized anthropomorphism of pets in illustrations or edits, without any visible distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors and materials used for the cat, the sofa, and the living room consistent and harmonious, contributing to an overall authentic and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the cat's fur harmonize with the rich tones of the living room's furniture and decor. The textures and materials, including the fabric of the sofa and the wood of the furniture, complement the room's soft lighting. Altogether, these elements create a consistent and unified scene, supporting a natural and coherent appearance.",
