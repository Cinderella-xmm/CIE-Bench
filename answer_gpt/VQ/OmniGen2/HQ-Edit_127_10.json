    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the upper and lower tiers clearly defined with consistent perspective and proportional scaling, and is there a visible separation between them that suggests a layered structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a snow globe where the scene within has to adhere to a layered structure given the nature of snow globes which visually create a separation from the base. The image shows clear separation between tiers as the upper tier is enclosed within the glass while the lower tier shows more defined, larger trees and streets leading to a proportional scaling distinction between upper and lower segments. A consistent perspective is maintained as both tiers depict the same scene within the snow globe.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the buildings in the upper tier have a metallic sheen with subtle reflections and gradients that match the lighting direction, and are there no flat or unnaturally uniform color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a snow globe encapsulating an animated version of Paris with metallic structures like the Eiffel Towers. There are subtle reflections evident in their surfaces which match lighting coming from the upper left as seen in the shade of the trees and buildings in the upper tier. The structures within the globe have consistent colors and appear detailed rather than flat.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the trees and bushes in the lower tier composed of irregular, naturally shaped forms with varying heights and densities, and do they lack repeating texture tiles or unnatural symmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees and bushes within the snow globe are stylized but maintain an irregular appearance. They have varying heights and distinct formations without visible repeating textures, suggesting varied densities and shapes typical in modeled landscapes within snow globes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the silvery flakes distributed across the space between tiers with soft edges, slight blurring, and depth-based opacity, indicating movement through air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B takes the form of a snow globe, where silvery flakes can be expected; however, in the visual cues provided, there's no mention or depiction of flakes distributed across the tiers. The image focuses more on the scene encapsulated than environmental effects like snowflakes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base show individually rendered cobblestones with visible grout lines and surface variations, and are the street lamps proportionally sized and evenly spaced along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the image, the base is depicted with a streamlined surface rather than visibly rendered cobblestones or grout lines. Regarding street lamps, they are shown as evenly spaced and proportionally sized considering the stylized layout within the snow globe, focusing more on an ornamental base design rather than realistic cobblestone detailing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are both Eiffel Towers structurally intact with correct lattice patterns, uniform scaling, and no stretched or compressed sections that deviate from their known design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the snow globe of Image B, both Eiffel Towers are depicted with structural integrity, maintaining their iconic lattice pattern and scaling. They are scaled down appropriately to fit within the stylized design of the globe without distortion, adhering to their known architectural layout.",
