    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the steps now display a series of uniformly sized, overlapping scale-like segments that follow the spiral path without visible gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steps appear consistent in size and alignment along the spiral path, without visible gaps or misalignment. The visual cues indicate a uniform and consistent pattern across the steps, suggesting careful composition. Therefore, based on my world knowledge of typical spiral stair design, they seem to have no clear gaps or misalignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the railing now form a continuous, gently curving spine-like structure with consistent thickness and no abrupt changes in direction or width?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon visual examination, the railing maintains a consistent thickness and follows a smooth curve along the spiral. There are no visible abrupt changes in direction or width, suggesting a seamless design. This observation aligns with the typical architectural features of curving staircases, which aim to maintain a harmonious and flowing appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wooden patterns applied to the spine consistent in tone, grain, and texture with the original railing, and do they appear as an integral part of the structure rather than a separate overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden railing exhibits a consistent tone, grain, and texture that matches conventional wooden materials. This visual harmony suggests an integral construction, rather than an added overlay. Common woodwork typically displays uniformity in these aspects when aiming for a cohesive aesthetic.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the stone-like ridges aligned along the outer edge of the spiral coils and smoothly integrated into the surface, without appearing detached or misaligned with the underlying form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows stone ridges aligned along the spiral coil's outer edge, appearing smoothly integrated without visible detachment. This integration is evident from the seamless visual continuity along the stone-like texture, which matches expectations for integrated architectural design where elements are cohesively designed without misalignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the spiral coils decrease in size proportionally toward the center, maintaining smooth curvature and even spacing without compression or stretching that distorts the spiral shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spiral coils proportionally decrease in size toward the center, maintaining smooth curvature and even spacing. This observation is consistent with the mathematical nature of spirals, which often exhibit naturally decreasing dimensions while preserving the overall geometric pattern.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do shadows and highlights on the scales, spine, and ridges follow the contours of the new surface structure, matching the direction and intensity of ambient light from above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, shadows and highlights follow the contours of the structure, suggesting they match the direction of ambient light, which appears to come from above. The shadows and highlights visually align with the three-dimensional depth suggested by the surfaces, indicating coherence in lighting design according to the image details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the edges of the scale segments, spinal bones, and stone ridges clearly defined and free from blurring, aliasing, or stair-stepping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the spiral components are clearly defined and lack visible blurring, aliasing, or stair-stepping artifacts. Based on visual scrutiny, the architectural details exhibit precise lines which contribute to a sharp, clean aesthetic, typical in high-quality architectural photography or illustration.",
