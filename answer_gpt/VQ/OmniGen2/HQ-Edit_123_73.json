    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the pyramidâ€™s steps transformed into armored segments with consistent thickness, alignment, and geometric integrity, without visible breaks or unnatural warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pyramid's steps maintain a consistent geometric structure, much like the original architecture of the pyramid-known structures. The thickness and alignment of each step are consistent, showing no signs of warping or distortion. This suggests that the transformation maintains the geometric integrity of the steps as would be expected in a real structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the entrance at the top of the pyramid replaced with an eye-like structure that matches the stone material and scale, without abrupt texture changes or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entrance at the top of the pyramid is not replaced by an eye-like structure. Instead, a bright, glowing eye is placed above the pyramid, and it does not match the stone material or scale of the pyramid, clearly appearing as a separate element that floats above.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trees and foliage surrounding the pyramid transform into vine-like scales that follow natural growth patterns and maintain consistent texture and lighting, without unnatural sharp edges or disconnected patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees and foliage maintain a natural appearance with consistent texture and lighting. The foliage retains its natural look rather than transforming into vine-like scales. The environment suggests a natural jungle setting without sharp edges or disconnected patches, retaining realistic growth patterns.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are ancient stone patterns preserved and integrated into the base of the pyramid-creature, maintaining continuity with original carvings and avoiding mismatched or floating decorative elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone base of the pyramid shows a continuation of the ancient stone pyramid design without the addition of mismatched or floating decorative elements. The continuity of the stone patterns is consistent, preserving the original look and maintaining a sense of authenticity with the carved appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the luminescent plants around the base emit soft, localized light that interacts realistically with the environment, without overexposed areas or unnatural color spillage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no luminescent plants emitting light around the base of the pyramid. Instead, the lighting in the image appears natural and consistent with a realistic setting. There are no signs of localized soft light emission, overexposure, or unnatural color spillage in the environment.",
