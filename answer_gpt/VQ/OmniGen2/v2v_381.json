      "question": "Do the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls feature pyramid-inspired designs that are coherent with the original pyramid structure without unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows chibi-style Russian nesting dolls, which do not display pyramid-inspired designs. The dolls have a typical nesting doll appearance with rounded shapes and painted features that are not coherent with the angular, stone-like structure of a pyramid as seen in Image A. Hence, there is no direct design correlation between the dolls and the pyramid structure, leading to the conclusion that they do not feature pyramid-inspired designs.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls arranged in a descending size order on the wooden table without any distortion or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls are displayed in a descending size order, which is a common arrangement for nesting dolls. They appear smooth and proportionate, without any signs of distortion or unnatural scaling. This orderly presentation ensures a harmonious and visually pleasing display, typical of how nesting dolls are usually showcased.",

      "question": "Do the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls retain a natural texture and fine details that resemble the stone texture of the original pyramid without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style Russian nesting dolls in Image B have a glossy, painted texture that is typical for such items, and this texture is quite different from the rough, stone-like texture of the pyramid in Image A. The dolls are smooth and colorful, displaying a finished and polished surface, whereas the pyramid has a rugged, natural stone appearance. Thus, the texture and details on the dolls do not resemble the stone texture of the pyramid.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the transition from the stone pyramid to chibi-style Russian nesting dolls preserve the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the scene without disrupting its visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original scene with a stone pyramid and the edited scene featuring chibi-style Russian nesting dolls are fundamentally different in theme and style. The dolls, while well-arranged, do not naturally transition from the pyramid's material and aesthetic. This change introduces a new visual theme that does not maintain the original authenticity or natural appearance related to the stone pyramid. Therefore, the visual harmony is disrupted by this transition, which deviates from the theme of the pyramid.",

      "question": "Does the sophisticated wooden table complement the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls and fit naturally within the environment of the original image without introducing visual inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden table provides a fitting and appropriate base for displaying the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls. The table's sophisticated look, with neat edges and a polished surface, complements the style of the dolls. However, compared to the pyramid's natural, outdoor setting in Image A, the indoor appearance with the wooden table represents a distinct change in environment. Even though the table and dolls fit well together, they are inconsistent with the outdoor, rugged environment of the original pyramid setting in Image A.",
