    "Question": "Q1: Does the isometric packaging box have consistent edges, proper depth cues, and accurate alignment with the toy figures without visible warping or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a packaging box designed for chibi-style toy figures. The box displays edges and depth cues that suggest it maintains consistent angles and proportions. The accurate alignment with the toy figures inside the box appears to be well-maintained, as there is no visible warping or misalignment in the presentation. This is assessed via the precise alignment of the box's boundaries with the display of the figures and accessories.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the chibi-style figures inside the box proportionally consistent with typical chibi design rules (e.g., large heads, short limbs) and do they retain identifiable features of the original car and robot?",
    "explanation": "The figures inside the box in Image B are designed with the characteristics typical of chibi-style figures, featuring prominently large heads and proportionally short limbs. The figures retain identifiable features such as the color scheme and design elements of the original car and robot—particularly elements like their red and black hues—which are reflective of the chibi adaptation of the original designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the mini tool set, interchangeable helmets, and gear base clearly defined, properly scaled, and positioned without floating or clipping through other elements inside the box?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature tools, helmets, and gear base are presented as separate accessories within the confines of the box. They are well-defined and clearly differentiated from each other. Their positioning seems deliberate and is consistent with spatial organization, ensuring none are floating or clipping through other objects or the packaging itself.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the external surfaces of the car and robot exhibit consistent metallic textures with natural highlights and reflections, without visible artifacts like blotches or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not directly display the original car and robot but shows the chibi figures, which have a clear design with solid colors and contours typical for chibi figures without specific metallic textures or highlights. Thus, the question is not applicable directly to Image B since the figures lack elements directly borrowed from metallic textures or artifacts.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the reflections and lighting on the showcase surface consistent with the direction of light and the materials of the figures, without unnatural glare or shadow mismatches?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a showcase with lighting effects that impact the figures and accessories. The shadows and highlights seem consistent with a central lighting source, properly aligning with the materials and surfaces of the box. There are no visible shadow mismatches or excessive glare, suggesting a natural presentation of light and shadow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
