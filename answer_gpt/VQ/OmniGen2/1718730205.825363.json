      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the leadwork outlines along the spiral vortex continuous, following the curve without gaps, overlaps, or abrupt breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leadwork outlines are observed to be part of a stained glass design. These outlines are crucial for defining areas in stained glass art. Upon examining the spiral vortex, the leadwork appears to follow the natural curve without any visible interruptions, gaps, or overlaps. The craftsmanship seems to maintain continuity which is common in high-quality stained glass works.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the jewel-toned colors applied to the sky and tree canopies transition smoothly without visible color banding or unnatural patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stained glass style that uses jewel-toned colors which are typically vibrant with smooth transitions. The sky and tree canopies show a careful blend of colors. Upon scrutinizing these areas, the transitions appear seamless, without any noticeable banding or blotchy patches, which aligns with the skillful blending used in traditional stained glass artistry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the faceted glass textures applied uniformly across the spiral and trees, showing clear refraction effects without blurring or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire Image B as a stained glass piece uses faceted glass textures to create depth and visual interest. In the spiral and tree areas, the texture appears consistent, with evident refraction effects. Details are preserved well, avoiding any blurring that might suggest poor texture application. The refraction effects add to the dimensionality without loss of clarity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the leadwork lines form clean, unbroken borders around the spiral, trees, and horizon without intersecting incorrectly or creating floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leadwork lines are crucial for the structural integrity of the stained glass design. These lines visibly encase each element (spiral, trees, horizon) precisely. No incorrect intersections or floating segments are present. The lines maintain a coherent and organized layout, indicative of well-considered stained glass artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the individual stars within the spiral and the reflections on the water surface still distinguishable and not obscured by the glass texture or color saturation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a high level of detail synonymous with quality stained glass. The stars within the spiral and the water reflections are clearly visible despite the inherent color saturation and texture of stained glass. The design appears to preserve these individual elements well, ensuring they are distinct and not overshadowed by the artistic style.",
