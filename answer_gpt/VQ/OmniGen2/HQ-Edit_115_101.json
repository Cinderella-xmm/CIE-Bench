      "question": "Does the cylindrical glass body maintain consistent curvature and transparency, with the embossed patterns clearly visible and proportionally scaled across the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass body appears cylindrical and maintains a consistent curvature. The transparency is evident as the liquid inside the bottle is visible. The embossed patterns are clearly discernible, evenly distributed over the bottle's surface without distortion, indicating that they are proportionally scaled. These observations are based on the visual assessment of the bottle's symmetry and detailing.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the label \"Timeless Reserve\" centered within the circular area, with Roman numerals uniformly positioned along its perimeter and matching the font style and size of the original clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label reads 'Timelex Resere', not 'Timeless Reserve', indicating a difference from what's described in the question. However, it is centered within the circular area, and the Roman numerals seem uniformly positioned at the perimeter, resembling the style of a clock face. Thus, the label text does not exactly match 'Timeless Reserve', leading to the shown conclusions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the top ring now resemble a functional bottle cap with a cork stopper that has a natural porous texture, and are the gold accents seamlessly integrated without visible seams or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the top ring as a functional bottle cap with a cork stopper. The cork appears to have a natural porous texture, realistic in its appearance. The gold accents on the bottle neck are smoothly integrated without visible seams or inconsistent lighting, maintaining a cohesive and refined look throughout the bottle.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ornamental scrollwork patterns preserved with full depth and clarity across the curved glass surface, showing no signs of stretching, compression, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental scrollwork patterns on the bottle's surface appear well-preserved, exhibiting full depth and clarity. There are no visible signs of stretching, compression, or pixelation, which can be determined by examining the continuity and definition of the patterns across the curved surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the reflections and shadows on the glass bottle align with the lighting direction of the scene, and are there no visible seams, ghosting, or texture discontinuities at the boundaries between the bottle and the wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflections and shadows appear consistent with the lighting source, as indicated by the highlights and shadows on the glass surface. The boundaries between the glass bottle and the wooden background are smooth, without visible seams, ghosting, or texture discontinuities, maintaining a seamless integration into the scene.",
