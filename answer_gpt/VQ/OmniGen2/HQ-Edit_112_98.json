      "question": "Do the petal-like feathers on the sparrow’s body exhibit smooth transitions in pink gradient without visible pixelation, banding, or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized pink bird with feathers that seamlessly transition in color. The entire bird’s surface maintains a consistent color and smooth gradient, lacking any pixelation or abrupt color changes. This suggests that the artist intended for the colors to smoothly merge, creating a polished and professional appearance. The visual cues from the image indicate careful attention to coloring and feather detailing, which aligns with common artistic practices for high-quality digital illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blossom patterns on the wings aligned with the natural feather structure and do they avoid overlapping or warping of existing feather edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's wings are designed with a crisp, stylized appearance. The wing feathers do not appear to have additional blossom patterns but instead, are constructed in a unified, pink feather pattern typical of a stylized approach. There is no evidence of misalignment or warping. The petals appear orderly and conform to the structure of the wings, demonstrating attention to artistic detail and aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cascading cherry blossom tail emerge naturally from the base of the original tail and follow a downward flow that matches the bird’s posture without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a bird with a tail composed of stylized feathers that naturally extend from where the tail would typically be located. The design maintains a cohesive flow with the rest of the bird’s posture. The blossoms surrounding the tail support the continuity of the design, and there is no evidence of floating or misalignment, indicating a proper integration of the tail into the bird’s design. This harmony is often seen in illustrations intended to have a strong visual impact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the vines around the sparrow’s legs follow natural curvature and thickness proportional to the leg size, without penetrating or distorting the foot structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the legs does not include vines. Instead, the feet of the bird are positioned on a branch. The foot structure and the branch interaction are consistent, where the branch supports rather than distorts or penetrates the foot structure. The detail in the branch with blossoms versus vines suggest attention was focused on maintaining the integrity and aesthetics of the bird's pose and surrounding tree elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dewdrop ornaments on the chest positioned realistically on the surface of the feathers and do they reflect light consistently with surrounding lighting conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image does not feature dewdrop ornaments on the chest of the bird. The bird exhibits a smooth, singular color without additional adornments, focusing on the pink feather aesthetic. The lighting present is harmonious with the overall glow effect around the bird, reflecting pastel color themes typically used in such stylized imagery. Without dewdrop elements, the composition relies on other visual cues to convey softness and illumination.",
