      "question": "Do the pastries in the edited image maintain their original shapes without distorted or stretched forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries appear to be heavily stylized and lack the realistic shapes seen in Image A, which showcased a more organic appearance typical of baked goods. In Image B, the pastries have a more simplified form with exaggerated ridges and curves, indicating that the shapes have been altered. Therefore, the shapes in Image B do not maintain their realistic form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bread slices' internal textures clearly visible and consistent with real bread, or do they appear overly stylized with uniform patterns that lack natural variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the internal textures of bread are depicted with stylized and uniform patterns. The details, which would indicate crumbs or the porous texture typical of bread, are absent, replaced by a smooth, unrealistic surface. This lack of natural variation suggests an artistic interpretation rather than an accurate representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the muffin liners show clear geometric patterns that still align with the shape of the muffins and do not float or detach from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of muffin liners and their geometric patterns are not aligned or even visible as individual elements compared to the distinct muffin liners visible in Image A. The muffins in Image B are simplistically drawn without details like liners, leading to the conclusion that their presence is either abstracted or omitted.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the checkerboard pattern applied uniformly across the tray surfaces without breaking the perceived depth or causing unnatural flatness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clear application of a checkerboard pattern over any tray surfaces as they do not maintain detailed realism. Instead, the shapes are more abstract and colorful without mimicking the discernible patterns found in realistic textures, suggesting a stylized approach without true depth reference.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the abstract shapes in the background positioned in a way that matches the depth and alignment of the original cup stack, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the abstract shapes are vividly colored and are placed in a manner that does not correspond with any objects from Image A. They do not reference the depth and alignment of the cup stack from Image A, but rather exist independently in a two-dimensional style, suggesting a focus on artistic arrangement without shared alignment.",
