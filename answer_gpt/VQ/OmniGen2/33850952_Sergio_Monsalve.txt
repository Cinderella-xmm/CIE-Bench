    "Question": "Q1: Are the tentacle-like extensions smoothly integrated into the original curves of the facade without sudden angular breaks or disconnected segments?",
    "explanation": "The tentacle-like extensions in Image B are part of a fantastical jellyfish-like structure with curves and elements entirely different from the architectural form seen in Image A. In the edited image, the extensions are smoothly part of the overall design without angular breaks, disconnected segments, or elements visibly contradicting the structure's visual continuity. The integration seems purposeful and aligned with a cohesive alien design rather than architectural integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the fibrous textures follow the curvature of the facade and appear continuous without repeating patterns or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fibrous textures are part of a tentacular alien design structure. The textures are seamlessly integrated into the curves, hugging the tentacle structures without obvious repeating patterns or jagged edges. The design maintains the flow and continuity expected in organic or sci-fi design elements, contrasting the straight lines and materials of Image A's architectural facade.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the window areas replaced with translucent membranes that maintain soft light transmission and lack sharp borders or visible seams?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a jellyfish-like dome structure that does not display window areas at all. Instead, the translucent surface appears naturally integrated without sharp borders or visible seams. This is consistent with its organic, alien design, as opposed to the structured windows in Image A's facade.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the iridescent scale patterns align with the surface curvature and display smooth color transitions without flat or distorted regions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the iridescent scale patterns cover the dome and are smoothly integrated with its curvature. The colors transition evenly, providing a consistent iridescent glow without flat or distorted regions, unlike the flat, metallic facade of the building in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the bio-luminescent lines emit a soft, uneven glow that fades naturally at the edges and interacts with nearby surfaces?",
    "explanation": "The bio-luminescent lines in Image B are part of a glowing ring around the base of the jellyfish-like structure. The glow is soft and fades at the edges, complementing the environment by interacting with nearby surfaces naturally and without harsh interruptions, differing from any architectural lighting in Image A, which doesn't have the same ambient, soft glowing effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all modified elements—tentacles, membranes, textures, and glow lines—properly anchored to the building structure without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fantastical elements such as tentacles, membranes, and glow lines are integral parts of the alien structure, well-anchored and not overlapping incorrectly as they are designed to be part of a unified fantastical concept. This differs from Image A's structured architectural design without such elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are balcony railings, interior furniture, and planters still visible and undistorted beneath the added textures and lighting effects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, balcony railings, interior furniture, and planters are not apparent or visible because the image represents a different, alien-themed concept entirely replacing the original architectural elements found in Image A. Therefore, these elements are not present or distorted beneath added textures or lighting effects.",
    "answer": "No"
