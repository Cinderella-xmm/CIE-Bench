      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the velvet lining inside the box display a soft, matte texture with subtle pile variation and appropriate shadowing beneath the key, indicating realistic fabric behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the velvet lining inside the box exhibits characteristics typical of high-quality fabric. The texture appears soft and matte with subtle variations in pile that contribute to a realistic appearance. This is enhanced by appropriate shadowing beneath the key, adding depth and indicating that the key is resting naturally on the surface. The analysis uses visual cues such as texture and shadow consistency to infer realistic fabric behavior.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gold scrollwork patterns on the lid continuous, symmetrical, and proportionally similar to the decorative elements on the key’s bow, without any jagged edges or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scrollwork patterns on the lid are continuous and symmetrical. They have a proportional similarity to the decorative elements on the key's bow. Visual inspection reveals that these patterns are well-defined, without jagged edges or missing segments. This conclusion is drawn from observing the regularity and harmony of the patterns, reflecting a high level of craftsmanship similar to the key’s intricate design.",

      "question": "Is the satin compartment visibly smooth with soft highlights and gentle folds, and does the key sit flush within it without gaps or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The satin compartment in Image B is visibly smooth, showcasing soft highlights and gentle folds, which are typical characteristics of satin fabric. The key appears to sit flush within this compartment, with no visible gaps or indication that it is floating above the surface. This observation is based on the consistent interaction between the key and the fabric, seen through appropriate draping and shadow patterns.",

      "question": "Is the embossed text “Eternal Elegance” clearly legible, evenly raised, and rendered with a metallic luster that matches the gold tone and reflectivity of the key and scrollwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The embossed text in Image B is clear and legible, demonstrating an evenly raised appearance. It possesses a metallic luster that matches the gold tone and reflectivity of the key and the scrollwork patterns. This is identified by the consistent shine and color across the text and the ornamental elements, ensuring a cohesive and elegant presentation.",

      "question": "Are all ornamental details of the key — including the bow’s loops, bead-like protrusions, and shaft ridges — fully preserved and sharply defined without blurring, warping, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental details of the key are fully preserved and exhibit sharp definition. The bow’s loops, bead-like protrusions, and shaft ridges are clear, and there is no evidence of blurring, warping, or pixelation. This careful preservation of detail is determined by examining the crispness and clarity of the features, which indicates high image quality and attention to detail in design and rendering.",
