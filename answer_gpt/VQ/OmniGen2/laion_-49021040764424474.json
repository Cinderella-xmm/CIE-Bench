    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the orange, black, and silver sections of the truck's body composed of clearly defined LEGO brick patterns with uniform size and alignment, avoiding blurred or inconsistent textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is constructed using LEGO bricks, evident from the iconic stud patterns and uniform brick size. The sections are composed of orange, black, and silver bricks that are aligned well, showcasing the typical LEGO construction style with no blurred textures, providing a detailed and consistent appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wheels consist of circular gray LEGO-style pieces with correct proportions and no deformation, maintaining a solid geometric structure without jagged edges or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheels in Image B are represented by LEGO pieces, which are circular gray with a defined LEGO-like pattern. The wheels are well-proportioned, smoothly circular, and exhibit the structured appearance typical of LEGO without any visual deformation, ensuring solid geometry without jagged edges.",

      "question": "Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth, flat black LEGO tiles arranged in a regular grid pattern without gaps, overlaps, or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the truck bed covered with black LEGO tiles that follow a regular grid pattern. The tiles are arranged smoothly, covering the bed evenly without visible gaps or misalignments, which is consistent with the typical LEGO building style ensuring uniformity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO truck positioned securely on a flat white shelf with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does the shelf extend appropriately beneath the full width of the truck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO truck is placed on a flat white shelf designed to provide a solid base with no floating effects. The shelf extends adequately beneath the truck, supporting its entirety and ensuring it is securely positioned without any visible gaps, confirming its stability.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all major structural components such as the tailgate, side steps, and bumpers correctly reconstructed in LEGO form with accurate proportions and proper alignment to the rest of the truck body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO truck where structural components like the tailgate, side steps, and bumpers are recreated using LEGO bricks. These components appear proportionate and are accurately aligned with the rest of the truck body, maintaining the characteristic LEGO style while ensuring coherent construction and alignment.",
