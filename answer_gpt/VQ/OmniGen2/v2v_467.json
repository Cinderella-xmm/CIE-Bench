      "question": "Does the 3D chibi cat maintain the natural shape and proportions of its ears and eyes without any visible distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi cat is designed with a stylized appearance, characteristic of chibi designs, which often feature exaggerated or more simplified features compared to realistic depictions. The ears are slightly larger and more rounded, and the eyes are significantly larger, giving it a cartoonish charm. While these proportions do not mimic natural cat anatomy, they are intentional for chibi style and not considered distortions in this context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fur texture and other fine details of the cat accurately represented in the 3D chibi character without any loss or unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D chibi character in Image B lacks detailed fur texture which is typical for chibi representations where the focus is on simplicity and smooth surfaces for a cute appearance. The design prioritizes the toy-like smoothness over realistic fur detail, which aligns with the expectations for this kind of style.",

      "question": "Do the bold linework and delicate textures on the cereal box design accurately reflect the cat's fur and eyes without any inconsistencies or unnatural appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the cereal box design in Image B, the cat illustration adopts a bold, graphic style that does not attempt to replicate the detailed texture of real cat fur, focusing instead on a clean, recognizable iconography suitable for branding. This type of design is common for product packaging and does not aim for realism.",

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is positioned next to the cereal box on a kitchen counter, and the surrounding kitchen elements are naturally integrated into the scene. The spatial arrangement and perspective are consistent, creating a coherent and plausible scene. The design ensures all elements interact properly within the space.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition in Image B integrates clean design and a well-lit, elegant kitchen setting, enhancing the premium feel of the product. The playful element is introduced through the chibi character design and the creative presentation on the cereal box. The blend of minimalism, clarity in design, and the stylized cat character contributes to a coherent and upscale brand identity.",
