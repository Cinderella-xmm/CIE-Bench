    "Question": "Q1: Are the iridescent wings attached to the spider’s thorax symmetrically and do they display smooth, continuous mosaic-like patterns without jagged edges or texture breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spider's wings exhibit a symmetrical attachment to the thorax which can be observed through their equal placement on either side of the body. The wings display mosaic-like patterns characterized by colorful segments fitting together smoothly without any jagged edges or breaks in texture. Considering common design principles like symmetry and pattern continuity, the wings fulfill these criteria.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the luminous orb positioned where the original abdomen was, and does it maintain proportional size and alignment with the spider’s body without appearing detached or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B shows that a luminous orb is placed in the position where a spider’s abdomen typically rests. The orb is proportionate in relation to the spider’s body, neither too large nor small, and it aligns well, not appearing detached or misaligned. The smooth transition from thorax to orb supports its integration with the spider’s anatomy based on typical spider body proportions and structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the golden filigree spirals wrap around each leg segment smoothly, following the natural bends and joints without breaking or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the spider with leg decorations in the form of golden filigree spirals. These are wrapped smoothly around each leg segment, following the natural bends and joints without any apparent breaking or incorrect overlapping. This wrapping technique is consistent with the natural articulation of spider legs, lending an orderly and well-executed appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the fangs now thin, translucent, and needle-shaped, extending naturally from the spider’s mouth area without appearing misshapen or disconnected?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spider’s fangs appear thin, translucent, and needle-like, emanating naturally from the mouth area. They maintain an organic shape and do not seem misshaped or disconnected from the mouth, fitting the general anatomical structure observed in arachnids. Such characteristics align well with practical fantastical imagery.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the ethereal aura surround the spider uniformly, fading gently into the background without visible streaks, sharp edges, or interference with nearby leaves or web strands?",
    "explanation": "Image B features an ethereal aura enveloping the spider, which fades smoothly into the background. It shows a uniform distribution around the spider without sharp streaks or edges, and it doesn’t interfere visually with nearby leaves or web strands. The seamless integration suggests a controlled and artistic use of aura effects adding to the fantasy element.",
    "answer": "Yes"
