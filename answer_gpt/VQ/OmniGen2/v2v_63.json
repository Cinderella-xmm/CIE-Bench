      "question": "Do the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls accurately reflect the individual's attire and stance without introducing unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style Russian nesting dolls in Image B reflect the individual's attire by mimicking the color scheme of the clothes—red and blue—which is consistent with the outfit in Image A. The stance is simplified into a typical chibi-style pose, and there are no visible distortions or broken geometric shapes as the structure of the dolls follows the traditional nesting doll shape. This shape is known for its smooth curves and clean lines, which are present here.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to maintain an aspect ratio that closely resembles the 3:2 standard often used in photography, which is known for creating visually balanced and coherent compositions. The proportions between the width and height give a sense of a well-composed frame that does not feel unnaturally stretched or compressed, suggesting adherence to this aspect ratio.",
