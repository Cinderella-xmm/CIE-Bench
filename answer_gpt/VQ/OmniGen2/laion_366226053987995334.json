    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) on the feather earrings proportionally sized and seamlessly integrated into the feather surface without distorting the engraved lines or creating unnatural texture contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features (eyes and smile) are added to the central area where there was originally a black oval stone. The design keeps the original central oval shape intact without disrupting the harmony between the new features and the feather's engraved lines. The added face blends into the existing design without any distortion, maintaining a natural look with no texture contrast issues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central black oval stone on each feather preserved and unobscured by the added facial features, and do the engraved lines of the feather remain symmetrical and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the central black oval area, previously occupied by a stone in Image A, now features facial elements, yet the oval shape and its placement remain consistent. The facial features are composed within this area, leaving the feather's engraved lines surrounding it undistorted and symmetrical, preserving the overall design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a visible and logically connected arm-like extension from one earring to the other, suggesting motion, and are both earrings still properly attached to their hooks without floating or detachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anthropomorphized earrings have arm-like extensions drawn, which suggest interaction and motion, adding a lively aspect to the visual. These arms are positioned logically relative to the earrings, enhancing their animated character. Despite these additions, the earrings remain securely attached to their hooks, appearing neither detached nor floating, which ensures they maintain their proper context as wearable items.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text bubble positioned near the head of the anthropomorphic earring, clearly legible, and free from overlapping or covering essential details of the earrings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text bubble is strategically placed near the earrings' head area, perfectly complementing the anthropomorphic theme. It does not overlap or obscure any part of the earrings, ensuring the facial features and overall design are fully visible. The text is clearly legible, maintaining the image's intended narrative without interference.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bold outlines follow the exact contours of the earrings without gaps or misalignment, and are the vibrant colors applied consistently without pixelation, blurring, or loss of fine engraved details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the earrings with bold outlines that accurately trace the contours of the earrings, preserving the intricate feather design without misalignment or gaps. The color application is vibrant and evenly spread across the image, avoiding pixelation or blurring. The fine engraved details of the feather remain intact, which ensures a visually appealing and cohesive cartoon-style presentation.",
