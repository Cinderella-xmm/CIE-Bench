    "Question": "Q1: Are the animal characters positioned directly over the original locations of the process boxes without shifting or overlapping neighboring elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each animal character corresponds to positions that seemingly replace the process boxes in Image A. For instance, the fox aligns with 'Data Mining', the owl with 'Business Understanding', and the deer with 'Deployment'. They do not visibly overlap with neighboring elements, suggesting deliberate placement akin to the original process boxes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the playful paths between characters form a continuous, unbroken winding route that follows the circular structure of the original diagram without abrupt turns or gaps?",
    "explanation": "The animal characters in Image B are connected by winding paths that mimic the circular flow of the original diagram in Image A. These paths appear to create a coherent circular structure guiding the viewer's eye through the 'data journey', thereby maintaining a continuous flow without noticeable abrupt turns or gaps.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the central cluster of glowing data crystals positioned at the center of the diagram and scaled appropriately so it does not dominate or shrink the surrounding characters?",
    "explanation": "In the center of Image B, a cluster of glowing data crystals replaces the data cylinder from Image A. It is centrally located, forming the focal point without dominating or encroaching upon the surrounding animal characters, which still have sufficient space.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the speech bubbles placed near each character without overlapping them or other elements, and do they contain legible text that is consistent in font and size?",
    "explanation": "Each animal character in Image B has a speech bubble placed nearby. They are strategically positioned to avoid overlap with the characters or other elements. The legibility of the text is consistent in font and size across these bubbles, ensuring coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the animal characters display realistic limb positions and interactions with props (e.g., magnifying glass, laptop, clipboard) that conform to known anatomy and ergonomics?",
    "explanation": "The animal characters in Image B interact with various props like magnifying glasses, laptops, and clipboards. Their limb positioning and the manner in which they hold these objects are illustratively realistic, allowing viewers to recognize these interactions as intuitive despite their whimsical nature.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all elements (characters, paths, background, text) rendered with consistent line art, shading, and color saturation, avoiding mismatched textures or sudden changes in style?",
    "explanation": "Image B exhibits consistent artistic elements throughout. The line art, shading, and color saturation across characters, paths, background, and text are uniform, avoiding any jarring mismatch in style, texture, or color.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Is the title banner located at the top edge of the image, fully visible, and not overlapping any part of the diagram or characters?",
    "explanation": "The title banner in Image B is clearly situated at the top edge. It appears fully visible without overlapping any other part of the diagram or characters, ensuring clear readability and maintaining the design's integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
