    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed teapot maintain a uniform cylindrical shape with smooth, continuous surfaces and no visible geometric distortions or irregularities?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object of focus is a cylindrical golden container, not a teapot as in Image A. The container has smooth, continuous surfaces typical of cylindrical shapes, and there are no visible geometric distortions or irregularities. The sides, top, and bottom are uniform and symmetrical, which is consistent with the characteristics of a cylindrical shape.",

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the bamboo motif along the side have consistent node spacing, natural grain texture, and smooth edges without repeating or distorted segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bamboo motif along the side of the container exhibits consistent node spacing and smooth edges, giving it a more realistic appearance. The grain texture appears natural, and there are no visible repeating or distorted segments, indicating attention to detail in the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the surface beneath the tea set completely flat, uniformly white, and free from any unintended shadows, textures, or reflections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the golden container is uniformly white and appears completely flat. There are no unintended shadows, textures, or reflections, suggesting a perfect isolation of the object against the white background for a clean presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
