      "question": "Does the glass dome enclosing the pocket watch and fabric exhibit clear, smooth transparency with realistic light refraction and reflection, without visible distortion or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome is enclosing the pocket watch and other items, and can be seen with realistic light refraction and reflections. The glass appears smooth and free from jagged edges, showing a smooth transparency with no noticeable distortion of what is inside the dome. This indicates that it has been edited to reflect realistic glass properties by visually allowing the objects inside to be clearly seen through it.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the miniature leather-bound books and quill placed around the watch at a consistent scale relative to the pocket watch and fabric, and do they rest naturally on the surface without appearing suspended or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature leather-bound books and quill are arranged around the pocket watch. They are at a consistent scale, complementing the size of the pocket watch and fabric, and appear to be resting naturally on the surface. There are no visual cues suggesting suspension or distortion, indicating proper attention to perspective and scale in the editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the leather-bound books display earthy and vibrant colors (such as deep browns, ochres, or burgundies) that harmonize with the original fabric tone, and is the golden embroidery on the fabric continuous, finely detailed, and free of artificial shine or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leather-bound books exhibit earthy tones like burgundies, which harmonize with the original maroon fabric. The golden embroidery on the fabric appears continuous and finely detailed, without any artificial shine or broken lines, suggesting attention to color and detail in the editing process. The colors and details are coherent with the craft and style of antique or vintage objects, aligning with the aesthetic suggested by the pocket watch.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pocket watch preserved with intact geometric form, visible engraved patterns, and consistent metallic reflections, showing no deformation or loss of fine detail due to integration into the new scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pocket watch maintains its geometric form with visible engraved patterns. The metallic reflections appear consistent, suggesting that the fine details have been preserved well in the editing process. There is no evidence of deformation or loss of detail when integrated into the new scene, indicating careful preservation of the original object's visual properties.",

      "question": "Is the texture of the maroon fabric with red and gold embroidery consistently sharp and unbroken throughout, including under and around the glass dome, with no blurred areas, repeating patterns, or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
