    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) on the feather earrings proportionally sized and seamlessly integrated into the feather surface without distorting the engraved lines or creating unnatural texture contrasts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features (eyes and smile) are added to the central area where there was originally a black oval stone. The design keeps the original central oval shape intact without disrupting the harmony between the new features and the feather's engraved lines.
