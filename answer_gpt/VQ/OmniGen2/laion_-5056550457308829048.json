      "question": "Does the basketball motif on Patrick’s shirt appear seamlessly integrated with the fabric texture, without visible seams, jagged edges, or unnatural color blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Patrick is absent, so there is no analysis possible for the basketball motif on Patrick's shirt. As such, there are no seams, jagged edges, or color blending issues to assess. Therefore, the question cannot be correctly answered with the given Image B.",

      "question": "Are SpongeBob’s sneakers proportionally accurate and do they feature a clear, consistent cereal loop pattern without distortion or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, SpongeBob and his doppelganger appear wearing sneakers that, when viewed, do not directly relate to a cereal loop pattern but are part of a sports theme with accurate proportions. The cereal is depicted at their feet, not on their sneakers, hence, there should be no distortion or sheen issues associated with a cereal loop pattern on the sneakers themselves.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cereal hoops surrounding the characters have consistent circular shapes, appropriate size relative to the figures, and realistic lighting and shadowing that match the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cereal hoops are directly under the SpongeBob characters and display consistent circular shapes and appear to be piled in a manner that suggests some realistic depth. The size of the cereal relative to the characters looks appropriate, and there's an attempt at shadowing at the base which complements the cereal's appearance in the scene's lighting conditions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the urban sports background with graffiti elements stylistically consistent with the characters and free from obvious texture mismatches, such as sharp edges, incorrect lighting, or unnatural surface details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an urban backdrop with basketball themes and a hint of graffiti art style. The elements shown match well with SpongeBob and fit the energetic and colorful narrative, avoiding any jarring mismatches or lighting issues between the subjects and their background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title “Basketball Breakfast Blitz!” clearly readable, properly aligned at the top of the image, and free from blurring, shadow artifacts, or overlapping with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'Basketball Breakfast Blitz!' is prominently placed at the top of the cereal box. The typography is bold and cartoonish, aligning well with the overall design. It does not overlap with other elements and is free from blurring or shadows, maintaining clear readability.",
