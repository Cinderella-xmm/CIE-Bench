    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the LEGO blocks forming the bookshelf and books have a uniform, smooth plastic texture throughout, with no residual wood grain or mixed material appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bookshelf features blocks that exhibit a smooth plastic texture consistent with LEGO materials, without any visible residue of wood grain or mixed material appearances. This consistency suggests a material transformation from wood to plastic. Through observation of the LEGO structure, the texture seems uniform across the entire structure, aligning with the typical plastic finish of LEGO blocks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the LEGO blocks uniformly earthy-toned (e.g., browns, tans, dark reds) and consistent with the original bookshelf’s color scheme, without any unexpected or jarring color deviations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO blocks are primarily composed of earthy tones such as browns and tans, which mimic the color scheme of classic wooden bookshelves. No sudden or striking color variations are present that would disrupt the overall aesthetic continuity. This choice of color helps maintain a visual connection to traditional materials, supporting a harmonious transformation from the original image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the darker LEGO bricks used for carvings clearly aligned and shaped to replicate the original decorative patterns on the spines and shelf edges without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the darker LEGO bricks are used strategically to imitate the intricate carvings visible on the original bookshelf’s edges and book spines. These replicated patterns are recognizable and align well with the original design, demonstrating precise alignment and clear shaping. This suggests effective use of dark LEGO bricks to reproduce the decorative features without causing blurriness or misalignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the top of the LEGO tower taper smoothly and symmetrically from the base upward, without jagged edges, irregular steps, or disproportionate narrowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observation of Image B shows that the LEGO tower’s top tapers upward symmetrically from the base, maintaining a consistent profile. The tapering is achieved without abrupt transitions or uneven edges, thereby offering a visually coherent and smooth ascension. The structure's narrowing remains proportional, demonstrating careful construction.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background behind the LEGO tower completely plain and muted, with no traces of the original textured wallpaper or lighting artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is plain and possesses a muted, neutral color with no evidence of the textured wallpaper seen in Image A. Additionally, there are no visible lighting artifacts that could disrupt the plainness of the background. This suggests a clean and simple backdrop tailored to highlight the LEGO structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all LEGO blocks aligned perfectly in rows and columns, with no gaps, overlaps, or floating pieces that disrupt the modular structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The examination of Image B reveals that the LEGO blocks are meticulously aligned in orderly rows and columns, characteristic of LEGO construction. There are no visible gaps, overlaps, or elements that appear out of place, affirming the modular integrity and precision typical in LEGO configurations.",
