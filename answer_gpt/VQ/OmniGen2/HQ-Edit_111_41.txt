    "Question": "Q1: Are the seat cushion's surfaces composed of clearly defined, uniformly sized LEGO brick layers with smooth gradients between them, maintaining a consistent black color without texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the seat cushion appears to be made of smooth black material, and there are clear horizontal lines suggesting separation, but there are no visible signs of LEGO brick layers such as studs or interlocking features. World knowledge of LEGO bricks would indicate these features should be present if they were used, but they aren't visible here. Therefore, the cushion does not match the specific LEGO brick layer description.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the backrest consist of evenly spaced, horizontally aligned LEGO brick layers that follow the original contour without gaps, misalignments, or irregular spacing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the backrest is composed of distinct horizontal lines, appearing uniform and evenly spaced. However, visual inspection shows no signs of LEGO brick characteristics such as studs or interlocking parts. Combining this visual information with world knowledge about LEGO bricks, the backrest doesn't have the specific LEGO features mentioned in the question.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the armrests rendered as simple hinged LEGO pieces with clean edges and uniform silver finish, preserving their original curvature and connection points without distortion?",
    "explanation": "Image B's armrests appear straight rather than rounded or curved, with a metallic silver color. World knowledge of LEGO pieces suggests they have visible hinges or connectors, which the current armrests lack, meaning they are not explicitly LEGO-style hinged pieces in their current form.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are all five wheels made of translucent gray material with visible internal structure resembling LEGO wheel design, and do they maintain consistent size and placement under the base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels are black with a solid appearance and lack translucency or the internal structure typical of LEGO wheels. World knowledge indicates that LEGO wheels often showcase a defined structural design with circular holes or grooves, absent here. Furthermore, the wheels align correctly under the base, but their material and design do not match the LEGO style described.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the chair positioned on a flat, uninterrupted white tabletop surface that contrasts with the original floor, with no visible shadows or depth inconsistencies suggesting misalignment?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the chair on an entirely flat, white surface that does contrast with the original floor in Image A, which appears more textured and darker. The surface has no visible shadows or depth changes, indicating a seamless tabletop with no alignment issues. This matches the described setup in the question.",
    "answer": "Yes"
