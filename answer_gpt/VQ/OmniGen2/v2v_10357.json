      "question": "Are the shapes of the teddy bear and motorcycle still recognizable after being converted to a low-poly 3-D render style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear and motorcycle are rendered in a low-poly 3-D style, which simplifies the shapes into geometric forms. Despite this simplification, the overall shapes and distinctive features of both the teddy bear and motorcycle remain identifiable. The teddy bear retains its recognizable rounded form, ears, and limbs, and the motorcycle maintains its characteristic structure, including the handlebars, wheels, and engine. This ability to recognize the objects despite the stylistic change demonstrates the effectiveness of the low-poly technique in maintaining recognizable shapes.",

      "question": "Do the surfaces of the teddy bear and motorcycle retain their texture details without appearing overly simplified or losing important features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the low-poly 3-D render style, the surfaces of both the teddy bear and motorcycle appear simplified with flat, geometric planes. This minimalist approach means that texture details are reduced or absent, in favor of a stylized aesthetic that focuses on shape and form rather than surface texture. For instance, the teddy bear's fur and the motorcycle's metallic finish from the original image are not present, indicating that detailed textures have been simplified in this transformation.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the teddy bear and motorcycle consistent with their real-world counterparts, avoiding any distortion or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the teddy bear relative to the motorcycle appear consistent with what one would expect in a real-world scenario. The motorcycle appears correctly scaled in relation to the teddy bear, allowing the bear to sit appropriately on the seat with its limbs positioned naturally on the handlebars. This suggests that despite the change in style, the proportions have been carefully maintained to avoid unrealistic distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the teddy bear appear naturally seated on the motorcycle, maintaining a believable posture and interaction with the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear is positioned on the motorcycle similarly to Image A, with its legs astride the seat and hands on the handlebars. This posture is commonly associated with riding a motorcycle, and it looks believable and natural given the interaction depicted. The simplification due to low-poly style does not hinder the depiction of a credible interaction between the bear and the motorcycle.",

      "question": "Is the scenic background seamlessly integrated with the low-poly 3-D rendered teddy bear and motorcycle, without any visible artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background remains a realistic depiction similar to Image A, featuring a recognizable landmark and scenery. While the foreground (bear and motorcycle) has been converted into a low-poly render, the background remains photorealistic. Despite this stylistic contrast, the scene as a whole does not exhibit visible artifacts or mismatches; however, the difference in styles can be visually jarring. Nonetheless, the elements do not appear to clash, preserving a cohesive and consistent look across the image.",
