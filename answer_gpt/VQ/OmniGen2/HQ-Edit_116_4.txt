    "Question": "Q1: Are the transformed lanterns now depicted as balloons with consistent spherical shapes, smooth surfaces, and realistic lighting effects that match their surrounding environment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lanterns are replaced by balloons with spherical shapes and smooth surfaces. The lighting reflects off these balloons naturally, suggesting a detailed rendering of light effects, which is consistent with their environment. The symmetry and lighting effects show professional editing in line with common knowledge of balloon design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the exaggerated patterns on the kimono display continuous, flowing designs with consistent texture and color gradients that resemble real fabric without visible digital artifacts or breaks in pattern continuity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the kimono maintain a continuous flow with consistent textures and color gradients. They resemble real fabric due to the careful editing and lack of digital artifacts, demonstrating a seamless transition and pattern continuity. This result is visible through a uniform representation that mimics authentic fabric design.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the girlâ€™s face retain anatomically plausible proportions, including correctly shaped eyes, nose, and mouth, with no signs of stretching, misalignment, or incorrect number of fingers on her hands?",
    "explanation": "Image B has the face blurred, thus the facial features and hand details are obscured, making it impossible to assess the anatomical plausibility of the features or rely on conventional descriptors. Therefore, an analysis of this question is not applicable without visible features.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the detachable message section at the bottom of the image aligned properly with the card layout, featuring clean borders and consistent shading that matches the overall lighting of the scene?",
    "explanation": "The bottom section of Image B, designed to look detachable, aligns well with the card layout. The borders are clean and the shading consistent, matching the overall lighting of the image. This indicates an understanding of layout design principles and attention to detail, ensuring the detachable feature integrates seamlessly with the overall image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the title texts rendered in a bold, traditional-style font with clear strokes, proper spacing, and no visible aliasing or distortion that would suggest poor integration into the image?",
    "explanation": "The texts in Image B are rendered in a bold, traditional-style font, featuring clear strokes and appropriate spacing. There is no visibility of aliasing or distortion that would stand out, implying that the texts are well-integrated and display high-quality typographic execution, consistent with professional image editing standards.",
    "answer": "Yes"
