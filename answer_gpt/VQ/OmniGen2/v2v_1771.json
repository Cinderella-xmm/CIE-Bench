      "question": "Does the snowy tundra landscape appear naturally integrated with the Leaning Tower of Pisa without any visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Leaning Tower of Pisa is placed against a snowy tundra landscape. Observing the image, there are no visible seams or unnatural edges indicating a poor integration or editing around the Tower and the snowy background. The lighting on the Tower is consistent with the lighting of a sunrise or sunset, which fits naturally with the color and context of the snowy backdrop. This suggests an integration that appears natural without abrupt transitions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the snowy tundra landscape consistent with the natural appearance of the original image, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowy tundra in Image B appears to have a consistent texture and color typical of snow-covered landscapes. The smooth, undisturbed snow and the slight variations in color due to lighting match well with what would be expected in a real-world snowy scene. There are no visible artifacts or unnatural distortions that would suggest poor editing or an artificial appearance.",

      "question": "Does the Leaning Tower of Pisa maintain its structural coherence and proportions against the new snowy tundra background, without any distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Leaning Tower of Pisa retains its recognizable shape and structure, with no visible distortions or broken geometric lines. The architectural elements, such as the columns and arches, are intact and proportionally consistent with the real structure, ensuring that it remains coherent against the snowy tundra background.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine architectural details of the Leaning Tower of Pisa been preserved, and does the snowy tundra background lack any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fine architectural details of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, such as the carvings and column patterns, appear to be preserved in Image B. The clarity of the details suggests minimal loss in quality or detail through the editing process. Additionally, the background, which consists of a snowy tundra, lacks any unnatural textures or areas where detail might be expected but absent. Thus, both the Tower and the background appear detailed and natural.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the elements of the snowy tundra landscape, such as snow-covered ground and trees, appear physically plausible and proportionate relative to the size of the Leaning Tower of Pisa?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowy tundra landscape surrounding the Leaning Tower of Pisa consists mainly of snow-covered ground without visible trees, making it difficult to directly assess tree proportion. However, the snow-covered ground appears continuous and appropriately scaled relative to the Tower. The lack of trees in the immediate vicinity of the Tower avoids proportion conflicts and maintains plausibility in the scene.",
