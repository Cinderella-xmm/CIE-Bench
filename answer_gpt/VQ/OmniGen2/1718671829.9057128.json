      "question": "Are the wooden beams and roof supports rendered as consistent geometric shapes with sharp, clean edges and no warped or fractured sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rendering of the wooden beams and roof supports does not depict physical wooden textures or grain. Instead, it uses stylized geometric shapes with clean, sharp lines typical of a design or pattern. The consistent geometric appearance suggests no warped or fractured sections, aligning with the precision of geometric shapes. Image A depicts actual wooden beams with natural texture. Comparison indicates Image B has a more stylized representation compared to the natural appearance in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the moon a perfectly round shape with a smooth surface and uniform glow around its edge, without jagged outlines or uneven brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the moon as a stylized representation, reflecting a perfectly round shape with uniform brightness and smooth edges, as typical of geometric and illustrative design styles. Image A shows the moon with natural features like some surface variation typical of photographic representation. The stylized nature of Image B allows for a more consistent geometric perfection compared to the organic appearance of the moon in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the plants in the foreground and background arranged in symmetrical, repeating patterns without irregular spacing or fragmented shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plants are represented with symmetrical and repeating patterns, evident through the stylized design reflecting consistent shapes and spacing. This contrasts with Image A, where plants are depicted naturally with irregular spacing and shapes characteristic of organic growth. The design choice in Image B reflects a pattern-oriented interpretation instead of the natural depiction seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Do the wooden surfaces and glass panes display metallic gold and silver accents with consistent sheen and reflection, without color bleeding or missing texture details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the wooden surfaces and glass panes using flat colors and outlines typical of stylized art, resembling metallic gold hues rather than actual wood textures. The consistent sheen and color representation suggest no texture detail or color bleeding issues. Image A illustrates real wooden surfaces and glass with natural textures. The artistic style in Image B emphasizes design elements rather than realistic textures, differing from Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the stylized clouds positioned above the horizon with smooth, flowing outlines and do the window frames show bold, angular lines that align with the architectural style without breaking the windowâ€™s structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains stylized clouds above the horizon characterized by smooth, flowing outlines fitting an illustrative style. The window frames in Image B are drawn with bold lines that enhance the geometric and angular architectural representation, fitting coherently with the design without affecting structural integrity. Unlike Image A, which shows realistic depictions of clouds and window frames, Image B takes a stylized approach that maintains the integrity of the depicted architecture.",
