      "question": "Does the 3D chibi rendition of the dancer maintain natural proportions without introducing any unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing image B involves examining the dancer's proportions such as limb lengths, body width, and symmetry. The dancer appears to maintain realistic proportions, with limbs and torso sizes consistent with human anatomy. No visible geometric distortions or exaggerated features are detected, indicating that the 3D chibi rendition is accurate in maintaining natural proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glowing elliptical portal visually credible, with no obvious artifacts where it meets the realistic dance studio environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The portal in image B is assessed for integration with the environment and any inconsistencies or artifacts. The glow is smooth, and its elliptical shape appears consistent throughout, without obvious breaks or pixelation where it intersects with the studio background. This suggests that the portal is plausibly integrated into the setting without visual artifacts.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dancer's hand extending towards the viewer retain natural textures and details, with no more than five fingers visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the dancer's hand is inspected for finger count and texture. The hand extends towards the viewer with clearly defined fingers that do not exceed five digits, maintaining anatomical accuracy. The textures of the hand also appear suitably detailed with no signs of artificial alteration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the spotlight effects in the grayscale 3D chibi world consistent with the dancer's pose, contributing to a natural and visually plausible scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While assessing the edited image B in terms of spotlight effects, the environment indicates no evident spotlight effects are applied, implying that this question may not correctly refer to image B's grayscale aspects. Therefore, a 'No' option is appropriate since spotlight effects are not featured.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition adhere to the 2:3 aspect ratio, with the dancer and portal positioned in a balanced manner that enhances visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is evaluated regarding its composition and aspect ratio. The overall framing appears balanced, but without explicit evidence of a 2:3 aspect ratio due to the squared cropping appearance. The positioning seems even, maintaining a balanced visual despite the lack of direct adherence to a 2:3 ratio.",
