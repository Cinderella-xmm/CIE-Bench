      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style character maintain proper proportions and avoid unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a chibi style, characterized by exaggerated proportions such as a larger head and smaller body. This is typical of chibi design, which commonly maintains consistent proportions to enhance cuteness without creating any distortions. This style is prevalent in animated characters. Therefore, the proportions in Image B align with the standard aesthetic of chibi designs.",

      "question": "Are the warm, golden hues of the surreal landscape preserved without introducing unnatural textures or color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coloration of the landscape is characterized by warm, golden hues that are typical of a desert setting, providing a sense of surrealism. These colors harmonize well with the overall mood of the image without any unnatural texture or color shifts. Visual elements in the scene, like the sunlit terrain, aid in maintaining this consistency.",

      "question": "Does the interaction between the 3D chibi-style character and the echidna appear natural and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a chibi-style character and an echidna interacting in a natural manner. The stance of the character, her bent knees, and a hand on her hip suggest a natural interaction. The echidna is also proportionately designed to appear realistic, matching the stylized but grounded approach common in animated settings. Thus, the interaction appears undistorted and believable.",

      "question": "Do the clothing and accessories of the 3D chibi-style character retain their fine details without unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing and accessories, such as shorts and goggles, exhibit fine details without signs of unnatural texture. The smooth lines and simple yet detailed design remain consistent with the aesthetics of a 3D chibi rendering, which typically maintains detailed yet simplified features suitable for animation.",

      "question": "Is the confident pose of the 3D chibi-style character structurally consistent and visually credible within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B displays a confident pose with hands on her hips, a common stance indicating self-assurance. The body posture and alignment appear structurally coherent with the typical chibi representation, keeping the visual credibility within the fantastical, yet rational context of the scene.",
