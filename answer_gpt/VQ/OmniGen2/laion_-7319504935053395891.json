      "question": "Are the cutout windows on each tier aligned with the chocolate drops and have smooth, uninterrupted edges without jagged or fragmented borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cutout windows on each tier are examined for alignment with the chocolate drops and the smoothness of their edges. The windows appear seamlessly integrated with the chocolate, maintaining consistent shapes and borders without any jaggedness or fragmentation. This suggests careful design, allowing the windows to serve a decorative purpose while ensuring aesthetic harmony with the chocolate drops.",

      "question": "Does the gold foiling applied across the surface show uniform reflectivity and smooth transitions without visible seams, pixelation, or overly bright spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold foiling in Image B is analyzed by observing its reflectivity and transitions on the surface. The foiling exudes a consistent uniform reflectivity, with smooth transitions enhancing the golden lustre. It is free from any seams, pixelation, or excessively bright spots, indicating controlled application and high-quality imaging techniques. This impression of quality is achieved through realistic light reflections and material hue representation.",

      "question": "Are the nut embellishments attached to the chocolate surface with natural positioning, showing correct shadows and depth, and no floating or misplaced instances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nuts displayed in Image B are assessed based on their positioning and interaction with the chocolate surface. They show realistic attachment with accurate shadowing, creating depth and visual authenticity. There are no instances of floating or misplacement, as they rest naturally upon the chocolate tiers, contributing to the structural and decorative design of the chocolate tower.",

      "question": "Are the sparkle effects evenly distributed and faint enough to resemble light reflections on chocolate, without forming clusters or sharp, unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, sparkle effects are evaluated for distribution and appearance. The sparkles are evenly dispersed across the tiers, designed to mimic natural light reflections rather than form distracting clusters. They are subtly integrated into the chocolate’s surface, avoiding harsh or unnatural visual highlights that would detract from the perceived quality and realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the new text “ChocoConifer Delights” clearly readable, properly spaced, and integrated into the base without overlapping or distorting the surrounding chocolate ring or motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text “ChocoConifer Delights” in Image B is scrutinized for legibility and integration. It is clearly readable, benefiting from appropriate spacing and typographical alignment that preserves the aesthetic of the chocolate base. There is no overlapping or distortion observed in the surrounding chocolate motifs, indicating an intentional and precise design that maintains visual cohesion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the tiers of the tower evenly spaced and aligned vertically, preserving the original conical shape without bulging, shrinking, or skewed angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical alignment and spacing of the tiers are evaluated to confirm the retention of the original conical shape. The tiers display uniform spacing and alignment, which maintains the integrity of the tower's conical silhouette. There are no signs of bulging, shrinking, or skewed angles, indicating meticulous design consistency throughout the structure.",
