      "question": "Do the celestial sails replacing the elephant's ears maintain a consistent size and attachment point relative to the head, without warping or unnatural stretching of the surrounding skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the celestial sails resemble triangular patterns and appear well-integrated into the composition of the elephant's shape. The attachment seems stable relative to the head without noticeable stretching or warping. The design considers the elephant's ear placement by adhering closely to its anatomical possibilities, ensuring that the skin around the ears appears natural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cosmic mist emanating from the tip of the trunk smoothly integrated into the scene without jagged edges, overlapping artifacts, or inconsistent opacity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features cosmic mist patterns at the trunk's tip. These cosmic elements extend from the trunk and blend smoothly with the surrounding space theme, maintaining consistent opacity and a natural blending transition without visible jagged edges or overlapping artifacts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the planetary rings around the elephant's legs evenly spaced and aligned with the limb axes, without clipping into the leg surface or appearing misaligned due to perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, planetary rings are situated around the elephant's legs. These rings exhibit even spacing and align well with the elephant's limb axes. There are no signs of clipping or misalignment due to perspective. The rings integrate seamlessly into the design, complementing the cosmic theme effectively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the luminescent star patterns on the elephant’s feet appear embedded within the foot surface rather than floating above it, with no haloing or color spill onto adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows luminescent star patterns appearing on the feet. Unlike floating designs, they are embedded within the foot surface and are devoid of any halo effect or undesired color spills onto adjacent regions, ensuring a clean and visually coherent aspect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the galaxy-patterned skin follow the natural folds and creases of the elephant’s body, maintaining consistent texture resolution and avoiding abrupt transitions or stretched patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The galaxy pattern on Image B follows the natural anatomical folds and creases typical of elephant skin. The pattern maintains consistent texture resolution across the body. No abrupt transitions or stretched patterns are evident, ensuring an artistic and realistic blending with the inherent form.",
