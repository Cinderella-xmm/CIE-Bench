      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the motion lines surrounding the character in Panel 1 smoothly aligned with the direction of motion and free from jagged edges or inconsistent spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motion lines in Panel 1 are there to emphasize the character's movement, which in this comic is a jump forward. The lines should ideally follow the rhythm and direction of the jump, smoothly transitioning in line with the character's motion. Based on the visual inspection of the image, the motion lines appear to be aligned with the pose and direction of the character's movement, without visible jagged edges or inconsistent spacing that would imply poor alignment or graphic instability.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the internal monologue bubble positioned close to the character’s head without overlapping facial features or distorting the character’s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubbles containing the character's internal monologue should be placed strategically close to the character's head to not interfere with the visibility of the character's facial features or outline. In the image, the speech bubble is positioned above and to the left of the character's head, away from the face, allowing the character’s outline to remain unaltered and the focus clear.",

      "question": "Does the sky background in Panel 1 display a smooth gradient from warm to cool tones without visible color bands or unnatural transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in the background of Panel 1 should have a gradient that smoothly transitions from one hue to another to achieve a natural look typical for sky scenes, particularly during sunset or sunrise. Upon examination, the sky appears to transition naturally between warm hues near the horizon to cooler tones higher up, maintaining a smooth continuity without any noticeable color banding or abrupt shifts that would disrupt the visual harmony.",

      "question": "Is the parachute in Panel 2 correctly shaped, proportionally sized relative to the character, and connected by visible cords that extend logically from the character’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2, the parachute should be shaped appropriately, sized proportionally to the character, and show clear connections to the character via cords. Analyzing the panel, the parachute appears to be correctly curved, large enough to function as intended for a character of this size, and the cords are visibly and logically extending from what would be the character's back area. This suggests a coherent design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the animated clouds in both panels appear as distinct volumetric forms with soft edges and no clipping into the character or mountain silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds depicted should maintain volume and smoothness, featuring soft edges that create a distinct atmospheric element separate from the character and mountain silhouettes. Upon reviewing both panels, the clouds indeed appear as distinct and volumetric, with soft, rounded edges avoiding any overlap or clipping issues with other elements in the scene, maintaining the integrity and separation of all forms.",
