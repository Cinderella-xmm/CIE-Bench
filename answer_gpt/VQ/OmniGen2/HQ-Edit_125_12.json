      "question": "Does the marble texture beneath the teapot exhibit natural veining and color variation without abrupt edges or artificial patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base upon which the teapot rests exhibits a marble texture, characterized by veins and color variations. It appears smooth and continuous which is typical for marble, without any abrupt edges or patterns that seem artificial. The visual cues indicate an elegant, authentic marble style rather than a synthetic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the transparent label positioned on the teapotâ€™s body with uniform opacity and no visible pixelation or ghosting around the text edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label on the teapot in Image B features text saying 'Earl Grey Elegance.' Visually analyzing the label, it maintains uniform opacity and clarity over the teapot surface. The text edges are sharp, with no pixelation or ghosting effects which would usually suggest poor graphic implementation or unfinished editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the gold monogram on the lid align with the surrounding engravings in terms of depth, shadow, and metallic finish, without appearing raised or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the lid of the teapot in Image B, there is a gold monogram. Examining its integration with the engravings reveals consistency in terms of depth, shadow effects, and metallic finish. It visually integrates well with the surrounding elements without appearing separately raised or detached, suggesting a harmonious design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the box positioned adjacent to the teapot with correct perspective and scale, and does it feature consistent engraving patterns and material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the box next to the teapot aligns appropriately with the perspective and scale relative to the teapot. The engraving patterns and material appearance are consistent with the overall aesthetic of the scene, maintaining an elegant continuity without disruptive mismatches.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the teapot and box consistent with the light source direction and do they match the ambient lighting of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, shadows cast by the teapot and box indicate a consistent light source from the top left direction based on the position of shadows. The shadow intensity and direction match well with the ambient light in the scene, adhering to realistic lighting physics without overt discrepancies.",
